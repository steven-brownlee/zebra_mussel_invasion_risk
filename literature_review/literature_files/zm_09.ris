T1  - Switches, stability and reversals: the evolutionary history of sexual systems in fish
AN  - 2505702302
AB  - Sexual systems are highly diverse and have profound consequences for population dynamics and resilience. Yet, little is known about how they evolved. Using phylogenetic Bayesian modelling and a sample of 4614 species, we show that gonochorism is the likely ancestral condition in teleost fish. While all hermaphroditic forms revert quickly to gonochorism, protogyny and simultaneous hermaphroditism are evolutionarily more stable than protandry. In line with theoretical expectations, simultaneous hermaphroditism does not evolve directly from gonochorism but can evolve slowly from sequential hermaphroditism, particularly protandry. We find support for the predictions from life history theory that protogynous, but not protandrous, species live longer than gonochoristic species and invest the least in male gonad mass. The distribution of sexual systems of teleosts on the tree of life does not seem to reflect just adaptive predictions, suggesting that adaptations alone may not fully explain why some sexual forms evolve in some taxa but not others (Williams' paradox). We propose that future studies should incorporate mating systems, spawning behaviours, and the diversity of sex determining mechanisms. Some of the latter might constrain the evolution of hermaphroditism, while the non-duality of the embryological origin of teleost gonads might explain why protogyny predominates over protandry in teleosts.

 Footnotes 
* We have revised the assignment of the sexual system of all hermaphrodites and thus updated our dataset. We consider hermaphrodites only the species for which functional hermaphroditism has been proved in the primary literature. Details can be found in the Materials & Methods section, and an overview of all the process of data acquisition and curation is presented the new Suppl. Fig. 1, which also indicates the source of the phylogenetic tree used. Mating systems and spawning behavior definitions have been improved and clarified. Some of the predictions of life history theory have been clarified and all the analyses are now corrected for allometry. Thus, - figures 2, 4 and 5 revised. - tables 2 and 3 revised. - new figure 3 uploaded. Most of the conclusions of our study hold although some results using this new dataset change slightly. Specifically, we still find that: i) both types of sequential hermaphroditism can evolve slowly from gonochorism and revert quickly to it; ii) protogyny is lost at low rate to protandry and simultaneous hermaphroditism; iii) protandry is not evolutionarily stable and is quickly lost to gonochorism, protogyny and, to a lesser degree, simultaneous hermaphroditism. However, we now find that simultaneous hermaphroditism does not evolve directly from gonochorism but via sequential hermaphroditism, most likely protandry, thus confirming theoretical predictions. In addition, simultaneous hermaphroditism is more likely to be lost to gonochorism than to either form of sequential hermaphroditism. Analyses on life history traits confirm that protogynous (but not protandrous) species live longer than gonochoristic and present the smallest GSI. With the new dataset we no longer find evidence that protandrous species are smaller and mature later than protogynous species.

T1  - Some Thoughts about the Evolution of Human Behavior: a Literature Survey
AN  - 2537146836
AB  - On his death, Arthur Boucot (1924-2017) left an unfinished manuscript in which he surveyed the skeletal, behavioural, and cultural changes that have characterized Homo from its first recognition in the Late Pliocene to the present. The subjects he treated were as varied as the preparation of food for infants, the length of intestines, hafting, plastering, use of flint and metals, the domestication of grains and animals, and the prevalence of parasitic diseases. His text repeatedly notes the difficulties imposed by the enormous gaps in both fossil and archaeological records. Boucot deduced a continuity in basic human behaviours from the Oldowan and Acheulian into modern forms, and made a point of including Neandertals and Denisovans. But he also pointed out that morphological changes in successive species of Homo do not coincide in time with major changes in lithic technologies. Boucot concluded that a quantum evolutionary gap separates hominins from the great apes: that members of our line were sapient and had been using language long before they became sapiens. In his text he also indicates his concern for changes to the environment wrought by human activities. The results of this late-life effort, edited after his death, provide a heavily referenced sourcebook for future workers in diverse fields.

T1  - Improving water quality does not guarantee fish health: effects of ammonia pollution on the behaviour of wild-caught pre-exposed fish
AN  - 2507153146
AB  - Abstract
Ammonia is a pollutant frequently found in aquatic ecosystems. In fish, ammonia can cause physical damage, alter its behaviour and even cause death. Exposure to ammonia also increases fish physiological stress, which can be measured through biomarkers. In this study, we analysed the effect of sublethal ammonia concentrations on the behaviour and the oxidative stress of Barbus meridionalis that had been pre-exposed to this compound in the wild. Wild-caught fish from a polluted site (pre-exposed fish) and from an unpolluted site (non-pre-exposed fish) were exposed, under experimental conditions, to total ammonia concentrations (TAN) of 0, 1, 5 and 8 mg/L. Swimming activity, feeding behaviour and oxidative stress response based on biomarkers were analysed. Pre-exposed fish showed both an altered behaviour and an altered oxidative stress response in the control treatment (0 mg/L). Differences in swimming activity were also found as pre-exposed fish swam less. Lower feeding activity (voracity and satiety) and altered response to oxidative stress were also observed at ≥ 1 mg/L TAN. Biomarker results confirmed pre-exposed fish suffer from a reduction in their antioxidant defences and, hence, showed increased oxidative tissue damage. In summary, pre-exposed fish showed more sensitivity to ammonia exposure than fish from a pristine site.

T1  - Growing Wild:&nbsp;The Correspondence of a Pioneering Woman Naturalist from the Cape
AN  - 2472562558
AB  - Mary Elizabeth Barber (1818-1899), born in Britain, arrived in the Cape Colony in 1820 where she spent the rest of her life as a rolling stone, as she lived in and near Grahamstown, the diamond and gold fields, Pietermaritzburg, Malvern near Durban and on various farms in the eastern part of the Cape Colony. She has been perceived as 'the most advanced woman of her time', yet her legacy has attracted relatively little attention. She was the first woman ornithologist in South Africa, one of the first who propagated Darwin's theory of evolution, an early archaeologist, keen botanist and interested lepidopterist. In her scientific writing, she propagated a new gender order; positioned herself as a feminist avant la lettre without relying on difference models and at the same time made use of genuinely racist argumentation. This is the first publication of her edited scientific correspondence. The letters -- transcribed by Alan Cohen, who has written a number of biographical articles on Barber and her brothers -- are primarily addressed to the entomologist Roland Trimen, the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, London. Today, the letters are housed at the Royal Entomological Society in St Albans. This book also includes a critical introduction by historian Tanja Hammel who has published a number of articles and is about to publish a monograph on Mary Elizabeth Barber.Mary Elizabeth Barber (1818�1899), born in Britain, arrived in the Cape Colony in 1820 where she spent the rest of her life as a rolling stone, as she lived in and near Grahamstown, the diamond and gold fields, Pietermaritzburg, Malvern near Durban and on various farms in the eastern part of the Cape Colony.

T1  - Response of coral reef dinoflagellates to nanoplastics under experimental conditions
AN  - 2508140444
AB  - Abstract
Plastic products contribute heavily to anthropogenic pollution of the oceans. Small plastic particles in the micro- and nanoscale ranges have been found in all marine ecosystems, but little is known about their effects upon marine organisms. In this study we examine changes in cell growth, aggregation, and gene expression of two symbiotic dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, Symbiodinium tridacnidorum (clade A3) and Cladocopium sp. (clade C), under exposure to 42-nm polystyrene beads. In laboratory experiments, cell number and aggregation were reduced after 10 days of nanoplastic exposure at 0.01, 0.1, and 10 mg/L concentrations, but no clear correlation with plastic concentration was observed. Genes involved in dynein motor function were upregulated compared to control conditions, while genes related to photosynthesis, mitosis, and intracellular degradation were downregulated. Overall, nanoplastic exposure led to more genes being downregulated than upregulated and the number of genes with altered expression was larger in Cladocopium sp. than in S. tridacnidorum, suggesting different sensitivity to nanoplastic between species. Our data show that nanoplastic inhibits growth and alters aggregation properties of microalgae, which may negatively affect the uptake of these indispensable symbionts by coral reef organisms.

T1  - Embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of polyethylene microbeads found in facial wash products in Zebrafish (Danio rerio) using the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test
AN  - 2508218002
AB  - Abstract
Use of polyethylene beads in facial cleansers has been continuously questioned by scientific communities for they adversely affect aquatic organisms once these beads find their way into their habitats. This study specifically aims to determine Danio rerio mortality rate using lethal endpoints and to evaluate sublethal teratogenic effects in Danio rerio due to polyethylene microbead exposure. Danio rerio, a model organism for ecotoxicology, was subjected to the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test. Embryos were exposed to polyethylene microbead suspensions (PE-MBS) of varying concentrations (i.e., 20 μg/L, 200 μg/L, 2000 μg/L). They were also exposed to 5% ethanol (positive control), reconstituted water (negative control), 0.01% Tween 80 (emulsifier control), and 1% DMSO (solvent control). Toxicological endpoints (i.e., egg coagulation, lack of somite formation, non-detachment of tail, and lack of heartbeat) were observed every 24 hours until the 96th hour exposure. Hatching was observed from 48 hpf while teratogenicity was observed at 144 hpf. Significant differences between means and variances were observed for all treatment groups in relation to the negative control. For all groups, 0.01% Tween 80, 1% DMSO and 20 μg/L PE-MBS did not significantly differ with the negative control due to negligible concentration but 5% ethanol and higher concentrations of PE-MBS did. This indicated that high concentrations of PE-MBS exposure may induce early hatching, mortality, increased malformation, and increased heart rate. Tukey Kramer post hoc Test substantiated that PE-MBS toxicity is dose dependent since embryotoxicity and teratogenicity increases at higher concentrations. LC50 obtained using probit analysis based on experimental data was 2455.096 μg/L, and was higher than the concentrations used in this study. Further studies should be conducted to know more about the adverse effects of polyethylene microbeads to the biota.

T1  - Pharmaceutical Residues in Freshwater: Hazards and Policy Responses
AN  - 2431589624
AB  - This report calls for a better understanding of the effects of pharmaceutical residues in the environment, greater international collaboration and accountability distribution, and policy actions to prevent and remedy emerging concerns. Laboratory and field tests show traces of oral contraceptives causing the feminisation of fish and amphibians, and residues of psychiatric drugs altering fish behaviour. Antimicrobial resistance, linked to the overuse of antibiotics, has rapidly escalated into a global health crisis. Unless adequate measures are taken to manage the risks, pharmaceutical residues will increasingly be released into the environment as ageing populations, advances in healthcare, and intensification of meat and fish production spur the demand for pharmaceuticals worldwide. The report outlines a collective, life?cycle approach to managing pharmaceuticals in the environment. A policy mix of source?directed, use?orientated and end?of?pipe measures, involving several policy sectors, can help to improve health and protect the environment.

T1  - Wasserbezogene Anpassungsmaßnahmen an den Landschafts- und Klimawandel
AN  - 2434168225
AB  - Der allgegenwärtige Landschafts- und Klimawandel hat vielfältige Auswirkungen auf unsere Umwelt. Wie beeinflussen wasserbezogene Anpassungsmaßnahmen in Regionen und Flusseinzugsgebieten Deutschlands diese Auswirkungen? Antworten und Lösungen werden in diesem Band präsentiert. Anhand praktischer Beispiele zeigen die Autoren, dass der Klimawandel real ist und wir auf Jahrzehnte hinaus mit diesem Problem konfrontiert sein werden. Weil die Klimaveränderung nicht beherrschbar ist, muss sich die Gesellschaft anpassen. Notwendige Anpassungsmaßnahmen zur Erhaltung der Ressource Wasser erweisen sich als regionale und lokale Herausforderung. Sie erfordern Handeln auf verschiedenen Ebenen: auf lokaler Ebene und im Bereich der Flüsse und Flusseinzugsgebiete; deshalb bedarf es der Abstimmung zwischen Bund, Land und Kommunen. Die Autoren stellen dar, welche Maßnahmen z.B. in der brandenburgischen Lausitz  durch Braunkohlebergbau wasser- und stoffhaushaltlich nachhaltig beeinträchtigt  umgesetzt werden, und verdeutlichen, dass der Klimawandel weiteren Handlungsbedarf erforderlich macht. Notwendige und optionale Wassermanagement-Maßnahmen werden am Beispiel des Rheins und der Elbe aufgezeigt und anhand der gegenwärtigen und der künftigen Ziel-Situation  u.a. im wasserreichen Freistaat Bayern und im wasserarmen Nordostdeutschland  umfassend diskutiert. Die Autoren erörtern ausführlich neue Ansätze und Instrumente zur gesellschaftlichen Steuerung wasserbezogener Anpassungsmaßnahmen, z.B. in Form intensiver Öffentlichkeitsbeteiligung und einer angepassten Infrastruktur der regionalen Wasserversorgung. Zahlreiche aktuelle Beispiele für die technische, wirtschaftliche und infrastrukturelle Gestaltung dieses Wandels u. a. durch angepasste Verfahren in der Bewässerung, des ökologischen Waldbaus, der Wasseraufbereitung und -versorgung sowie des Hochwasserrisikomanagements vervollständigen die angestellten Überlegungen. Dieser Band richtet sich an Akteure und Entscheidungsträger in Wissenschaft, Politik, Institutionen, Behörden, Verwaltungen und Verbänden sowie an die interessierte Öffentlichkeit.

Dieser Band richtet sich an Akteure und Entscheidungsträger in Wissenschaft, Politik, Institutionen, Behörden, Verwaltungen und Verbänden sowie an die interessierte Öffentlichkeit. Wasser und Abfall 10/2012 Landschafts- und Klimawandel haben Auswirkungen auf alle Umweltmedien, Anpassungsmaßnahmen sind in allen Bereichen, insbesondere im Bereich Wasser, notwendig. Welche Auswirkungen aber haben diese wasserbezogenen Anpassungsmaßnahmen auf die Umwelt? Antworten auf diese Frage bietet das neu erschienene Buch Wasserbezogene Anpassungsmaßnahmen an den Landschafts- und Klimwandel. Im Mittelpunkt des Buches stehen praktische Beispiele. Die Autoren stellen die landschaftsbaulichen Maßnahmen im Braunkohleabbaugebiet der Lausitz vor und diskutieren den dort vorhandenen weiteren Handlungsbedarf aufgrund des Klimawandels. Notwendige und optionale Wassermanagement-Maßnahmen zeigen sie anhand des Rheins und der Elbe auf. Auch die Unterschiede zwischen wasserreichen Bundesländern wie Bayern und wasserarmen Ländern in Nordostdeutschland kommen zur Sprache. Aktuelle Beispiele für die technische, wirtschaftliche und infrastrukturelle Gestaltung des Wandels durch angepasste Verfahren runden das Buch ab. Korrespondenz Wasserwirtschaft 2012 (5) Nr. 11 29 Beiträge von einzelnen oder mehreren Autoren enthalten in 6 Kapiteln zusammenfassend die wichtigsten Ergebnisse eines Fachsymposium (22. bis 24.6.2011) in Großräschen in der im Umbruch befindlichen Bergbaufolgelandschaft der Niederlausitz. Die einzelnen Kapitelüberschriften lauten: - Einführung, - Landschaftswandel, globaler Wandel und regionale Anpassung: Perspektiven, - Landschaftswandel und wasserbezogene Anpassungsmaßnahmen am Beispiel der Region Lausitz, - Wasserbezogene Anpassungsmaßnahmen in Regionen und Flusseinzugsgebieten, - Ansätze und Instrumente zur gesellschaftlichen Steuerung wasserbezogener Anpassungsmaßnahmen, - Technische, wirtschaftliche und infrastrukturelle Gestaltung des Wandels. Die neuen Ansätze und Instrumente zur gesellschaftlichen Steuerung wasserbezogener Anpassungsmaßnahmen werden durch zahlreiche Beispiele für die technische, wirtschaftliche und infrastrukturelle Gestaltung des Wandels vervollständigt. Interessant ist das Buch für Akteure und Entscheidungsträger in Wissenschaft, Politik, Institutionen, Behörden, Verwaltungen und Verbänden sowie die interessierte Öffentlichkeit. K. Lecher, Hannover Wasser und Umwelt H. 1 Jg. 8 Anhand praktischer Beispiele beleuchten die Autoren im Band, dass der Klimawandel real ist und wir über Generationen mit den Auswirkungen konfrontiert sein werden. Notwendige Anpassungsmaßnahmen zur Erhaltung der Ressource Wasser erweisen sich als regionale und lokale Herausforderung. Sie erfordern Handeln auf verschiedenen Ebenen: auf lokaler Ebene und im Bereich der Flüsse und Flusseinzugsgebiete. Deshalb bedarf es dringend der Abstimmung zwischen Bund, Ländern und Kommunen. Die Autoren zeigen, welche auf den Klimawandel bezogenen Maßnahmen z.B. in der brandenburgischen Lausitz, einer bereits durch Braunkohlebergbau nachhaltig beeinträchtigten Region, umgesetzt werden können. Notwendige und optionale Wassermanagement-Maßnahmen werden außerdem am Beispiel des Rheins und der Elbe aufgezeigt. Die Autoren erörtern ausführlich neue Ansätze und Instrumente zur gesellschaftlichen Steuerung wasserbezogener Anpassungsmaßnahmen, z.B. in Form intensiver Öffentlichkeitsbeteiligungen und einer angepassten Infrastruktur der regionalen Wasserversorgung. Zahlreiche aktuelle Beispiele für die technische, wirtschaftliche und infrastrukturelle Gestaltung dieses Wandels durch angepasste Verfahren in der Bewässerung, des ökologischen Waldbaus, der Wasseraufbereitung und -versorgung sowie des Hochwasserrisikomanagements und weiteren Möglichkeiten vervollständigen die angestellten Überlegungen.

T1  - The Life of North American Suburbs
AN  - 2371194312
AB  - This book chronicles and explains the role of suburbs in North American cities since the mid-twentieth century. Examining fifteen case studies from New York to Vancouver, Atlanta to Chicago, Montreal to Phoenix, 
The Life
of North American Suburbs traces the insightful connection between the evolution of suburbs and the cultural dynamics of modern society. Suburbs are uniquely significant spaces: their creation and evolution reflect the shifting demographics, race relations, modes of production, cultural fabric, and class structures of society at large. The case studies investigate the place of suburbs within their wider metropolitan constellations: the crucial role they play in the cultural, economic, political, and spatial organization of the city. Together, the chapters paint a compelling portrait of North American cities and their dynamic suburban landscapes.

T1  - Imagining Regulation Differently
AN  - 2351284229
AB  - There is an urgent need to rethink relationships between systems of government and those who are 'governed'. This book explores ways of rethinking those relationships by bringing communities normally excluded from decision-making to centre stage to experiment with new methods of regulating for engagement. Using original, co-produced research, it innovatively shows how we can better use a 'bottom-up' approach to design regulatory regimes that recognise the capabilities of communities at the margins and powerfully support the knowledge, passions and creativity of citizens. The authors provide essential guidance for all those working on co-produced research to make impactful change.There is an urgent need to rethink the relationships between systems of government and those who are 'governed'. The contemporary transfer of state regulation to the market-based regulation of corporate interests has marginalised many communities in the regulatory systems of everyday life. Exploring a broad range of intersecting areas including immigration, social work, food regulation, space and surveillance, older people, ethnicity and faith, this book takes a 'bottom up' approach that brings to the fore the experiences and expertise of these communities in order to examine ways that we can better design regulatory systems that support the knowledge and creativity of citizens.

T1  - In Different Times:&nbsp;The War for Southern Africa 1966-1989
AN  - 2438703440
AB  - This is the first attempt to bring together diverse scholars, using different lenses, to study South Africa's Border War. As a book, it is critical in approach, provides deeper reflection, and focuses specifically on the SADF experience of the war. The result is a more complex picture of the war's dynamics and its legacies. Although South Africa is a vastly different country today, the study of the Border War opens a range of questions, also relevant to contemporary deployments such as in Lesotho (1998) and the Central African Republic (2013). It includes the debate on participation in foreign conflicts; on the deployment, design and preparation of appropriate, modern armed forces and their use as foreign policy instruments in far‑off theatres; on military planning; and, as the historical controversies regarding the battles at Cuito Cuanavale and Bangui illustrate, on the interface between foreign campaigning and domestic politics.

T1  - Snakes, People, and Spirits, Volume One:&nbsp;Traditional Eastern Africa in Its Broader Context
AN  - 2314950921
AB  - This two-volume publication offers an in-depth analysis of ophidian symbolism in Eastern Africa, while setting the topic within its regional and historical context: namely, with regards to the rest of Africa, ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Greek world, ancient Palestine, Arabia, India, and medieval and pre-Christian Europe. Through the ages, most of those areas have connected with Eastern Africa in a broad sense, where ophidian symbolism was as "rampant" and far-reaching, if not more so, as anywhere else on the continent, and perhaps in past civilisations. Much as in the wider context, snakes were held to be long-lived, closely related to holes, caverns, trees, and water, life and death, and credited with a liking for milk. Even though ophidian symbolism has always been developed out of the outstanding biological and ethological features of snakes, the process of symbolisation, which plays a crucial role in the elaboration of cultural systems and the shaping of human experience, was inevitably at work. This first volume deals with snakes as a zoological category; snake symbolism as perceived by encyclopaedists and psychologists; and ophidian symbolism as it occurred in ancient civilisations. It explores the traditional African scene in general with a view to set the scene for a more proximate baseline for comparison. The divide between animals and humans was porous, and snakes had a more or less equal footing in both the animal realm and the spiritual world. Key features of snake symbolism in traditional Eastern Africa are then examined in detail, especially phantasmagorical snakes, the rainbow serpent, snake-totems, and snake-related witches and ritual leaders, among others. In Eastern Africa, the meanings attributed to snakes were multifaceted and paradoxical. Overall, the two volumes of this publication show that African snake symbolism broadly echoed the diverse representations of ancient civilisations. The widely acknowledged assimilation of snakes to death and Evil is therefore unrepresentative, both historically and culturally.

T1  - Humans and Animals: Intersecting Lives and Worlds
AN  - 2491409356
AB  - This volume was first published by Inter-Disciplinary Press in 2016.
 
 
 
 "Relationships between humans and non-human animals are deeply complex and often governed by tensions and paradoxes. Both wild and domestic, metaphorical and real, assistants and adversaries, animals effortlessly bridge cultural and natural spaces and form an integral part of human lives. This volume addresses several currently debated topics in science and culture: How shall we rethink, rebuild and re-envision our relationships with other animals? How do we construct ideas of 'the animal'? How can we negotiate animal interests against our own? In which ways do we make sense - and use - of animals in 'human' cultural spaces? Addressing the non-human animal from the standpoint of various social and cultural constructions from a global and multidisciplinary perspective, the chapters within this volume do not seek to answer these questions, but rather to draw attention to the complexity of the underlying issues and the manifold dimensions of the animal-human bond."

T1  - The Squatters:&nbsp;The Story of Australia's Pastoral Pioneers
AN  - 2159897232
AB  - Fascinating stories of the indomitable men and women who established the first cattle and sheep properties that became the foundation of a prosperous nation.
 
 'A very readable history of an important group of Australian pioneers' - Graham Seal, author of the bestselling Great Australian Stories
 

For the early settlers who came from Britain's crowded cities and tiny villages, it must have been extraordinarily liberating to pack their belongings onto a bullock dray and head beyond the reach of meddlesome authorities to claim new land for themselves.
 
 Settlers spread out across inland Australia constructing windmills and fences, dry-stone walls and storehouses, livestock yards and droving routes, the traces of which can still be seen today. The fortunate and indomitable succeeded, while countless others succumbed to drought and flood. Those who were successful became a class all their own: the scrub aristocrats.
 
 Barry Stone has scoured through diaries, journals and newspapers, and sorted myth from legend. He tells the stories of pioneers whose vision and hard work built pastoral empires running thousands of head of stock, providing meat for a growing colony and wool for export, a rural juggernaut that would lay the foundations of a prosperous nation.

T1  - Apoptosis and Beyond:&nbsp;The Many Ways Cells Die
AN  - 2134549191
AB  - APOPTOSIS AND BEYOND: THE MANY WAYS CELLS DIE 

These volumes teach readers to think beyond apoptosis and describes all of the known processes that cells can undergo which result in cell death 
This two-volume set is the first comprehensive collection to cover all of the known processes that cells undergo when they die. It is also the only one of its kind to compare these processes. It seeks to enlighten those in the field and stimulate their thinking by looking at these pathways when their research system does not show classic signs of apoptotic pathway activation. In addition, it links activities like the molecular biology of one process to another (e.g. Necrosis to Apoptosis) and contrasts those that are closely related. 
Volume 1 of 
Apoptosis and Beyond: The Many Ways Cells Die begins with a general view of the cytoplasmic and nuclear features of apoptosis. It then goes on to offer chapters on targeting the cell death mechanism; microbial programmed cell death; autophagy; cell injury, adaptation, and necrosis; necroptosis; ferroptosis; anoikis; pyronecrosis; and more. Volume 2 covers subjects such as phenoptosis; pyroptosis; hematopoiesis and eryptosis; cyclophilin d-dependent necrosis; and the role of phospholipase in cell death. 
 
Covers all the known processes that dying cells undergo 
Provides extensive coverage of a topic not fully covered before 
Offers chapters written by top researchers in the field 
Provides activities that link and contrast processes to each other  

Apoptosis and Beyond: The Many Ways Cells Die will appeal to students and researchers/clinicians in cell biology, molecular biology, oncology, and tumor biology.

T1  - Elemental:&nbsp;A Collection of Michigan Creative Nonfiction
AN  - 2133996236
AB  - Elemental: A Collection of Michigan Creative Nonfiction comes to us from twenty-three of Michigan’s most well-known essayists. A celebration of the elements, this collection is both the storm and the shelter. In her introduction, editor Anne-Marie Oomen recalls the "ritual dousing" of her storytelling group’s bonfire: "wind, earth, fire, water—all of it simultaneous in that one gesture. . . . In that moment we are bound together with these elements and with this place, the circle around the fire on the shores of a Great Lake closes, complete." The essays approach Michigan at the atomic level. This is a place where weather patterns and ecology matter. Farmers, miners, shippers, and loggers have built (or lost) their livelihood on Michigan’s nature—what could and could not be made out of our elements. From freshwater lakes that have shaped the ground beneath our feet to the industrial ebb and flow of iron ore and wind power—ours is a state of survival and transformation. In the first section of the book, "Earth," Jerry Dennis remembers working construction in northern Michigan. "Water" includes a piece from Jessica Mesman, who writes of the appearance of snow in different iterations throughout her life. The section "Wind" houses essays about the ungraspable nature of death from Toi Dericotte and Keith Taylor. "Fire" includes a piece by Mardi Jo Link, who recollects the unfortunate series of circumstances surrounding one of her family members. Elemental’s strength lies in its ability to learn from the past in the hope of defining a wiser future. A lot of literature can make this claim, but not all of it comes together so organically. Fans of nonfiction that reads as beautifully as fiction will love this collection.

T1  - Genome-scale fitness profile of Caulobacter crescentus grown in natural freshwater
AN  - 2068988560
AB  - Bacterial genomes evolve in complex ecosystems and are best understood in this natural context, but replicating such conditions in the lab is challenging. We used transposon sequencing to define the fitness consequences of gene disruption in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus grown in natural freshwater, compared to axenic growth in common laboratory media. Gene disruptions in amino acid and nucleotide sugar pathways and in metabolic substrate transport machinery impaired fitness in both lake water and defined minimal medium relative to complex peptone broth. Fitness in lake water was enhanced by insertions in genes required for flagellum biosynthesis and reduced by insertions in genes involved in biosynthesis of the holdfast surface adhesin. We further uncovered numerous hypothetical and uncharacterized genes for which disruption impaired fitness in lake water, defined minimal medium, or both. At the genome scale, the fitness profile of mutants cultivated in lake water was more similar to that in complex peptone broth than in defined minimal medium. Microfiltration of lake water did not significantly affect the terminal cell density or the fitness profile of the transposon mutant pool, suggesting that Caulobacter does not strongly interact with other microbes in this ecosystem on the measured timescale. Fitness of select mutants with defects in cell surface biosynthesis and environmental sensing were significantly more variable in lake water than in defined medium, presumably owing to day-to-day heterogeneity in the lake environment. This study reveals genetic interactions between Caulobacter and a natural freshwater environment, and provides a new avenue to study gene function in complex ecosystems.

T1  - Clovis Mammoth Butchery:&nbsp;The Lange/Ferguson Site and Associated Bone Tool Technology
AN  - 2148791954
AB  - Thirteen millennia ago, in a small creek valley in western South Dakota, two mammoths perished. The mammoths, an adult and a juvenile, likely a cow and calf pair, died at the edge of an ancient pond. The Lange/Ferguson site is the earliest dated archaeological site in South Dakota and one of the few North American sites that provides evidence of a Clovis-period mammoth butchering event. In addition to the preserved remains of the two mammoths, the site yielded diagnostic Clovis weaponry—three Clovis projectile points recovered in context and stratigraphically associated with the mammoth bonebed—and flaked bone tools. The site offers a rare snapshot in time detailing early Paleoindian interactions with now-extinct megafauna nearly 13,000 years ago. In Clovis Mammoth Butchery: The Lange/Ferguson Site and Associated Bone Tool Technology, L. Adrien Hannus provides a comprehensive look at one of the few New World Clovis-era sites with in-place buried deposits exhibiting evidence for an expedient bone tool technology. Multidisciplinary investigations include paleoenvironmental and geochronological reconstructions—pollen and phytoliths, geology and geomorphology, diatoms and ostracodes, mollusks, and vertebrate paleontology—as well as taphonomic evaluations and a microwear analysis of the chipped stone tools. Clovis Mammoth Butchery offers readers a rare glimpse into a singular moment in prehistory that captures human interaction with extinct animals during a rapidly changing world for which there is no modern comparison. This book shares great insight into hunting and procurement strategies used by big game hunters during the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene.

T1  - Vocal Health and Pedagogy: Science, Assessment,and Treatment, Third Edition
AN  - 2154959792
AB  - Now in one convenient volume, Vocal Health and Pedagogy: Science, Assessment, and Treatment, Third Edition answers every question you've ever had about the voice, from the physics of sounds, to vocal technique, to medications, to performance anxiety. It presents anatomical, physiological, and neurological considerations, as well as covers critical issues related to patient history, laryngeal function, the physical examination, and historical perspectives of vocal pedagogy. The first part of the book introduces basic concepts of voice science, assessment, and training. It focuses on the science behind the common problems that afflict voice users and enables understanding of the medical approach to problem analysis. The second part of the book contains additional information on the specific health and performance conditions that affect the voice and their assessment and treatment. It considers the medical and nonmedical issues affecting the human voice, including diagnosis and treatment of voice problems, the effects of physical injury, posture, pollutants and irritants, psychological effects, voice therapy, medication, and more. New to this edition: New chapters on topics such as pedagogy for children, the importance of studying music, laryngeal issues involving wind instrument performance, high-speed digital imaging, the evolution of technology, pediatric voice disorders, thyroid disorders, the vocal effects of birth control medications, and autoimmune disorders. Many chapters have been extensively revised to update previous content and add new information on material such as choral pedagogy for geriatric singers, World Trade Center syndrome, and laryngeal effects of asbestos exposure. Chapters on medications for performers have been revised to delete medications no longer used frequently and to add various medications and drug classes that were not included previously, as well as information on alternative and complementary medicines. References have been updated throughout to include discussion of new studies and a review of the latest literature, while also retaining the classic literature. Includes the most recent practices and techniques, the latest information on surgical and adjunctive therapy, and important changes in criteria and strategy. Vocal Health and Pedagogy: Science, Assessment, and Treatment, Third Edition is ideal for courses in vocal pedagogy and speech-language pathology. Additionally, it is a valuable resource for professional and amateur performers and their teachers.

AN  - 1951182659
AB  - Trumpian promises Paul Wells's "visit" with the folks of Elliott County, Ky., is further evidence of why voters are unqualified to judge policy issues ("In Trump they trust," International, October 2017).

[...]while most people are cognitively ­ill-equipped to judge the political value of policy proposals, there is one aspect of voter decision-making that most of us have some competence at.

A humane ending As a retired community nurse who was involved with people in their final weeks, days and hours, I commend Dr. Sandy Buchman's approach in allowing people personal dignity and control in the way they die ("The doctor who took on death," Medicine, ­September 2017).

To find Joseph Boyden's article, which confronts the issues that have partly divided our family during after-dinner discussions, was a revelation for which I am grateful: his argument was powerful and clear and makes me wonder about strict, scientific, DNA evidence of family lineage versus lifestyle issues and personal beliefs and relationships as a definition of one's origins.

T1  - Neurobiology of Motor Control:&nbsp;Fundamental Concepts and New Directions
AN  - 2133079738
AB  - A multi-disciplinary look at the current state of knowledge regarding motor control and movement--from molecular biology to robotics 
The last two decades have seen a dramatic increase in the number of sophisticated tools and methodologies for exploring motor control and movement. Multi-unit recordings, molecular neurogenetics, computer simulation, and new scientific approaches for studying how muscles and body anatomy transform motor neuron activity into movement have helped revolutionize the field. 
Neurobiology of Motor Control brings together contributions from an interdisciplinary group of experts to provide a review of the current state of knowledge about the initiation and execution of movement, as well as the latest methods and tools for investigating them. 
The book ranges from the findings of basic scientists studying model organisms such as mollusks and 
Drosophila, to biomedical researchers investigating vertebrate motor production to neuroengineers working to develop robotic and smart prostheses technologies. Following foundational chapters on current molecular biological techniques, neuronal ensemble recording, and computer simulation, it explores a broad range of related topics, including the evolution of motor systems, directed targeted movements, plasticity and learning, and robotics. 
 
Explores motor control and movement in a wide variety of organisms, from simple invertebrates to human beings 
Offers concise summaries of motor control systems across a variety of animals and movement types 
Explores an array of tools and methodologies, including electrophysiological techniques, neurogenic and molecular techniques, large ensemble recordings, and computational methods 
Considers unresolved questions and how current scientific advances may be used to solve them going forward  
 
Written specifically to encourage interdisciplinary understanding and collaboration, and offering the most wide-ranging, timely, and comprehensive look at the science of motor control and movement currently available, 
Neurobiology of Motor Control is a must-read for all who study movement production and the neurobiological basis of movement--from molecular biologists to roboticists.

T1  - Food Safety in China:&nbsp;Science, Technology, Management and Regulation
AN  - 2148373285
AB  - From contaminated infant formula to a spate of all-too-familiar headlines in recent years, food safety has emerged as one of the harsher realities behind China's economic miracle. 
Tainted beef, horse meat and dioxin outbreaks in the Western world have also put food safety in the global spotlight. 

Food Safety in China: Science, Technology, Management and Regulation presents a comprehensive overview of the history and current state of food safety in China, along with emerging regulatory trends and the likely future needs of the country. Although the focus is on China, global perspectives are presented in the chapters and 33 of the 99 authors are from outside China. Introductory chapters address such issues as the shared responsibility for food safety, the development of China's food industry, the current status of China's food safety, and educational and training courses designed to ensure food safety in China. The scientific aspects of food safety are explored next, with seven chapters on food microbiology, five on food chemistry and four chapters on risk assessment. A series of six chapters then addresses China's relatively new food laws and regulations, inspection methods and international trade. This is followed by a focus on six major commodity groups: meat, dairy, fruits and vegetables, fats and oils, cereals and seafood. Four concluding chapters discuss the application of innovative technologies to food safety. 
Timely and illuminating, 
Food Safety in China offers invaluable insights into our understanding of a critical link in the increasingly globalized complex food supply chain of today's world.

T1  - Solar-Energy-Absorbing Substances and Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Diseases
AN  - 2132891726
AB  - This book explores various topics relevant to understanding the complexities of biological effects generated by solar radiation. Solar-energy-absorbing substances are evaluated, including sunscreen agents, and their influence on cancers and diseases. One assumption is the use of sunscreen agents cannot prevent the photoinitiation of biological system malfunction, such as immunosuppression. On the contrary, sunscreens can help enhance the negative solar-energy-induced effects, such as by skin penetration. This collection offers critical appraisals of clinical studies involving vitamins and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents for alleviating, mitigating, or even curing of various inflammatory diseases including cancers.

T1  - The Handbook of Naturally Occurring Insecticidal Toxins
AN  - 2135013693
AB  - Naturally occurring toxins are among the most complicated and lethal in existence. Plant species, microorganisms and marine flora and fauna produce hundreds of toxic compounds for defence and to promote their chances of survival, and these can be isolated and appropriated for our own use. Many of these toxins have yet to be thoroughly described, despite being studied for years. Focusing on the natural toxins that are purely toxic to insects, this book contains over 500 chemical structures. It discusses the concepts and mechanisms involved in toxicity, bioassay procedures for evaluation, structure-activity relationships, and the potential for future commercialization of these compounds. A comprehensive review of the subject, this book forms an important source of information for researchers and students of crop protection, pest control, phytochemistry and those dealing in insect-plant interactions.

T1  - Perspectives on the Ancient Maya of Chetumal Bay
AN  - 2135576794
AB  - "Brings novel, synthetic insight to understanding a region that was a hub of waterborne trade and an important locus of production for some of the Maya's most valued crops."--Cynthia Robin, author of Everyday Life Matters: Maya Farmers at Chan "This one of a kind volume shows us how important this region was to the ancient Maya with detailed and vivid descriptions of sociopolitical and economic organization and their relation to the unique landscape and geography of Chetumal Bay."--Laura J. Kosakowsky, author of Preclassic Maya Pottery at Cuello, Belize Chetumal Bay is central to discussions of ancient Maya politics, warfare, economy, exchange and communication because of its unique location. Although the ancient Maya invested prodigious amounts of labor in the construction of road systems called sacbeob for communication and trade, recent archaeological discoveries around Chetumal Bay in both Belize and Mexico reveal an economic alternative to these roads: an extensive network of riverine and maritime waterways. Focusing on sites ringing the bay such as Cerro Maya, Oxtankah, and Santa Rita Corozal, the contributors to this volume explore how the bay and its feeder rivers affected all aspects of Maya culture from settlement, food production, and the production and use of special goods to political relationships and social organization. Besides being a nexus for long distance exchange in valuable materials such as jade and obsidian, the region was recognized for its high quality agricultural produce, including cacao, achiote, vanilla, local fruits, honey, and salt, and for its rich marine environment. The Maya living on the fringes of the bay perceived the entire region as a single resource procurement zone. Waterborne trade brought the world to them, providing a wider horizon than would have been available to inland cities dependent only on Maya roads for news of the world. The research reveals that trade relations played a central role in the organization of human social life on Chetumal Bay. Contributors: James Aimers | Timothy Beach | Clifford Brown | Beverly A.

T1  - Nutrient Speciation and Refractory Compounds in Water Quality Models
AN  - 2131425184
AB  - Water quality modeling efforts are designed to provide an understanding of watershed conditions to support management efforts that include control of point and nonpoint sources (NPS). Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) speciation is an important area of nutrient research, both in terms of biodegradability in wastewater treatment and bioavailability in the water environment. Water quality modeling may not be reflecting all that is known about point source effluent N and P from treatment facilities that reduce the total amount of nutrients discharged and also change N and P speciation and reduce bioavailability. WERF research into advanced levels of nutrient removal treatment is revealing new information about N and P speciation and reduced bioavailability of the N and P remaining after advanced treatment.Many of the more sophisticated mechanistic water quality models have the ability to simulate N and P species, and to some degree reflect refractory organic nutrient inputs and their subsequent degradation. Selecting water quality models with the capability of simulating nutrient species, and gathering monitoring data to characterize nutrient species and refractory compounds, is important to support enhancements in modeling.

T1  - Chromatin Signaling and Diseases
AN  - 2148316171
AB  - Chromatin Signaling and Diseases covers the molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression, which govern everything from embryonic development, growth, and human pathologies associated with aging, such as cancer. This book helps researchers learn about or keep up with the quickly expanding field of chromatin signaling. After reading this book, clinicians will be more capable of explaining the mechanisms of gene expression regulation to their patients to reassure them about new drug developments that target chromatin signaling mechanisms. For example, several epigenetic drugs that act on chromatin signaling factors are in clinical trials or even approved for usage in cancer treatments, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases. Other epigenetic drugs are in development to regulate various class of chromatin signaling factors. To keep up with this changing landscape, clinicians and doctors will need to stay familiar with genetic advances that translate to clinical practice, such as chromatin signaling. Although sequencing of the human genome was completed over a decade ago and its structure investigated for nearly half a century, molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression remain largely misunderstood. An emerging concept called chromatin signaling proposes that small protein domains recognize chemical modifications on the genome scaffolding histone proteins, facilitating the nucleation of enzymatic complexes at specific loci that then open up or shut down the access to genetic information, thereby regulating gene expression. The addition and removal of chemical modifications on histones, as well as the proteins that specifically recognize these, is reviewed in Chromatin Signaling and Diseases. Finally, the impact of gene expression defects associated with malfunctioning chromatin signaling is also explored. Explains molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression, which governs everything from embryonic development, growth, and human pathologies associated with aging Educates clinicians and researchers about chromatin signaling, a molecular mechanism that is changing our understanding of human pathology Explores the addition and removal of chemical modifications on histones, the proteins that specifically recognize these, and the impact of gene expression defects associated with malfunctioning chromatin signaling Helps researchers learn about the quickly expanding field of chromatin signaling

T1  - Conservation authority has 20 invaders on hit list: Multipronged approach will give priority to environment-sensitive areas such as Dundas Valley
AN  - 1812581215
AB  - Because the conservation authority doesn't "have a great idea" where the unwanted species are, the strategy is creating 50 study plots throughout the city's watershed and tapping an existing creek monitoring program.              "Three or four acres of garlic mustard is pretty hard. We can remove it, but it will take a lot of time," [Lesley McDonell] said in a presentation to the authority's conservation advisory board, which endorsed the strategy.              "If we don't remove the phragmites from the lower Spencer area, the seeds just get in the water and float downstream," McDonell said.

T1  - The Biohistory of Florida
AN  - 2134892844
AB  - Florida has an amazing biohistory. Its fossil record reveals that 8-ton ground sloths, giant beavers, and tiny horses once roamed its 66,000 square miles. Its human history is the story of people who arrived some 12,000 years ago after a journey that took them from Asia across the Bering land bridge and then south across the North American continent. Today, Florida is home to historic St. Augustine, the futuristic Kennedy Space Center, and the mysterious Everglades. Hosting a diverse ecology and a rich human history, Florida now faces a tenuous future as its natural resources are depleted, new species of plants, animals and diseases invade, and climate changes loom. This fascinating biohistory, prehistoric to present-day, and with an eye to the future, is told with verve and clarity. The result is a fascinating story of how they all interrelate.

T1  - Shellfish-Sniffing Dogs Track Invaders; Ice fishing season coming to a close as March provides us with confusion
AN  - 1775580481
AB  - Earle Greenwood, my late father-in-law, loved Saskatchewan, but really had no use for being here in March.  Since the fishing season closes at month's end, it is important to go ice fishing before you have to wait for open water.  Speaking to fishermen on Vancouver Island's west coast near Tofino I learned that seals are reducing the numbers of many marine creatures.  Besides salmon, mussels, sea urchins and crabs are also targeted by seals.

T1  - Humanity in a Creative Universe
AN  - 2134797384
AB  - In the hard sciences, which can often feel out of grasp for many lay readers, there are "great thinkers" who go far beyond the equations, formulas, and research. Minds such as Stephen Hawking philosophize about the functions and nature of the universe, the implications of our existence, and other impossibly fascinating, yet difficult questions. Stuart A. Kauffman is one of those great thinkers. He has dedicated his lifetime to researching "complex systems" at prestigious institutions and now writes his treatise on the most complex system of all: our universe.A recent Scientific American article claims that "philosophy begins where physics ends, and physics begins where philosophy ends," and perhaps no better quote sums up what Kauffman's latest book offers. Grounded in his rigorous training and research background, Kauffman is inter-disciplinary in every sense of the word, sorting through the major questions and theories in biology, physics, and philosophy. Best known for his philosophy of evolutionary biology, Kauffman coined the term "prestatability" to call into question whether science can ever accurately and precisely predict the future development of biological features in organisms. As evidenced by the title's mention of creativity, the book refreshingly argues that our preoccupation to explain all things with scientific law has deadened our creative natures. In this fascinating read, Kauffman concludes that the development of life on earth is not entirely predictable, because no theory could ever fully account for the limitless variations of evolution. Sure to cause a stir, this book will be discussed for years to come and may even set the tone for the next "great thinker."

T1  - Developmental Psychopathology, Developmental Neuroscience
AN  - 2135174590
AB  - Dante Cicchetti, Ph.D., is McKnight Presidential Chair of Child Psychology in the Institute of Child Development and in the Department of Psychiatry, University of Minnesota. He also is Professor of Psychology at the University of Minnesota. From 1985 to 2005, he directed the Mt. Hope Family Center at the University of Rochester. His research interests lie in the formulation of an integrative developmental theory that can account for both normal and abnormal forms of ontogenesis. His work has several foci: 1) developmental psychopathology; 2) the developmental consequences of child maltreatment; 3) neural plasticity and sensitive periods; 4) the impact of traumatic experiences upon brain development; 5) the biology and psychology of unipolar and bipolar depressive diseases; 6) the interrelationships among molecular genetic, neurobiological, socio-emotional, cognitive, linguistic and representational development in normal and pathological populations; and 7) the study of attachment relations and representational models of the self and its disorders across the life span. Cicchetti has published hundreds of articles, books, and journals that have had far-reaching impact on developmental theory as well as science, policy, and practice related to child maltreatment, depression, mental retardation, and numerous other domains of development.

T1  - Conceptual and Interactive Embodiment:&nbsp;Foundations of Embodied Cognition Volume 2
AN  - 2148188478
AB  - This two-volume set provides a comprehensive overview of the multidisciplinary field of Embodied Cognition. With contributions from internationally acknowledged researchers from a variety of fields, Foundations of Embodied Cognition reveals how intelligent behaviour emerges from the interplay between brain, body and environment. Drawing on the most recent theoretical and empirical findings in embodied cognition, Volume 2 Conceptual and Interactive Embodiment is divided into four distinct parts, bringing together a number of influential perspectives and new ideas. Part one introduces the field of embodied language processing, before part two presents recent developments in our understanding of embodied conceptual understanding. The final two parts look at the applied nature of embodied cognition, exploring the embodied nature of social co-ordination as well as the emerging field of artificial embodiment. Building on the idea that knowledge acquisition, retention and retrieval are intimately interconnected with sensory and motor processes, Foundations of Embodied Cognition is a landmark publication in the field. It will be of great interest to researchers and advanced students from across the cognitive sciences, including those specialising in psychology, neuroscience, intelligent systems and robotics, philosophy, linguistics and anthropology.

T1  - Decline of the Animal Kingdom
AN  - 2134131817
AB  - Decline of the Animal Kingdom investigates modern constructs of domesticity, freedom, wilderness, and artificiality to paint a portrait of what it means to be human, animal, or both in a society saturated with dog boutiques, trophy hunting, retro taxidermy, and eco-tourism. With brief forays into Algonquin Park and the heart of the 1980s jungle, the book largely draws its energy from the urban landscape, where the animals that interact with the environment have permanent effects on the land and human psyche. A wild deer wanders into the downtown core; the Galapagos and the ethics of conservation invade our Xbox; a mule grows weary of his unrewarding office job and unfulfilling relationships. Exploring the victories and defeats of an urban existence complete with 9-5 office angst, the claustrophobia of domestic partnerships in bachelor apartments, and party-and-pick-up culture, Decline of the Animal Kingdom is Laura Clarke’s love letter to the city of Toronto, and to extinct animals and office misfits alike.

T1  - Origins:&nbsp;The Scientific Story of Creation
AN  - 2260011712
AB  - What is life? Where do we come from and how did we evolve? What is the universe and how was it formed? What is the nature of the material world? How does it work? How and why do we think? What does it mean to be human? How do we know?There are many different versions of our creation story. This book tells the version according to modern science. It is a unique account, starting at the Big Bang and travelling right up to the emergence of humans as conscious intelligent beings, 13.8 billion years later. Chapter by chapter, it sets out the current state of scientific knowledge: the origins of space and time; energy, mass, and light; galaxies, stars, and our sun; the habitable earth, and complex life itself. Drawing togetherthe physical and biological sciences, Baggott recounts what we currently know of our history, highlighting the questions science has yet to answer.

T1  - Ionic Liquid-Based Surfactant Science:&nbsp;Formulation, Characterization, and Applications
AN  - 2131246731
AB  - One-step reference on the state of the art of surfactant self-assemblies in ionic liquids through the contributions of world-class authorities on both ILs and surfactant self-assemblies 
The research field of ionic liquids (ILs), which are salts with a melting point below 100 0C, began in 1914 with an observation of which Paul Walden studied, on room temperature liquid salt, ethylammonium nitrate (EAN). While it did not garner significant attention then, literatures on IL studies are rapidly growing. ILs are frequently termed "green solvents" or "designer solvents", because of their unique and attractive physicochemical properties. They are being considered as future solvents for catalysis, chemical reactions, extractions, electrochemical purposes and many other potential applications. 
Attesting to its prominence in colloid and surface chemistry, as well as in the developing areas of modern physical chemistry, technology and engineering, 
Ionic Liquid-Based Surfactant Science: Formulation, Characterization and Applications covers a diversity of current research and applications of the field. This monograph will: 
~Emphasizes the synthesis of ILs of different types, and stabilization of amphiphilic self-assemblies in conventional and newly developed ILs to reveal formulation, physicochemical properties, microstructures, internal dynamics, and thermodynamics 
~Comprehensively presents the topics of ionic liquid assisted micelles and microemulsions in relation to their fundamental characteristics and theories 
~Covers the development of bio-ionic liquids or greener, environment-friendly solvents 
~Includes discussion of applications of ionic liquid based micelles and micremulsions 
Promising and fascinating, ionic liquids are displaying power in many applications pertaining to biotechnologies, environmental sciences, and more to chemistry-related fields. This is an invaluable reference source for chemists, physicists, biologists, chemical engineers, biotechnologists and other experts in different disciplines, both academic and industrial, as well as for undergraduate, post-graduate and Ph. D students to aid their research into a very large and rapid evolving field.

The editor of this book has gathered together pioneers in the field of epigenetics to produce a volume of thought-provoking discussions on classic aspects of epigenetics and on the newer, emerging areas. The 17 chapters include topics on the impact of metabolism on the epigenome, how our actions may impact the health of our offspring several generations removed, and how exposure to environmental toxicants can have long-lasting effects on our epigenome with devastating consequences. This up-to-date volume is a major resource essential for those working in the field and is recommended reading for anyone new to this fascinating and fast-moving area of research.

T1  - Handbook of Medieval Culture. Volume 1
AN  - 2131737744
AB  - A follow-up publication to the Handbook of Medieval Studies, this new reference work turns to a different focus: medieval culture. 
Medieval research has grown tremendously in depth and breadth over the last decades. Particularly our understanding of medieval culture, of the basic living conditions, and the specific value system prevalent at that time has considerably expanded, to a point where we are in danger of no longer seeing the proverbial forest for the trees. The present, innovative handbook offers compact articles on essential topics, ideals, specific knowledge, and concepts defining the medieval world as comprehensively as possible. The topics covered in this new handbook pertain to issues such as love and marriage, belief in God, hell, and the devil, education, lordship and servitude, Christianity versus Judaism and Islam, health, medicine, the rural world, the rise of the urban class, travel, roads and bridges, entertainment, games, and sport activities, numbers, measuring, the education system, the papacy, saints, the senses, death, and money.

T1  - Science, Technology, and New Challenges to Ocean Law
AN  - 2135446551
AB  - Science, Technology, and New Challenges to Ocean Law offers fresh perspectives on a set of vital issues in the field of ocean law and policy. Since the early period of the industrial revolution, successive waves of revolutionary scientific discoveries and technological innovations have intensified the global population's exploitation of ocean and coastal resources. In this volume, several leading authorities in the field address major dimensions of the interface of science, technology and ocean law--both historically and in current-day perspective--and emergent challenges in legal ordering of ocean uses for sustainability and equitability. Among the topics that are analysed in these readable, accessible papers are ecosystem approaches to resource management, the historic interplay of science and military concerns, the place of science in dispute-settlement processes, the varied human uses of the seabed, the roles in ocean governance of indigenous peoples, legal issues in fisheries management and conservation, and special regional problems of the Arctic, the Bering Strait, the South China Sea, and the eastern Mediterranean. The urgent importance of the subjects addressed here, together with the variety of disciplinary approaches deployed by the authors, enhance the value of this book's unique contribution to the literature of ocean studies.

AN  - 2133312770
AB  - The internet is a powerful beast when it comes to science; the answer to any query you may have is just a few keystrokes away. But when there are multiple answers from various sources, how do we know what information is reliable? In Monkeys, Myths, and Molecules, bestselling author Dr. Joe Schwarcz takes a critical look at how facts are misconstrued in the media. He debunks the myths surrounding canned food, artificial dyes, SPF, homeopathy, cancer, chemicals, and much more. Unafraid to expose the sheer nonsense people are led to believe about health, food, drugs, and our environment, Dr. Joe confronts pseudoscience and convincingly and entertainingly advocates for a scientific approach to everyday life.

T1  - Phytotherapies:&nbsp;Efficacy, Safety, and Regulation
AN  - 2131349991
AB  - Variously defined by its practitioners, phytotherapies include herbal therapies, treatments used by indigenous peoples around the world, and alternative medicines to classical western drugs. Despite an increasing trend toward the use of phytotherapies for chemoprevention and management of disease in healthcare, the published work about their efficacy and safety is scattered - and scientists need to understand these key issues along with regulatory aspects of phytotherpeutic agents. A number of herbs are likely to cause adverse effects if not properly standardized in clinical trials. 
Covering fundamentals and new developments in phytotherapy, this book combines pharmaceutical sciences and chemistry - including herbal medicine clinical trials, specific applications of phytomedicine, successful case studies, and international regulatory perspectives that are essential for research and development of phytotherapeutics. 
The book discusses a wide range of topics and focuses on the clinical aspect of phytotherapeutic agents. It describes the major groups of phytotherapeutics, scientific and pharmacological basis for efficacy, active components and ingredients, the metabolism and interactions of these drugs, and future perspectives on phytotherapeutics. In addition, chapters deal with international regulatory aspects and crucial topics for proper clinical trials - analytical challenges for quality control, examples of clinical trials, and drug delivery and formulation issues. Specific types of regional phytomedicines feature alongside those used for different applications like cellular drug targets or chemoprevention. Chapters also deal with phytotherapies for major diseases like cancer, liver disorders, inflammation, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. 
In offering such a thorough collection of information on phytotherapies, this unique book helps practicing scientists and medical and pharmaceutical science researchers understand the fundamentals and most effective application of phytotherapeutic agents.

AN  - 2130855942
AB  - This monograph reviews all relevant technologies based on mass spectrometry that are used to study or screen biological interactions in general. Different distinct areas for analysis of bioaffinity interactions can be recognized in this regard. These areas include pre-column based ligand trapping followed by MS analysis, affinity chromatography following MS and post column on-line affinity profiling. Other methodologies relate to separately performed bioassays and (LC) MS analysis. Besides these, direct approaches are nowadays also used in several research areas and include direct MS based bioassays and native MS studies in which the latter looks at intact protein complexes in the gas phase.This monograph reviews all relevant technologies based on mass spectrometry that are used to study or screen biological interactions in general.

T1  - Politics of Urban Water:&nbsp;Changing Waterscapes in Amsterdam
AN  - 2132057304
AB  - Fifty years ago, urban waterfronts were industrial, polluted, and diseased. Today, luxury homes and shops line riverbanks, harbors, and lakes across Europe and North America. The visual drama of physical reconstruction makes this transition look swift and decisive, but reimaging water is a slow process, punctuated by small cultural shifts and informal spatial seizures that change the meaning of wet urban spaces. In 
The Politics of Urban Water, Kimberley Kinder explores how active residents in Amsterdam deployed their cityscape when rallying around these concerns, turning space into a vehicle for social reform.
 While market dynamics certainly contributed to the transformation of Amsterdam’s shorelines, squatters, partiers, artists, historians, environmentalists, tourists, reporters, and government officials also played crucial roles in bringing waterscapes to life. Their interventions pulled water in new directions, connecting it to political discussions about affordable housing, cultural tolerance, climate change, and national identity. Over time, these political valences have become embedded in laws, norms, symbols, markets, and landscapes, bringing rich undercurrents of friction to urban shores. Amsterdam’s development serves as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale for cities across Europe and North America where rapid new growth creates similar pressures and anxieties.

T1  - The Origin of Chronic Inflammatory Systemic Diseases and Their Sequelae
AN  - 2141130290
AB  - Chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and others typically stimulate a systemic response of the entire body. This response has a uniform character in many diseases because common pathways are switched on. The uniform response regulates systemic energy and water provision. However, long-term application of this program leads to typical disease sequelae such as fatigue / depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, anorexia, malnutrition, muscle wasting cachexia, cachectic obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, alterations of steroid hormone axes, disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, elevated sympathetic tone, hypertension, volume expansion, decreased parasympathetic tone, inflammation related anemia, bone loss, hypercoagulability, circadian rhythms of symptoms, and disease exacerbation by stress ." " "The Origin of Chronic Inflammatory Systemic Diseases" "and Their Sequelae "demonstrates concepts of neuroendocrine immunology, energy and water regulation, and evolutionary medicine in order to show that the uniform response that regulates systemic energy and water provision, has been positively selected for acute physiological responses and short-lived disease states, but is a misguided program in chronic inflammatory diseases and aging. * Offers a broad conceptual framework with a strong clinical link, written in an easy to grasp style and demonstrating the link to aging research * Describes the important principles derived from basic immunology that are used to explain pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory systemic diseases with a focus on autoimmunity * Defines the bioenergetics and energy regulation of the body explaining common response pathways typical for systemic inflammation * Makes use of evolutionary medicine theory to demonstrate the uniformity of the systemic response * Explains the appearance of typical disease sequelae on the basis of the three pillars: neuroendocrine immunology, energy regulation, and evolutionary medicine theory * Contains color figures and tables that explain the field to newcomers"

T1  - Practising proper catch-and-release crucial
AN  - 1669535363
AB  - For those who fish for muskie, correct release of fish is a way of life. Ben Beattie is a fishing guide and outdoor writer living in Sioux Lookout, in northwestern Ontario's Sunset Country. Originally from southern Ontario, Ben has a degree in environmental studies from the University of Waterloo. His love of fishing and hunting brought him to Sioux Lookout, where he has guided for the last 12 years.              Muskie is his No. 1 passion, and he works hard to make sure these trophy fish are released properly, through correct handling and with minimal stress. Beattie says hanging them vertically without support is not acceptable anymore, especially when using a scale or jaw grabber. Large pike and muskie are extremely susceptible to delayed mortality when handled this way.              We then decided to move east towards the main island and shallower water. I knew we were on the right track when longtime guide Lee Nolden stopped by to chat. There probably isn't anybody who sport fishes Lake Winnipeg that knows more about the fishery than Lee.

T1  - Year in Review: Looking back at the headlines of 2014
AN  - 1643089729
AB  - On Saturday, Feb. 22, a 21-year-old Sicamous man was arrested after police received a report of threats. Sicamous RCMP Sgt. Dave Dubnyk said officers acted immediately and the arrest was made the same day.

              
The Sicamous Chamber of Commerce and visitor information centre, the Sicamous Museum and Historical Society, artists and local First Nations may one day work and thrive together in the same facility if Kim Hyde has her way. Hyde is working with the chamber to find and secure grant opportunities that will allow for the purchase of the former, 2.34-acre Tru Hardware property at the corner of Main Street and Highway 97A.

              
A collaborative approach may be the way to entice physicians to locate in rural Shuswap communities. This approach was on display in Penticton at the Rural Emergency continuum of Care conference, where a contingent from the Shuswap, represented by the Shuswap Healthy Communities coalition, was attempting to sell the region and its rural communities  Sicamous, Chase, Sorrento and others  to doctors.

T1  - Leishmania:&nbsp;Current Biology and Control
AN  - 2295244925
AB  - With an estimated 1.3 million new cases and causing more than 20,000 deaths every year, Leishmaniasis continues to be a menace in countries across the globe. The absence of an anti-Leishmania vaccine, the toxicity of current anti-parasite drugs, coupled with the rapid emergence of drug resistant Leishmania strains remain significant challenges for disease control. This has spurred a plethora of research initiatives into the parasite biology, parasite-host interaction, mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, drug development and molecular mechanism of drug resistance. Insights obtained from various such studies are essential for the development of novel anti-Leishmania treatment strategies. In this timely book respected Leismania experts distil the important current research highlighting the most insightful discoveries in the field. Topics covered include: modulation of host miRNA; heat shock proteins; Iron in the Leishmania-macrophage interaction; oxidative and nitrosative stress response; cell death; strategies for immune evasion; STAT signalling; parasite modulation of toll-like receptors in macrophages; T cells in Leishmania infection; vaccine biology; inhibitors of Leishmania DNA topoisomerases; and mechanism of drug resistance in visceral Leishmaniasis. An essential text for everyone in the Leishmania community and recommended for researchers working in related fields.

T1  - Rosenberg's Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurological and Psychiatric Disease
AN  - 2132012843
AB  - Rosenberg's Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurologic and Psychiatric Disease, Fifth Edition provides a comprehensive introduction and reference to the foundations and key practical aspects relevant to the majority of neurologic and psychiatric disease. A favorite of over three generations of students, clinicians and scholars, this new edition retains and expands the informative, concise and critical tone of the first edition. This is an essential reference for general medical practitioners, neurologists, psychiatrists, geneticists, and related professionals, and for the neuroscience and neurology research community. The content covers all aspects essential to the practice of neurogenetics to inform clinical diagnosis, treatment and genetic counseling. Every chapter has been thoroughly revised or newly commissioned to reflect the latest scientific and medical advances by an international team of leading scientists and clinicians. The contents have been expanded to include disorders for which a genetic basis has been recently identified, together with abundant original illustrations that convey and clarify the key points of the text in an attractive, didactic format. 
Previous editions have established this book as the leading tutorial reference on neurogenetics. Researchers will find great value in the coverage of genomics, animal models and diagnostic methods along with a better understanding of the clinical implications. Clinicians will rely on the coverage of the basic science of neurogenetics and the methods for evaluating patients with biochemical abnormalities or gene mutations, including links to genetic testing for specific diseases.
A complete introduction and reference on the neurogenetics of neurological and psychiatric diseaseRoger N. Rosenberg, MD holds the Abe (Brunky), Morris and William Zale Distinguished Chair and Professor of Neurology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. He served as Chair of the Department of Neurology from 1973- 1991.

 In 2006, he published for the first time that a DNA A ß42 vaccine administered with the gene gun method into the skin of Alzheimer disease model mice can reduce Aß42 peptide levels in the brain by 50% with anti-A ß42 antibody of the IgG1/Th2 type which is known to be anti-inflammatory. He received in 2009 a US Patent as Inventor of "Amyloid ß Gene Vaccines". This DNA vaccine has the potential to be a safe and effective therapy to prevent Alzheimer disease.
 He described Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), an autosomal dominant ataxia, with William Nyhan, M.D. Ph.D, in 1976, for the first time. MJD is now the most common autosomal domiant spinocerebellar ataxia world-wide.
 Dr. Rosenberg has published over 270 original scientific papers, chapters, reviews and editorials. He is the founding editor and senior editor since 1993 for all five editions of "The Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurological and Psychiatric Diseases".
 
 Juan M. Pascual is the inaugural holder of The Once Upon a Time Foundation Professorship in Pediatric Neurologic Diseases. He is a tenured faculty member in the Departments of Neurology and Neurotherapeutics, Physiology and Pediatrics and in the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth & Development / Center for Human Genetics and is Director of the Rare Brain Disorders Program (Clinic and Laboratory). He is also a member of the Division of Pediatric Neurology, of the graduate Ph.D. programs in Neuroscience and Integrative Biology, and of the postgraduate clinical training programs in Neurology, Pediatric Neurology, Pediatrics and Medical Genetics. He also teaches at the UT Southwestern Medical School. Dr. Pascual directs a highly collaborative research laboratory and is credentialed at Children''s Medical Center Dallas, UT Southwestern University Hospitals and Clinics and Parkland Memorial Hospital, where he consults on inpatients and outpatients with particularly complex or severe diseases. Much of his research is funded by the National Institutes of Health. He received certification in Neurology with Special Qualification in Child Neurology from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. As one of few actively practicing pediatric neurologists in the U.S. who is also a laboratory scientist, Dr. Pascual is interested in the molecular mechanisms that cause inherited metabolic and excitability disorders using electrophysiology and nuclear magnetic resonance both in human subjects and in models of human diseases. His laboratory is located in the newest biomedical research building at UT Southwestern and is an integral part of the Department of Neurology and Neurotherapeutics. The laboratory is home to scientists from very broad backgrounds and levels of training and expertise who have joined efforts to endow both pediatric neurology and human developmental neuroscience with a strong scientific basis. As a clinician, Dr. Pascual specializes in genetic and metabolic diseases of the nervous and neuromuscular systems of infants, children and adults with a particular emphasis on complex diagnostic problems, second opinions for patients visiting from the rest of the U.S. and abroad, and in clinical trials. Dr. Pascual has special clinical research expertise in rare diseases, glucose metabolism, mitochondrial, degenerative, and multi-organ disorders. Dr. Pascual has co-authored over two dozen scientific, medical and philosophical textbooks. He is the editor, together with Dr. Roger Rosenberg of Rosenberg''s Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurological and Psychiatric Disease (5th edition, Academic Press, forthcoming). He is now writing a new textbook on Progressive and Degenerative Brain Disorders in Children.

AN  - 2135366405
AB  - Von der antiken sumerischen Töpferkunst zur Glasmalerei Tiffanys, angewandte Kunst bildete über Generationen hinweg einen wichtigen Teil der menschlichen Erfahrungswelt. Während die bildenden Künste in Museen und Galerien bewundert werden, ist die angewandte Kunst die Kunst des Alltäglichen, indem sie in Form von Gebrauchsgegenständen, die von prosaisch bis fantastisch reichen, Schönheit mit Funktionalität verbindet. Albert Jacquemart feiert in diesem Text die Schönheit und das künstlerische Potenzial in den alltäglichsten Gegenständen. Der Leser wird darin seine Wertschätzung der geschickten Kunstfertigkeit des produzierenden Gewerbes neu entdecken.

AN  - 2134423456
AB  - From ancient Sumerian pottery to Tiffany stained glass, decorative art has been a fundamental part of the human experience for generations. While fine art is confined to galleries and museums, decorative art is the art of the every day, combining beauty with functionality in objects ranging from the prosaic to the fantastical. In this work, Albert Jacquemart celebrates the beauty and artistic potential behind even the most quotidian object. Readers will walk away from this text with a newfound appreciation for the subtle artistry of the manufactured world.

AN  - 1622032775
AB  - It's not surprising that the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters was supportive of this proposed policy push. After all, among the most hyped threats posed by an invasive species is that linked to types of Asian carp that have caused ruinous impact for sports fishing and related tourism in certain U.S. watersheds. With the encroachment of such fish in waters closer to Ontario, responding to this concern has spurred considerable lobbying and anxiety.

T1  - The fieldman's files - Those pests to deal with, other than the fieldman
AN  - 1612769290
AB  - Really hasn't seen much change since I started down this path back in 1986. The responsibilities of landowners are, in my opinion, nigh impossible to achieve. I'll paraphrase the Act, Section 5, which outlines the duty of an individual for pests and nuisances: "An owner or occupant of land or property shall take active measures to prevent the establishment of pests, control or destroy all pests on their property (not just land) and destroy any crop that contributes or may contribute to the maintenance or spread of a pest."

              
last year about our blackleg findings, the response from many was, 'So what? I still pulled off a 50 bu/ac crop. So finding blackleg is not a big deal, right?' In my opinion, we are courting disaster, big time, with our shortened rotations. Certainly, right now, blackleg doesn't appear to be hurting yields much if at all.

              
blackleg has a fantastic ability to cross and create new strains. It has the potential to morph from a virulent blackleg that is kept in check by our resistant varieties, to one which overcomes resistance, putting us back to the late 80's when blackleg nearly wiped out our canola industry, and everyone wore leg warmers. Canola growers are getting a wakeup call in the clubroot hot spots of the province, where clubroot resistance has broken down in some fields.

AB  - MIDLAND - Midland's inaugural watercross event "undoubtedly stirred up" Little Lake's waters, but another event is already in the works for next year, according to a report.

              
"The watercross event undoubtedly stirred up the nearshore waters of Little Lake along the beach," the report read.

              
The lake's water quality was back to normal and "acceptable for swimming" by the Monday following the July 26 event, the report read.

T1  - Battarbee and Namatjira:&nbsp;Rex Battarbee and Albert Namatjira
AN  - 2130972293
AB  - Battarbee and Namatjira is the double biography of artists Rex Battarbee and Albert Namatjira, one white Australian from Warrnambool in Victoria, the other Aboriginal, of the Arrernte people, from the Hermannsburg Mission west of Alice Springs. From their first encounters in the early 1930s, when Battarbee introduced Namatjira to the techniques of watercolour painting, through the period of Namatjiras extraordinary popularity as a painter, to his tragic death in 1959, their close relationship was to have a decisive impact on Australian art. This double biography makes extensive use of Battarbees diaries for the first time, to throw new light on Namatjiras life, and to bring Battarbee, who has been largely ignored by biographers, back into focus. Moving between the artists and their backgrounds, Edmond portrays the personal and social difficulties the two men faced, while at the same time illuminating large cultural themes - the traditions and legacies of the Arrernte, the influence of the Lutheran church, the development of anthropology and the evolution of Australian art. A book full of startling insights. Might colour be the foundation of Arrernte philosophy? Might we understand each other, Arrernte style, in the same way we understand a colour - as a vividness that registers and enriches only in relation to the colours glowing nearby? For this seems to be the way these two vivid men - Battarbee and Namatjira - cast their peculiar hues. Each a catalyst and a primer for the other, each shimmering alongside the other. Ross Gibson Critical responses to Martin Edmonds writing: Luca Antara is a book-lovers book, a graceful and mesmerising blend of history, autobiography, travel and romance. JM Coetzee He is constantly demonstrating that the natural world is as splendiferous as any fable. Its in those moments...that we feel the affecting complexity of his presence, asserted triumphantly. New York Times rich in ideas, at once erudite and eclectic, and full of beautifully unexpected and evocative descriptions. Canberra Times

T1  - The Golden Peaches of Samarkand:&nbsp;A Study of T’ang Exotics
AN  - 2135096153
AB  - In the seventh century the kingdom of Samarkand sent formal gifts of fancy yellow peaches, large as goose eggs and with a color like gold, to the Chinese court at Ch’ang-an. What kind of fruit these golden peaches really were cannot now be guessed, but they have the glamour of mystery, and they symbolize all the exotic things longed for, and unknown things hoped for, by the people of the T’ang empire. This book examines the exotics imported into China during the T’ang Dynasty (A.D. 618-907), and depicts their influence on Chinese life. Into the land during the three centuries of T’ang came the natives of almost every nation of Asia, all bringing exotic wares either as gifts or as goods to be sold. Ivory, rare woods, drugs, diamonds, magicians, dancing girls—the author covers all classes of unusual imports, their places of origin, their lore, their effect on costume, dwellings, diet, and on painting, sculpture, music, and poetry. This book is not a statistical record of commercial imports and medieval trade, but rather a “humanistic essay, however material its subject matter.” “The most essential thing the reviewer can say about this book is, ‘Read it!’ It is probably the most informative, most scholarly, and most delightfully written book on China that has appeared in our time. It is a heartening reminder that scholars still have an interest in studying history in terms of people, in examining people’s intimate reactions to the little human things that occupied their daily lives.”—Jour. of Asian Studies “A pure delight....Scarcely any aspect of T’ang life is omitted, so that bit by bit Mr. Schafer builds up a reasonably complete picture of an entire civilization. Mr· Schafer writes with urbanity and wit.”—Sat. Rev. “A fascinating survey of T’ang culture as reflected in the use and demand for exotica....Rarely has the reviewer come upon a book so enjoyable and informative·”—Jour. of the American Oriental Society.

AN  - 2135900300
AB  - Wrestling with Words and Meanings honors the life and career of Professor Keith Allan, commemorating at the same time the occasion of his 70th birthday. The book brings together top-level researchers in linguistics - colleagues, collaborators, and former students - who have all been inspired by Allan's work in some way. These appropriately eclectic contributions are organized into the three main themes that run through Allan's multifaceted and multifarious research: word meaning, pragmatics and discourse, and semantic theory and philosophy of language. The festschrift offers glimpses into corpus linguistics, cognitive linguistics, and cultural linguistics, as well as the more traditional descriptive, diachronic, and typological perspectives. It is an outstanding collection in honor of an outstanding researcher. (Series: Linguistics)

AB  - Grade 11 students Kyla Kohlman and Shelby Stang briefly broke their silence on March 17 to talk to the Mirror about a silent protest that members of Macklin School's Student Representative Council took part in. "We Are Silent is a peaceful protest to stand up for injustices," said Kohlman. "It's a protest started by an organization called Free The Children. Our SRC does activities and comes up with the campaigns. This is a silent protest and we use social media to let people know about it." -MACKLIN MIRROR

AN  - 2140961073
AB  - Contributions from neuroscientists, climate commentators, psychologists, and science journalists share the billing with pieces from comedians, novelists, and poets in this collection of the best science writing in Australia.

What does science have to say about the sex in Fifty Shades of Grey? Is giving up meat really the greenest option? Do birds make art? and Can a psychologist interpret farts? With a foreword by comedian, musician, and self-confessed science nerd Tim Minchin, this provocative collection is brimming with intrigue, curiosity, and controversy.

T1  - Trends and Traditions in Southeastern Zooarchaeology
AN  - 2132092144
AB  - While most works of southeastern archaeology focus on stone artifacts or ceramics, this volume is the first to bring together past and current trends in zooarchaeological studies. Faunal reports are often relegated to appendices and not synthesized with the rest of the archaeological data, but 
Trends and Traditions in Southeastern Zooarchaeology calls attention to the diversity of information that faunal remains can reveal about rituals, ideologies, socio-economic organization, trade, and past environments. 
These essays, by leading practitioners in this developing field, highlight the differences between the archaeological focus on animals as the food source of their time and the belief among zooarchaeologists that animals represent a far more complex ecology. With broad methodological and interpretive analysis of sites throughout the region, the essays range in topic from the enduring symbolism of shells for more than 5,000 years to the domesticated dog cemeteries of Spirit Hill in Jackson County, Alabama, and to the subsistence strategies of Confederate soldiers at the Florence Stockade in South Carolina. 
Ultimately challenging traditional concepts of the roles animals have played in the social and economic development of southeastern cultures, this book is a groundbreaking and seminal archaeological study.

T1  - Collected Stories
AN  - 2141062352
AB  - Maurice Duggan's Collected Stories is a powerful collection of short stories from one of New Zealand's finest writers of the genre. Duggan's lyrical power and exceptional style come to the fore in these brilliant stories, which are tinged with undercurrents and ambivalences. The variety of language gives great vitality to tales of a Catholic boyhood, troubled marriage, loneliness, small town ambitions and sexuality. Maurice Duggan destroyed his unpublished fiction, so Collected Stories represents virtually all of his remaining works. The critic, poet and novelist C. K. Stead has compiled and edited this collection, in addition to providing an introduction and in-depth biographical information. Stead describes the stories in this volume as 'some of the most perfect short fictions written by a New Zealander'.

T1  - Buildings Cities Life:&nbsp;An Autobiography in Architecture, Volume 1
AN  - 2134291307
AB  - The personal story and philosophy of one of the world's most famous urban architects is vividly presented in words and pictures. Discover the life, architecture, and philosophy of Eberhard Heinrich Zeidler, starting with his early life, his studies at the Bauhaus, and his reasons for leaving Germany. In his early days in Peterborough, Ontario, he became a partner of Blackwell and Craig and created homes, schools, hospitals, and the Peterborough Memorial Centre. After moving to Toronto, Zeidler designed the McMaster Health Sciences Centre, which started a new direction in healthcare buildings and attracted thousands of visiting architects. Many hospitals of this type followed, and architects all over the world appropriated Zeidler's philosophy. His design of the Eaton Centre succeeded in stimulating Toronto's dying downtown, bringing new life to it. Zeidler married Jane Abbott, lived on a farm, and had three children, two girls and one boy. A third daughter was born, and he renovated an old house in one of Toronto's ravines to raise his family. Projects all over the world followed, including ones in England, Germany, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria, West Palm Beach, Beijing, Shanghai, and Dubai.

T1  - Neurobiology of Mental Illness
AN  - 2133304992
AB  - Our understanding of the neurobiological basis of psychiatric disease has accelerated in the past five years. The fourth edition of Neurobiology of Mental Illness has been completely revamped given these advances and discoveries on the neurobiologic foundations of psychiatry. Like its predecessors the book begins with an overview of the basic science. The emerging technologies in Section 2 have been extensively redone to match the progress in the field including new chapters on the applications of stem cells, optogenetics, and image guided stimulation to our understanding and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Sections' 3 through 8 pertain to the major psychiatric syndromes-the psychoses, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, dementias, and disorders of childhood-onset. Each of these sections includes our knowledge of their etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. The final section discusses special topic areas including the neurobiology of sleep, resilience, social attachment, aggression, personality disorders and eating disorders. In all, there are 32 new chapters in this volume including unique insights on DSM-5, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) from NIMH, and a perspective on the continuing challenges of diagnosis given what we know of the brain and the mechanisms pertaining to mental illness. This book provides information from numerous levels of analysis including molecular biology and genetics, cellular physiology, neuroanatomy, neuropharmacology, epidemiology, and behavior. In doing so it translates information from the basic laboratory to the clinical laboratory and finally to clinical treatment. No other book distills the basic science and underpinnings of mental disorders and explains the clinical significance to the scope and breadth of this classic text. The result is an excellent and cutting-edge resource for psychiatric residents, psychiatric researchers, doctoral students, and postdoctoral fellows the neurosciences.

T1  - CDC Health Information for International Travel 2014:&nbsp;The Yellow Book
AN  - 2135666474
AB  - Health risks are real and ever-changing, especially while traveling abroad. To stay abreast of the most up-to-date health recommendations, experienced travelers and health care professionals have always relied on CDC's user-friendly Health Information for International Travel (commonly known as the The Yellow Book) as their one indispensable guide. Updated biennially by a team of almost two hundred experts-including both CDC staff and travel medicine experts--this book is the only publication that contains all of the official government recommendations for international travel. Clearly written and featuring full-color illustrations, the book provides easy-to-read disease risk maps, information on where to find health care during travel, advice for those traveling with infants and children, a comprehensive catalog of diseases, and detailed country-specific health warnings. For example, the section on the Caribbean lays out the recommended immunizations and examines specific health risks for travelers to the region, ranging from malaria to dengue, yellow fever, and traveler's diarrhea. But the book goes beyond the risk of disease to discuss dangers such as violent crime-fortunately, not a great danger to tourists in the area-and also to remind travelers that the single greatest cause of injury death among visitors are traffic accidents. The section on the Caribbean also notes hurricane season and outlines the risks involved in snorkeling, diving, and other water activities common to the area. Every facet of the previous edition has been revisited and revised where necessary, including country-by-country immunization suggestions and new drug information. For the primary care clinician, the specialized travel medicine clinician, or the avid or first-time international traveler, this book is an indispensable safety net, providing readers with everything they need to know to prevent or to seek treatment for illness abroad.

the morphology and interrelationships between glial cells and neurones in different parts of the nervous systems 
the cellular physiology of the different kinds of glial cells 
the mechanisms of intra- and inter-cellular signalling in glial networks 
the mechanisms of glial-neuronal communications 
the role of glial cells in synaptic plasticity, neuronal survival and development of nervous system 
the cellular and molecular mechanisms of metabolic neuronal-glial interactions 
the role of glia in nervous system pathology, including pathology of glial cells and associated diseases - for example, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Alexander disease and Parkinson's  Neuroglia oversee the birth and development of neurones, the establishment of interneuronal connections (the 'connectome'), the maintenance and removal of these inter-neuronal connections, writing of the nervous system components, adult neurogenesis, the energetics of nervous tissue, metabolism of neurotransmitters, regulation of ion composition of the interstitial space and many, many more homeostatic functions. This book primes the reader towards the notion that nervous tissue is not divided into more important and less important cells. The nervous tissue functions because of the coherent and concerted action of many different cell types, each contributing to an ultimate output. This reaches its zenith in humans, with the creation of thoughts, underlying acquisition of knowledge, its analysis and synthesis, and contemplating the Universe and our place in it.

T1  - The Toxicology of Methanol
AN  - 2131391052
AB  - Examines methanol toxicity in humans, animals, and the environment 
Methanol is a natural product widely used as a chemical intermediate and as a component in a broad range of consumer products. It can also be highly toxic. This book offers a comprehensive review of the toxicity of methanol and its effects on humans, animals, and the environment. Much of the current research on methanol's toxicity involves animal models; however, the author explains how the results of this research can apply to humans. 

The Toxicology of Methanol begins with an introduction to methanol production and markets. It then explores the impact of methanol on the environment, presenting realistic scenarios that demonstrate what can happen when large quantities of methanol are accidentally released into the environment. Next, the book covers: 
 
Human toxicity, including exposure, metabolism, in utero exposure, controlled human studies, and management of methanol poisoning 
Animal and aquatic toxicity, including acute toxicity, irritation, sensitization, and repeat exposures 
Developmental and reproductive toxicology of methanol as well as the pathogenesis of methanol-induced birth defects 
Key differences between PBPK models of methanol disposition in mice and in humans 
Oxidative stress and species differences in the metabolism, developmental toxicity, and carcinogenic potential of methanol and ethanol  
The final chapter is dedicated to methanol and cancer, exploring potential mechanisms such as genotoxicity and oxidative damage. Each chapter in the book ends with conclusions underscoring what we can glean from current research results. Each chapter also includes extensive references leading to the primary literature in the field. 
Reviewing all the latest research studies, 
The Toxicology of Methanol will help toxicologists, industrial hygienists, environmental scientists, and product safety professionals better understand and manage the hazards of methanol toxicity.

T1  - Encyclopedia of the Mind
AN  - 2132940088
AB  - It′s hard to conceive of a topic of more broad and personal interest than the study of the mind. In addition to its traditional investigation by the disciplines of psychology, psychiatry, and neuroscience, the mind has also been a focus of study in the fields of philosophy, economics, anthropology, linguistics, computer science, molecular biology, education, and literature. In all these approaches, there is an almost universal fascination with how the mind works and how it affects our lives and our behavior. Studies of the mind and brain have crossed many exciting thresholds in recent years, and the study of mind now represents a thoroughly cross-disciplinary effort. Researchers from a wide range of disciplines seek answers to such questionsas: What is mind? How does it operate? What is consciousness? 
This encyclopedia brings together scholars from the entire range of mind-related academic disciplines from across the arts and humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and computer science and engineering to explore the multidimensional nature of the human mind.

T1  - Building the U. S. Battery Industry for Electric Drive Vehicles:&nbsp;Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities: Summary of a Symposium
AN  - 2131375551
AB  - Since 1991, the National Research Council, under the auspices of the Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy, has undertaken a program of activities to improve policymakers' understandings of the interconnections of science, technology, and economic policy and their importance for the American economy and its international competitive position. The Board's activities have corresponded with increased policy recognition of the importance of knowledge and technology to economic growth. The goal of the this symposium was to conduct two public symposia to review and analyze the potential contributions of public-private partnerships and identify other relevant issues for the Department of Energy, Office of Vehicle Technologies, Energy Storage Team's activities in the energy storage research and development area. The symposia will also identify lessons from these and other domestic and international experiences to help inform DoE as to whether its activities are complete and appropriately focused. Additional topics that emerge in the course of the planning may also be addressed. Building the U.S. Battery Industry for Electric Drive Vehicles: Summary of a Symposium gathers representatives from leading battery manufacturers, automotive firms, university researchers, academic and industry analysts, congressional staff, and federal agency representatives. An individually-authored summary of each symposium will be issued. 
The symposium was held in Michigan in order to provide direct access to the policymakers and industrial participants drawn from the concentration of battery manufacturers and automotive firms in the region. The symposium reviewed the current state, needs, and challenges of the U.S. advanced battery manufacturing industry; challenges and opportunities in battery R&D, commercialization, and deployment; collaborations between the automotive industry and battery industry; workforce issues, and supply chain development. It also focused on the impact of DoE's investments and the role of state and federal programs in support of this growing industry. This task of this report is to summarize the presentations and discussions that took place at this symposium. Needless to say, the battery industry has evolved very substantially since the conference was held, and indeed some of the caveats raised by the speakers with regard to overall demand for batteries and the prospects of multiple producers now seem prescient. At the same time, it is important to understand that it is unrealistic to expect that all recipients of local, state, or federal support in a complex and rapidly evolving industry will necessarily succeed. A number of the firms discussed here have been absorbed by competitors, others have gone out of business, and others continue to progress.

AB  - -  KAIROS Salmon Arm, the Shuswap Okanagan NDP and the Shuswap Environmental Action Society sponsored a public forum for local residents to learn about the controversial 1,177 kilometer Enbridge Gateway pipeline proposal that will go from the Alberta tar sands to the West Coast Port of Kitimat tar sands. 

              
-  The Shuswap Launch-a-Preneur program, Salmon Arm's own Dragon's Den, concludes at the Salmon Classic this month with Conrad Wilkins of OneKan declared winner and Jennifer Ripel of White-o-Coccoli receiving the Green Initiative Award. 

              
-  Salmon Arm's own Erika Lipsett, as part of  the BC Thunder team, defeated all contenders at the 2012 National Ringette Championship. The team not only won but also made history, as traditionally Edmonton and Cambridge teams have volleyed the winning title back and forth since the championship's inception.

T1  - Capital News review of 2012 (part 1)
AN  - 1243240963
AB  - Both the City of Kelowna and West Kelowna adopted new contracts with the RCMP, despite a last minute wage increase announced federally that was never planned during the negotiations. Kelowna city council also decided to add new members to its RCMP contingent. 

              
Club Penguin co-founder Lane Merrifield was made an honorary fellow by Okanagan College and told graduates he never excelled in school and could not have imagined himself giving a commencement speech like the one he gave at the spring convocation. "Back when I was in school, inventing new ways of doing things was called 'cutting corners,' creating characters and stories was called 'day dreaming,'" he said. 

              
Irish singer Julie Feeney flew into Kelowna to support a fan, Robert Jung of Annegret's Chocolates. She played a benefit concert for the charity of his choice, Project Literacy, and gave a performance in the mall where his wife's chocolate shop is stationed. Jung wrote to her after drawing on her songs as inspiration in his fight to come back from a life-threatening motorcycle accident that took him from being a marathon running to a man who couldn't walk.

T1  - Biochemistry of Foods
AN  - 2132066843
AB  - This bestselling reference bridges the gap between the introductory and highly specialized books dealing with aspects of food biochemistry for undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, and professionals in the fi elds of food science, horticulture, animal science, dairy science and cereal chemistry. 
Now fully revised and updated, with contributing authors from around the world, the third edition of Biochemistry of Foods once again presents the most current science available. The first section addresses the biochemical changes involved in the development of raw foods such as cereals, legumes, fruits and vegetables, milk, and eggs. Section II reviews the processing of foods such as brewing, cheese and yogurt, oilseed processing as well as the role of non-enzymatic browning. Section III on spoilage includes a comprehensive review of enzymatic browning, lipid oxidation and milk off-flavors. The final section covers the new and rapidly expanding area of rDNA technologies. This book provides transitional coverage that moves the reader from concept to application. 

OCo Features new chapters on rDNA technologies, legumes, eggs, oilseed processing and fat modifi cation, and lipid oxidation 
OCo Offers expanded and updated material throughout, including valuable illustrations

T1  - Holme, Ringer and Company:&nbsp;The Rise and Fall of a British Enterprise in Japan, 1868-1940
AN  - 2131986609
AB  - Established in the Nagasaki Foreign Settlement in 1868, Holme, Ringer & Co. led foreign business in western Japan up to the eve of the Second World War, engaging not only in the commodities trade and shipping and insurance agencies, but also trawl fishing and Norwegian-style whaling, hotel management, and the introduction of modern technologies such as waterworks, telephones, mechanised flour milling and large-scale petroleum storage. Gathering information from a wide range of sources, the author provides the first detailed description of these activities in Nagasaki and Shimonoseki while shedding light on the remarkable story of Frederick Ringer and his descendants, a British family that contributed to the development of modern Japan but ultimately found it impossible to stay.

T1  - Frontier Naturalist:&nbsp;Jean Louis Berlandier and the Exploration of Northern Mexico and Texas
AN  - 2131094353
AB  - This is a true story of discovery and discoverers in what was the northern frontier region of Mexico in the years before the Mexican War. In 1826, when the story begins, the region was claimed by both Mexico and the United States. Neither country knew much about the lands crossed by such rivers as the Guadalupe, Brazos, Nueces, Trinity, and Rio Grande. Jean Louis Berlandier, a French naturalist, was part of a team sent out by the Mexican Boundary Commission to explore the area. His role was to collect specimens of flora and fauna and to record detailed observations of the landscapes and peoples through which the exploring party traveled. His observations, including sketches and paintings of plants, landmarks, and American Indians, were the first compendium of scientific observations of the region to be collected and eventually published. Here, historian Russell Lawson tells the story of this multinational expedition, using Berlandier's copious records as a way of conveying his view of the natural environment. Lawson's narrative allows us to peer over Berlandier's shoulder as he traveled and recorded his experiences. Berlandier and Lawson show us an America that no longer exists.This is a true story of discovery and discoverers in what was the northern frontier region of Mexico in the years before the Mexican War.

"We're going to usher that in as the foundation for building a strategy for our climate-change policy."               "Not only should you be consulted, it's the law. This plan will only proceed with success if we have aboriginal engagement... We have to recognize and I don't think people have grasped this yet, the impact (on government) with First Nations. We're looking at partnerships like we've never seen before."              "They're talking about Lake Winnipeg being at a tipping point and we get it, most of us who have been volunteering our time. But we're getting to the age where there's not much left in us. They're literally burning us out and the knowledge we have can't be replaced.  We know that the artificial way we manage our surface-water drainage has reached the point of no return. We're flushing our fields into the lake."

T1  - Pterosaurs:&nbsp;Flying contemporaries of the Dinosaurs
AN  - 2131228933
AB  - Pterosaurs or flying reptiles were the first vertebrates to evolve flight. These distant relatives of modern reptiles and dinosaurs lived from the Late Triassic (over 200 million years ago) to the end of the Cretaceous (about 65 million years ago) a span of some 135 million years. When they became extinct, no relatives survived them and as a result these prehistoric animals cannot readily be compared with our modern-day fauna. So what do we know of these highly succsessful animals? The present summary answers this and many more questions based on the most recent results of modern scientific research. After a short introduction to palaeontology as a science and its history related to pterosaurs, it explains what pterosaurs were, when and where they lived, and what they looked like. Topics such as disease, injury and reproduction are also discussed. Separated from this text are ‘Mark explains’ boxes. Each of these explanations puts one specific species in the spotlight and focuses on its lifestyle. They show how diverse pterosaurs were, from small insectivorous animals with a wingspan of nearly 40 centimetres to the biggest flying animals ever to take to the air, with wingspans of over 10 metres and with a way of life comparable to modern-day storks. The text is illustrated with many full colour photographs and beautiful palaeo-art prepared by experts in the field.

T1  - Native Listening:&nbsp;Language Experience and the Recognition of Spoken Words
AN  - 2130994137
AB  - An argument that the way we listen to speech is shaped by our experience with our native language. 
Understanding speech in our native tongue seems natural and effortless; listening to speech in a nonnative language is a different experience. In this book, Anne Cutler argues that listening to speech is a process of native listening because so much of it is exquisitely tailored to the requirements of the native language. Her cross-linguistic study (drawing on experimental work in languages that range from English and Dutch to Chinese and Japanese) documents what is universal and what is language specific in the way we listen to spoken language. 
Cutler describes the formidable range of mental tasks we carry out, all at once, with astonishing speed and accuracy, when we listen. These include evaluating probabilities arising from the structure of the native vocabulary, tracking information to locate the boundaries between words, paying attention to the way the words are pronounced, and assessing not only the sounds of speech but prosodic information that spans sequences of sounds. She describes infant speech perception, the consequences of language-specific specialization for listening to other languages, the flexibility and adaptability of listening (to our native languages), and how language-specificity and universality fit together in our language processing system. 
Drawing on her four decades of work as a psycholinguist, Cutler documents the recent growth in our knowledge about how spoken-word recognition works and the role of language structure in this process. Her book is a significant contribution to a vibrant and rapidly developing field.

T1  - Action Analysis for Animators
AN  - 2135412771
AB  - Action Analysis is one of the fundamental princples of animation that underpins all types of animation: 2d, 3d, computer animation, stop motion, etc. This is a fundamental skill that all animators need to create polished, believable animation. An example of Action Analysis would be Shrek's swagger in the film, Shrek. The animators clearly understood (through action analysis) the type of walk achieved by a large and heavy individual (the real) and then applied their observations to the animated character of an ogre (the fantastic). It is action analysis that enabled the animation team to visually translate a real life situation into an ogre's walk, achieving such fantastic results. Key animation skills are demonstrated with in-depth illustrations, photographs and live action footage filmed with high speed cameras. Detailed Case Studies, practical assignments and industry interviews ground action analysis methodology with real life examples. Action Analysis for Animators is a essential guide for students, amateurs and professionals.

T1  - Encyclopedia of Transnational Crime and Justice
AN  - 2132076062
AB  - Transnational crimes involve border crossings as an integral part of the criminal activity. They also include crimes that take place in one country with consequences that significantly affect other countries. Examples include human trafficking, smuggling (arms, drugs, currency), sex slavery, non-domestic terrorism, and financial crimes. Transnational organized crime refers specifically to transnational crime carried out by organized crime syndicates. Although several encyclopedias cover aspects of transnational crime, it is this encyclopedia's emphasis on transnational justice, as well, that differentiates it from the pack. Not only do we define, describe, and chart the crimes and criminal activity, we also will include significant coverage of policing those crimes and prosecuting them within domestic and international court systems. Accessible and jargon-free and available in both print and electronic formats, the one-volume Encyclopedia of Transnational Crime and Justice will contain such entries as arms smuggling, art fraud, charity fraud, hacking and computer viruses, copyright infringement, counterfeiting, drug smuggling, extradition, human trafficking, intelligence agencies, international banking laws, Internet scams, Interpol, money laundering, pollution and waste disposal, price fixing, prosecution, sanctions, sex slavery, tax evasion, terrorism, war crimes, the World Court, and more. Features & Benefits: 150 signed entries (each with Cross References and Further Readings) are organized in A-to-Z fashion to give students easy access to the full range of topics in transnational crime and justice. A thematic Reader's Guide in the front matter groups entries by broad topical or thematic areas to make it easy for users to find related entries at a glance. In the electronic version, the Reader's Guide combines with a detailed Index and the Cross References to provide users with convenient search-and-browse capacities. A Chronology in the back matter helps students put individual events into broader historical context. A Glossary provides students with concise definitions of key terms in the field. A Resource Guide to classic books, journals, and web sites (along with the Further Readings accompanying each entry) helps guide students to further resources in their research journeys. An Appendix includes the Congressional Research Service Report on International Terrorism and Transnational Crime.

T1  - Liars and Outliers:&nbsp;Enabling the Trust That Society Needs to Thrive
AN  - 2132094416
AB  - We don't demand a background check on the plumber who shows up to fix the leaky sink. We don't do a chemical analysis on food we eat. 
Trust and cooperation are the first problems we had to solve before we could become a social species. In the 21st century, they have become the most important problems we need to solve--again. Our global society has become so large and complex that our traditional trust mechanisms no longer work. 
Bruce Schneier, world-renowned for his level-headed thinking on security and technology, tackles this complex subject head-on. Society can't function without trust, and yet must function even when people are untrustworthy. 

Liars and Outliers reaches across academic disciplines to develop an understanding of trust, cooperation, and social stability. From the subtle social cues we use to recognize trustworthy people to the laws that punish the noncompliant, from the way our brains reward our honesty to the bank vaults that keep out the dishonest, keeping people cooperative is a delicate balance of rewards and punishments. It's a series of evolutionary tricks, social pressures, legal mechanisms, and physical barriers. 
In the absence of personal relationships, we have no choice but to substitute security for trust, compliance for trustworthiness. This progression has enabled society to scale to unprecedented complexity, but has also permitted massive global failures. 
At the same time, too much cooperation is bad. Without some level of rule-breaking, innovation and social progress become impossible. Society stagnates. 
Today's problems require new thinking, and 
Liars and Outliers provides that. It is essential that we learn to think clearly about trust. Our future depends on it.We don't demand a background check on the plumber who shows up to fix the leaky sink. We don't do a chemical analysis on food we eat.

BRUCE SCHNEIER is an internationally renowned security technologist who studies the human side of security. A prolific author, he has written hundreds of articles, essays, and academic papers, as well as eleven books that together have sold more than 400,000 copies. He has testified before Congress, is a frequent guest on television and radio, and is regularly quoted in the press. His blog and monthly newsletter at www.schneier.com reach over 250,000 devoted readers worldwide.

T1  - Managing Outdoor Recreation:&nbsp;Case Studies in the National Parks
AN  - 2134333874
AB  - The global popularity of outdoor recreation and ecotourism is on the increase. At present, there is little systematic information on the management practices that have been successful in National Parks. This book presents the issue of how to manage outdoor recreation in ways that protect the integrity of park resources and the quality of the visitor experience. Using case studies drawn from the U.S. National Park System, it illustrates a range of successful management approaches that can be applied worldwide. It is suitable for graduate and undergraduate students in outdoor recreation and park management practitioners.

T1  - The AH Receptor in Biology and Toxicology
AN  - 2130844065
AB  - The complete guide to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)--what it is, what it does, and what it might mean for the future of drug metabolism 
Providing a thorough and up-to-date overview of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates the induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes and diverse toxicities caused by dioxins, The AH Receptor in Biology and Toxicology is essential reading for toxicologists, chemists, biologists, pharmacologists, and other experts studying drug metabolism. 
Evidence suggests that the AHR protein imparts important physiological functions that place it at the crossroad of biology and toxicology, making it the focus of extensive research activity. Examining the unique dual role of AHR as both a toxicant and a factor in biological processes, this comprehensive reference work covers the full spectrum of AHR topics from basic concepts, toxicological risk analysis, and models, to polymorphisms and related diseases. Addressing epigenetic mechanisms, gene expression, reproductive/developmental toxicity, signal transduction, and transgenic animal models, the book runs the gamut of AHR knowledge. 
With contributions from renowned international experts, The AH Receptor in Biology and Toxicology puts the forefront of AHR research at your fingertips.

T1  - Oxidative Stress in Vertebrates and Invertebrates:&nbsp;Molecular Aspects of Cell Signaling
AN  - 2131779614
AB  - Unique comparative treatment of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses in vertebrates and invertebrates 
In one expertly edited and organized volume, 
Oxidative Stress in Vertebrates and Invertebrates brings together and analyzes the latest research findings in the field in order to present our current state of knowledge. The text bridges the gap between basic science and clinical studies, making it possible for readers to apply basic science to better understand and manage chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress. Moreover, it provides a unique comparative treatment of oxidative stress and antioxidant defenses in vertebrates and invertebrates, examining basic mechanisms, biomarkers, and oxidative stress-mediated chronic diseases. 
Featuring contributions from leading experts in oxidative stress-mediated cell signaling, the text is divided into two sections. 
Part I, Oxidative Stress in Vertebrate Systems, explores such topics as: 
 
 
Generation of reactive oxygen species and their role in cell survival and suicide  
 
Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease  
 
Comparison of oxidative stress in aging between vertebrates and invertebrates   
Part II, Oxidative Stress in Invertebrate Systems, explores such topics as: 
 
 
Effect of oxidative stress on insect endocrine control  
 
Innate immune system in airway epithelial cells of 
Drosophila  
 
Oxidative challenge and redox sensing in molluscs   
The final chapter provides a perspective on emerging research and directions for future investigations. Throughout the text, readers will find plenty of figures and line drawings of signal transduction pathways that illustrate key concepts and processes. Extensive references to the primary literature plus a bibliography facilitate further research into each topic. 
This text is recommended for biochemists, neuropharmacologists, toxicologists, and clinicians who need a state-of-the-science understanding of the mechanisms of oxidative stress in vertebrate and invertebrate systems.

T1  - Handbook of Neuroendocrinology
AN  - 2130998471
AB  - Neuroendocrinology, the discipline concerned with how the nervous system controls hormonal secretion and how hormones control the brain, is pivotal to physiology and medicine. Neuroendocrinology has disclosed and underpins fundamental physiological, molecular biological and genetic principles such as the regulation of gene transcription and translation, the mechanisms of chemical neurotransmission and intracellular and systemic feedback control systems. Reproduction, growth, stress, aggression, metabolism, birth, feeding and drinking and blood pressure are some of the bodily functions that are triggered and/or controlled by neuroendocrine systems. In turn, neuroendocrine dysfunction due to genetic or other deficits can lead, for example, to infertility, impotence, precocious or delayed puberty, defective or excessive growth, obesity and anorexia, Cushing's Syndrome, hypertension or thyroid disorders. These as well as neuroendocrine tumors are some of the themes covered in the 36 chapters of the Handbook. Drafted by internationally acknowledged experts in the field, the Handbook chapters feature detailed up-to-date bibliographies as well as "how do we know?" call out sections that highlight the experimental or technical foundations for major concepts, principles, or methodological advances in each area. Aimed at senior undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty in neuroscience, medicine, endocrinology, psychiatry, psychology and cognate disciplines, the Handbook of Neuroendocrinology satisfies an unmet need that will prove useful at the laboratory bench as well as in the office.  The most comprehensive up-to-date source covering basic principles, neural regulation, hormone/brain function and behavior, and neuroendocrine pathology "How do we know?" callout sections highlight core concepts Heavily illustrated with over 350 figures, 4-color throughout

T1  - Concepts and Fuzzy Logic
AN  - 2131819162
AB  - Leading researchers examine the usefulness and limitations of fuzzy logic for the psychology of concepts. 
The classical view of concepts in psychology was challenged in the 1970s when experimental evidence showed that concept categories are graded and thus cannot be represented adequately by classical sets. The possibility of using fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic for representing and dealing with concepts was recognized initially but then virtually abandoned in the early 1980s. In this volume, leading researchers--both psychologists working on concepts and mathematicians working on fuzzy logic--reassess the usefulness of fuzzy logic for the psychology of concepts. 
The book begins with two tutorials--one on concepts and the other on fuzzy logic--aimed at making relevant experimental and theoretical issues accessible to researchers in both fields. The contributors then discuss the experiments that led to the rejection of the classical view of concepts; analyze the various arguments against the use of fuzzy logic in the psychology of concepts and show that they are fallacious; review methods based on sound measurement principles for constructing fuzzy sets; introduce formal concept analysis and its capabilities when generalized by using fuzzy logic; consider conceptual combinations; examine lexical concepts; and propose a research program based on cooperation between researchers in the psychology of concepts and fuzzy logic.

T1  - Elite Women and Polite Society in Eighteenth-Century Scotland
AN  - 2148862078
AB  - Fashionable "polite" society of this period emphasised mixed-gender sociability and encouraged the visible participation of elite women in a series of urban, often public settings. Using a variety of sources (both men's and women's correspondence, accounts, bills, memoirs and other family papers), this book investigates the ways in which polite social practices and expectations influenced the experience of elite femininity in Scotland in the eighteenth century. It explores women's education and upbringing; their reading practices; the meanings of the social spaces and activities in which they engaged and how this fed over into the realm of politics; and the fashion for tourism at home and abroad. It also asks how elite women used polite social spaces and practices to extend their mental horizons and to form a sense of belonging to a public at a time when Scotland was among the most intellectually vibrant societies in Europe.
Women are shown to have played an important and very visible role in society at the time.

AN  - 2130993731
AB  - Patrick Riley was born in Paris in 1935 and was educated in Zurich and at King Edward VII School, King's Lynn. He graduated from University College Hospital Medical School in 1960 and gained his Ph.D. from the Department of Dermatological Histopathology under Arthur Jarrett. He joined the Department of Claude Rimington and began a series of cellular studies culminating in his appointment to a Chair of Cell Pathology at UCL in 1984. His work covered many fundamental aspects of cell pathology including free radical pathology, cell size control, regulation of cell proliferation and cancer. Patrick Riley was a founder member of the European Society for Pigment Cell Research and the International Federation of Pigment Cell Societies. He was the organiser and Chairman of the XVth International Pigment Cell Conference. He was the recipient of the Myron Gordon Award in 1993 and the Centenary Medal of Charles University. He has published extensively on melanocytes, melanogenesis and melanoma. He was joint Charman with Jan Borovansky of the recent FEBS Symposium on Melanins and Melanogenesis. 

Jan Borovansky was born in Prague in 1943. He graduated from Faculty of General Medicine, Charles University in 1966 and gained his Ph.D. in 1976 from the Department of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry under Professor J. Duchon. From 1970 to 1980 he was Lecturer in Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry. In 1980 he defended his Habilitation Thesis and became Associate Professor at the Charles University, and in 2004 he was appointed a Full Professor of Biochemistry. In 2008 he was elected to the Senate of the 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague. From the outset of his research career he has been involved in biochemical studies of melanosomes, and the enzymes associated with them. He has also published important studies on metal binding by melanins, the cytotoxicity of zinc, and free radical processes in normal and malignant pigment cells. Since 1979 he has been member of the International Pigment Cell Society and following its transformation into European Society for Pigment Cell Research (ESPCR) he was elected to its Council (1990-1998). In 1981 he was General Secretary of the 3rd European Workshop on Melanin Pigmentation and in 1998 he was President of the 8th Meeting of the ESPCR organized in Prague. As a long-standing member of the Editorial Board of Pigment Cell Research (1995-1998) he received a special Certificate of Appreciation from the International Federation of Pigment Cell Societies and Munksgaard in 1999. Since 2000 he has been a member of the International Board of the Pigment Cell Research Bulletin to which he regularly contributes with critical bibliographical reviews concerning melanosomes. He is a member of the Editorial Board of Folia Biologica (Prague) (2006-present) and a member of the Board of Advisors of the American Biographical Institute. He was an Honorary Research Fellow at University College London (1980, 1984) and has been a Visiting Scientist at several other institutions including Sheffield University (1978) and Leiden University Medical Centre (1997). He was the recipient of the Annual award of the Czechoslovak Oncological Society in 1975. Recently, he was appointed a member of the Organizing Committee of the 34th FEBS Meeting held in Prague and was responsible for planning the Symposium on Melanins and Melanogenesis.

AB  - A month later, having generated international headlines with the Investigator find, Harris and Moore were aboard a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker in the central Arctic, hoping to locate Franklin's Erebus and Terror, the twin holy grails of Arctic exploration.  Many national parks, historic sites, andmarine conservation areas contain artifacts of marine history that are not well-known to the general public.The submerged shipwreck treasures of Fortress of Louisbourg National Historic Site on Cape Breton Island are a case in point.  Excavated in 1996-97, the Elizabeth and Mary site has proved to be a time capsule of the late seventeenth century, with more than six thousand artifacts recovered.

T1  - Last of the commercial fishermen: Commercial fishery Once-flourishing Great Lakes fishery now plied by only a handful as industry ebbs
AN  - 880041805
AB  - "I swear to God they recognize a commercial boat," [Kendall Dewey] says. "They'll follow us around, hoping to steal a meal."              "There are times of the year when, if you're more than 200 feet offshore, you won't see a perch," says Dewey, one of a relative handful of full-time fishers still plying Lake Ontario. "Other times, you won't see one inside 200 feet of shore."              "We're slowly wending our way to provincial policy," says Peter Meisenheimer, executive director of the Ontario Commercial Fisheries Association. "There is none at the moment."

T1  - Primacy of Movement:&nbsp;Expanded second edition
AN  - 2131233734
AB  - And what is thinking? — Well, don't you ever think? Can't you observe yourself and see what is going on? It should be quite simple. You do not have to wait for it as for an astronomical event and then perhaps make your observation in a hurry. Ludwig Wittgenstein (1963:106) As I was led to keep in my study during many months worms in pots filled with earth, I became interested in them, and wished to learn how far they acted consciously, and how much mental power they displayed…. [A]s chance does not determine the manner in which [they drag] objects [leaves or paper] … into [their] burrows, and as the existence of specialized instincts for each particular case cannot be admitted, the first and most natural supposition is that worms try all methods until they at last succeed; but many appearances [i.e. observations] are opposed to such a supposition. One alternative alone is left, namely, that worms, although standing low in the scale of organization, possess some degree of intelligence. This will strike every one as very improbable; but it may be doubted whether we know enough about the nervous system of the lower animals to justify our natural distrust of such a conclusion. With respect to the small size of the cerebral ganglia, we should remember what a mass of inherited knowledge, with some power of adapting means to an end, is crowded into the minute brain of a worker ant.Charles Darwin (1976 [1881]:19–20,58)

T1  - Born in Africa:&nbsp;The Quest for the Origins of Human Life
AN  - 2131768291
AB  - Africa does not give up its secrets easily. Buried there lie answers about the origins of humankind. After a century of investigation, scientists have transformed our understanding about the beginnings of human life. But vital clues still remain hidden. In Born in Africa, Martin Meredith follows the trail of discoveries about human origins made by scientists over the last hundred years, recounting their intense rivalry, personal feuds, and fierce controversies as well as their feats of skill and endurance. The results have been momentous. Scientists have identified more than twenty species of extinct humans. They have firmly established Africa as the birthplace not only of humankind but also of modern humans. They have revealed how early technology, language ability, and artistic endeavour all originated in Africa; and they have shown how small groups of Africans spread out from Africa in an exodus sixty thousand years ago to populate the rest of the world. We have all inherited an African past.

T1  - Experiences of Freedom in Postcolonial Literatures and Cultures
AN  - 2130944903
AB  - Modern ideas of freedom and human rights have been repeatedly contested and are hotly debated at the beginning of the third millennium in response to new theories, needs, and challenges in contemporary life. This volume offers culturally diverse contributions to the debate on freedom from the literatures and arts of the postcolonial world, exploring experiences that evoke, desire, imagine, and perform freedom across five continents and two centuries of history. Experiences of Freedom opens with an introductory philosophical essay by Achille Mbembe and is divided into four sections that consider: * resisting history and colonialism * the right to move and to belong * the right to (believe in) free futures * imaginative freedom and critical engagement. Each section contains a piece of creative writing directly connected to these topics from authors Chris Abani, Anita Desai, Caryl Phillips, and Alexis Wright, followed by a selection of critical essays. Contributors: Chris Abani, Rochelle Almeida, Gil Anidjar, Jogamaya Bayer, Elena Bernardini, Anne Collett, Carmen Concilio, Paola Della Valle, Roberto Derobertis, Anita Desai, Lorna Down, Francesca Giommi, Gareth Griffiths, Dave Gunning, John C. Hawley, Peter H. Marsden, Russell McDougall, Achille Mbembe, Cinzia Mozzato, Kevin Newmark, Berndt Ostendorf, Mai Palmberg, Owen Percy, Kirsten Holst Petersen, Caryl Phillips, Annel Pieterse, Christiane Schlote, Nermeen Shaikh, Patrick Williams, Alexis Wright, and Robert J.

T1  - Hermaphroditism:&nbsp;A Primer on the Biology, Ecology, and Evolution of Dual Sexuality
AN  - 2131961981
AB  - While it is true that members of most sexually reproducing species can be defined as either male or female, those who belong to the rest of the biological world are not so simply understood. Hermaphroditic creatures reproduce both as male and as female individuals, providing a fascinating glimpse into alternative sexual practices in nature and their ecological and evolutionary successes and failures. Eloquently written by an award-winning biologist and pioneer in molecular ecology, this primer on hermaphroditism traces the phenomenon throughout Earth's myriad species, accounting for the adaptive significance of alternative sexual systems. Accessible and richly illustrated, the text maps the evolutionary origins of hermaphroditism, as well as its historical instances and fictional representations, underscoring the relevance of dual sexuality to our biological, intellectual, and cultural making. John C. Avise describes the genetics, ecology, phylogeny, and natural history of hermaphroditic plants, fish, and invertebrate animals and details organisms that either reproduce simultaneously as male and female or switch routinely between one sex and the other. Filled with surprising creatures and compelling revelations, this textbook stands alone in its clear yet comprehensive treatment of hermaphroditism and its unique challenge to the supremacy of separate sexes.

T1  - Tourists and other invasive species
AN  - 854537982
AB  - So, too, the strawberry guava, slowly crawling its way up the slopes of Lanihale, the "mountain" on Lanai. It chokes the native uluhe fern out of existence and thus threatens the Hawaiian petrel, which lives in burrows on the forest floor, protected by a covering of ferns. Kill the ferns, kill the petrels.              Was it an invasive plant? It didn't matter to her, she announced when questioned -- why should anyone care? Authorities can't stop people from being stupid and modern air travel transports all and sundry and their luggage (and all its contents including fruit, vegetables, plants and the occasional lizard or snake) without concern for the harm presented by such mostly innocent actions.              "There should be a 10-year prison term for bringing snakes or other alien species to our islands," he wrote. "Better yet, the offender should be locked up in a closed cell with the snake or whatever it may be."

T1  - The Crossley ID Guide:&nbsp;Eastern Birds
AN  - 2131023533
AB  - "
The Crossley ID Guide, published by Princeton University Press, is an awesome, major achievement, a stunning contribution to ornithological field identification."
--John Thaxton
Richard Crossley is an internationally acclaimed birder and photographer who has been birding since age 7 and who, by age 21, had hitchhiked more than 100,000 miles chasing birds across his native Britain and Europe. His love of the outdoors and his interest in teaching, design, and technology have shaped his unique vision for the future of birding and bird books. He is excited by the prospect of using new technologies to bring "reality birding" to a wide audience through many different media. He is a spokesperson for Nikon Sports Optics and coauthor of 
The Shorebird Guide, and lives with his wife and two daughters in Cape May, New Jersey.

T1  - The City, the River, the Bridge:&nbsp;Before and after the Minneapolis Bridge Collapse
AN  - 2132036618
AB  - On August 1, 2007, just after 6:00 p.m., during the evening rush hour in Minneapolis, the 1,900-foot-long, eight-lane I-35W bridge buckled and crashed into the Mississippi River. The unimaginable had happened right on the doorstep of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus. Many of the first responders were from the University, persevering in the midst of chaos and disbelief. In the ensuing weeks, research and engineering teams from the University reviewed the wreckage, searched for causes, and began planning for the future. The City, the River, the Bridge represents another set of responses to the disaster. Stemming from a 2008 University of Minnesota symposium on the bridge collapse and the building of a new bridge, it addresses the ramifications of the disaster from the perspectives of history, engineering, architecture, water science, community-based journalism, and geography. Contributors examine the factors that led to the collapse, the lessons learned from the disaster and the response, the policy and planning changes that have occurred or are likely to occur, and the impact on the city and the Mississippi River. The City, the River, the Bridge demonstrates the University's commitment to issues that concern the community and shares insights on public questions of city building, infrastructure, and design policy. Contributors: John O. Anfinson; Roberto Ballarini; Heather Dorsey; Thomas Fisher; Minmao Liao; Judith A. Martin; Roger Miller; Mark Pedelty; Deborah L. Swackhamer; Melissa Thompson.

T1  - Exit:&nbsp;Endings and New Beginnings in Literature and Life
AN  - 2132085231
AB  - If anything is certain in human existence, it is the exit. Before the universal yet radically singular event of death, however, history leaves its mark on us by determining which exits are possible, necessary or desirable.
 
 This collection of essays, which celebrates the achievement of the Swedish Africanist and postcolonial scholar Raoul Granqvist, deal with the broad theme of exit - in the form of exile, displacement, suicide, endings and, indeed, beginnings. After all, "In my end is my beginning" (T.S. Eliot).
 
 Childhood as exit rite in contemporary African literature (Camara Laye's 
L'Enfant Noir and Ishmael Beah's 
Long Way Gone); the Cameroonian director Jean Pierre Bekolo's controversial film 
Les Saignantes; an early play by Wole Soyinka; Ghana during the First World War; Zakes Mda's 
Cion; proto-nationalist writing on the Gold Coast; passing in Zoë Wicomb's 
Playing in the Light; the exile of South African and Caribbean writers; translation theory in the global South; public representations of Africans in north-east Bavaria; oral poetry in rural England; Fred Wah's Swedish-Chinese background in twentieth-century Canada; Toni Morrison's 
Beloved and infanticide; the open endings of the poetry of Paul Muldoon; the suicide of Virginia Woolf; the viability of global environmental policies - these are some of the topics that this book, in defiance of neat disciplinary boundaries, addresses. The closing section, "Voicing the Exit," transcends the academic format with its evocative literary representations of the experience of exit (in Tanzania, Uganda, Ukrainian Canada and elsewhere).

PsycCRITIQUES
"The editors fully achieved their goal of producing a state-of-the-science stress reference for use by investigators, educators, and practitioners with clinical and health interests."--
Psycho-Oncology 
"This is an important book about the scientific study of stress and human adaptation. It brings together both empirical data and theoretical developments that address the fundamental question of how psychosocial variables get inside the body to influence neurobiological processes that culminate in physical disease." From the Foreword by 
David C. Glass, PhD
Emeritus Professor of Psychology
Stony Brook University 
Edited by two leading health psychologists, 
The Handbook of Stress Science presents a detailed overview of key topics in stress and health psychology. With discussions on how stress influences physical health-including its effects on the nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune systems-the text is a valuable source for health psychologists, as well as researchers in behavioral medicine, neuroscience, genetics, clinical and social psychology, sociology, and public health.
This state-of-the-art resource reviews conceptual developments, empirical findings, clinical applications, and investigative strategies and tools from the past few decades of stress research. It represents all major approaches to defining stress and describes the themes and developments that characterize the field of health-related stress research.
The five sections of this handbook cover:  


Current knowledge regarding the major biological structures and systems that are involved in the stress response 
Social-contextual contributions to stress and to processes of adaptation to stress, including the workplace, socioeconomic status, and social support 
The concept of cognitive appraisal as it relates to stress and emotion psychological factors influencing stress such as, personality, gender, and adult development 
The evidence linking stress to health-related behaviors and mental and physical health outcomes 
Research methods, tools, and strategies, including the principles and techniques of both laboratory experimentation and naturalistic stress research

AB  - Soil micromorphology deals with the microscopic study of undisturbed soil and regolith samples, making use especially of thin sections and petrographic techniques. It exists as a discipline for almost 70 years. Micromorphology is used by pedologists, quaternary geologists, sedimentologists, and since two decennia intensively by archaeologists. This book provides the state of art in the field of genetic interpretation of micromorphological features, which is not restricted to the classic genetic soil horizons, but also covers processes of soil material formation and weathering, and the results of human activities and regoliths in a wider sense.

T1  - Persistent Organic Pollutants
AN  - 2131438696
AB  - Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are toxic, resistant to degradation, bioaccumulative, and display wide spatial distribution. They accumulate in humans and wildlife, and have been linked to cancer, as well as reproductive and immunological disorders. In 2001 a global treaty on POPs was agreed, to minimise and ultimately eliminate the release of POPs into the environment. The Stockholm Convention lists 12 groups of chemicals, and as of late 2008, a further 12 chemicals are under consideration for inclusion. This book addresses all of these chemicals, but focuses particularly on currently listed POPs that are still of major concern (e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls - PCBs), as well as new and emerging POPs that have been the subject of an explosion of scientific interest in the last decade, i.e. brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and perfluorinated  chemicals (PFCs). Other chapters address the challenges posed by the presence of POPs in the developing world; how the properties of chiral POPs can provide unique insights into their environmental sources, fate and behaviour; and issues arising from the presence of POPs in urban and indoor environments. Persistent Organic Pollutants provides a much-anticipated reference source for a wide audience including academics, industrial scientists and regulators.Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are toxic, resistant to degradation, bioaccumulative, and display wide spatial distribution.

T1  - Oil on Water:&nbsp;Tankers, Pirates and the Rise of China
AN  - 2131021826
AB  - The uninterrupted flow of oil is essential to globalisation and increasingly so as manufacturing and markets move Eastwards to Asia. All too often the movement of oil by ocean is something taken for granted, yet it is fraught with difficulty. This book looks at the way oil is moved and consumed mixing reportage, examples and hard-hitting facts.Paul French has been based in Shanghai for many years as Chief China Representative of research and analysis consultancy Access Asia. He is a regular commentator of China and North East Asia on the international media. He is the author of a number of previous books including the well received North Korea: State of Paranoia (Zed 2015).Sam Chambers has lived in China for a decade and his career as a travel and transport writer has taken him to the four corners of the country. He has co-authored a number of books including a travel guide to Yunnan and Hunan provinces as well as a transportation guide to the Yangtze. Writing for a variety of titles including The Sunday Times and The Royal Geographic Society Chambers follows very closely the day-to-day needs and demands of this rapidly evolving nation. After living in Hong Kong for many years he is now based in the northeastern city of Dalian.

T1  - Sydney's Aboriginal Past:&nbsp;Investigating the Archaeological and Historical Records
AN  - 2131943146
AB  - Revealing the diversity of Aboriginal life in the Sydney region, this study examines a variety of source documents that discuss not only Aboriginal life before colonization in 1788 but also the early years of first contact. This is the only work to explore the minutiae of Sydney Aboriginal daily life, detailing the food they ate; the tools, weapons, and equipment they used; and the beliefs, ceremonial life, and rituals they practiced. This updated edition has been revised to include recent discoveries and the analyses of the past seven years, adding yet more value to this 2004 winner of the John Mulvaney award for best archaeology book from the Australian Archaeological Association. The inclusion of a special supplement that details the important sites in the Sydney region and how to access them makes the book especially appealing to those interested in visiting the sites.

AN  - 2131924014
AB  - A guide to using molecular biology and immunological methods for the analysis of food 
Many of the analytical problems that food chemists face in the lab cannot be solved by chemistry alone, and so analytical chemists are turning to molecular biology and immunology for alternative approaches. Molecular Biological and Immunological Techniques and Applications for Food Chemists comprehensively explains the most important molecular biology and immunology methods, and illustrates their application in food analysis. 
Written by a distinguished group of experts, the coverage includes: 
 
Molecular Biological Methods--techniques explained, laboratory layout, PCR, real-time PCR, RFLP, SSCP, and sequencing 
 
Molecular Biology Applications--meat, genetically modified organisms (GMOs), food allergens, offal, and fish  
 
Immunological Methods--techniques explained and antibody-based detection methods  
 
Immunology Applications--animal speciation, international food allergen regulations (except Japanese), Japanese regulations and buckwheat allergen detection, egg allergen detection, soy allergen detection, milk allergen detection, gluten allergen detection, nut allergen detection, fish allergen detection, lupin allergen detection, mustard allergen detection, and celery allergen detection   
Clearly written and consistently edited to provide information to a wide range of readers, Molecular Biological and Immunological Techniques and Applications for Food Chemists offers an up-to-date reference for food scientists in government and industry, policymakers, and graduate-level students of food science, technology, and engineering.

T1  - Bat ecology turned upside down; A never-seen-before fungus is wiping out bat populations. One expert predicts the Little Brown Bat -- the most common species in Ontario -- will be gone within 10 years. Blair Crawford investigates the vanishing to find out what hangs in the balance.
AN  - 241338189
AB  - Earlier this year, a group of leading U.S. scientists from 12 states and federal wildlife agencies warned that the disease "has caused the most precipitous decline of North American wildlife in recorded history."  When they entered an abandoned mine in the Adirondack Mountains that was a known bat hibernaculum, they were shocked to find it filled with starving bats, their muzzles coated in a fine white fungus.

T1  - Bio-Inspired Nanomaterials and Nanotechnology
AN  - 2130925823
AB  - Nanoscience is a rapidly evolving field of studying and working with matter on an ultra-small scale, which was invented late in the twentieth century. Learning from bio-systems in nature, scientists began to design experiments to specifically couple biology with nanofabricated materials, devices and tools. Such bio-inspired nanoscience utilizes biological processes, shape, chemical and physical functionality of biomolecules for atom-levelly controllable fabrication of advanced materials with extreme precision. This book presents the current knowledge and understanding of bio-inspired nanoscience by a collection of eleven impressive chapters, covering several remarkable aspects. This book will also provide researchers in these fields with the newest developments in this rapidly evolving field for advancing research.

AB  - With such a bill to swallow there would very quickly be a discussion as to who has sovereignty rights over what area, who authorized the ship to come through, who can take legal action to recover the costs, who will co-ordinate the cleanup and to what environmental standards, etc.  Since the Northwest Passage is in Canadian internal waters there is no discussion; the Canadian government has full authority over those waters.

T1  - The Philosophy of Zoology Before Darwin:&nbsp;A Translated and Annotated Version of the Original French Text by Edmond Perrier
AN  - 2131337731
AB  - This long-overlooked survey of the development of evolutionary theory is by far the most thorough and balanced account of its kind. Unlike most of the recent Anglo-centric literature that tends to focus almost exclusively on Darwin and natural selection, it follows the work of naturalists of many nationalities who used paleontology, comparative anatomy, and embryology in order to establish a linear continuity of evolving life though the long span of geological time. 
 
Thorough historical survey of the development of the concept of evolution before the publication of Darwin's 'The Origin of Species'. 
Providing an alternative view of the recent literature and journal articles commemorating Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of publication of 'The Origin of Species'. 
Richly annotated with up to date information and explanations of the changing concepts and terminology as well as featuring an extensive Glossary and Biographical index. Thorough historical survey of the development of the concept of evolution before the publication of Darwin's On the Origin of Species Providing an alternative view of the recent literature and journal articles commemorating Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of publication of On the Origin of Species Richly annotated with up to date information and explanations of the changing concepts and terminology as well as featuring an extensive Glossary and Biographical index
Alex McBirney, a retired professor of Geology at the University of Oregon is the author of several books on the history of science, as well as his many studies on volcanology and igneous petrology. He developed an interest in Darwin while working in the Galapagos Islands and learned about Perrier's long-overlooked book through his friend, Philippe Janvier, at the Museum of Natural History in Paris. He saw that it was a very scholarly book of broad interest, but after reading few pages he realized why it had been almost totally ignored. Much of the text is very convoluted and almost incomprehensible, even to native French speakers. Enlisting the help of two colleagues, Gregory Retallack, a paleontologist, and Stanton Cook, a biologist, he undertook the task of translating it into a more readable form, so that it would be available to wide audience. The text has been annotated to take into account more recent work, and an extensive Glossary and Biographical Index have been added to provide a ready reference to the technical terms and persons cited in the text.

T1  - Companion to Clinical Neurology
AN  - 2131148631
AB  - This book is designed for the neurologist who (in this day of unusually strict accountability) needs to have at hand an authoritative guide to the diagnostic criteria for all conditions that he or she may be faced with in clinical practice. While originally conceived as a compendium of diagnostic criteria, the author has felt the need to expand the work to include definitions of practically all terms that are used in neurology today. Historical elements are also provided--including entries of important neurologists and neurosurgeons who have impacted the field. The result is an effective representation of the tools of the trade for the neurologist in training and a concise and precise source for the practicing neurologist. The second edition was published in 2003. Since then, advances in the definition of many neurological conditions have been made, all of which have been incorporated in the third edition. There has also been a fine tuning of the definitions and diagnostic criteria of many other conditions. The author has collated over 1300 articles since the last edition in order to update many of the entries. As such, the entries will have the most up-to-date definition of diseases, symptoms, diagnostic tests, and pearls of wisdom. The third edition remains an invaluable guide to the spectrum of neurological practice and with nearly 7,000 references this truly is the bible of neurological terms and conditions.

T1  - Aboard the Canadian Leader; A new pact between eight U.S. states and two provinces takes effect Monday, aimed at protecting the vast and essential, but beleaguered, inland sea we share
AN  - 270321612
AB  - "The Great Lakes Compact is an awesome victory," says Jeff Skelding, national campaign director for Healing Our Waters - Great Lakes Coalition. "No one predicted it could have happened so quickly. We can't protect the Great Lakes if there's no water in them ... The cocktail of assaults may be pushing the Great Lakes toward a tipping point, an irreversible change in the food web."                Venturing "light ship" (without cargo) across the stormy lakes of autumn can be unsettling. When 50-knot northerly winds lash the surface of Lake Erie, sending some lakers into sheltered anchorages, Captain [George Wheeler] decides to maintain course. Lake Erie is shallower than the other Great Lakes and more likely to be whipped up by storms. Ships at anchor off Toledo, Ohio, may suddenly find themselves aground when a short-term natural effect called "seiching" (pronounced "SAY-shing") drives surface water towards Buffalo, N.Y., at the eastern end of Lake Erie.                Sewage overflows are a major problem. "During heavy rainstorms," [Cameron Davis] says, "it's easy for treatment plants to risk being overwhelmed. There are two things we can do to help: Conserve water, so that we're not using as much, and use 'green infrastructure,' like rooftop gardens, to cut the amount of stormwater that needs to be treated."

T1  - Irish Nouns:&nbsp;A Reference Guide
AN  - 2131381460
AB  - This book is the first comprehensive source of reference on noun declensions in Modern Irish. It contains over 10,000 nouns as well as a generalized description of declension classes, case marking, and number marking in standard Irish, and a discussion of the nominal morphology that affects declension class and case form. -;This book presents the first comprehensive reference on noun declensions in Modern Irish. Whereas traditional descriptions of noun inflection are notoriously complex and filled with exceptions and irregularities, this reference guide provides a systematic and straightforward characterization of nominal paradigms, which also captures important generalizations about the inflection of nouns. Andrew Carnie proposes ten declension classes instead of the traditional five and separates off. seven major types of plural formation. He provides fully inflected paradigms for 1200 nouns, and a reference list of 10,000 Irish nouns annotated with their new declension class, their plural type and the form of the genitive singular and common case (nominative) plural. The book also includes. parallel information on the inflection of adjectives and prepositions. This unique reference tool will be invaluable not only to language researchers and authors, but to teachers and students of the language, whether they are native speakers or beginners. -

AN  - 2130871029
AB  - Plasma decontamination is a rapidly expanding area of modern science and engineering. An increasing number of engineers are using plasma methods for decontamination of chemical and biological agents. Plasma decontamination is effectively applied today to clean and sterilize different surfaces, high volume air and water streams, industrial exhausts, and even living tissue of animals and humans. This book provides a fundamental introduction to virtually all aspects of modern plasma decontamination, as well as the most recent technological achievements in the area. The book is segmented into four specific sections of modern plasma decontamination: (1) plasma bio-decontamination, including disinfection and sterilization of surfaces, water and air streams; (2) plasma decontamination of chemical agents, including cleaning of air, water, and industrial exhaust gases from different pollutants and especially volatile organic compounds VOC; (3) plasma treatment of living tissue, including different subjects of plasma medicine from skin sterilization to tissue engineering; (4) major electric discharges applied for the plasma-assisted decontamination of chemical and biological agents.

T1  - Canada's water crisis 'escalating'; Experts expect climate change to present serious water challenges, many of which already exist: [Final Edition]
AN  - 243890058
AB  - "There's an opportunity to find new water supplies without piping it in from somewhere -- finding new water supplies from conservation," said the Sierra Club's Morris. "You save money on infrastructure, you save on energy use from pumping and treating water."                 "We have this tendency to just turn on our taps and think, 'Well, there's an endless supply there,'" said [Tim Morris] of the Sierra Club. "But it's coming from somewhere and it's having an impact. Our water resources are not infinite and they do have a point where they're going to end up in trouble unless we do a better job of stewarding them."

T1  - Northern snakeheads latest threat to Canada's native fish population: [Final Edition]
AN  - 270299134
AB  - The northern snakehead can live under ice, inhabit cold temperatures and survive up to four days out of water, said [Becky Cudmore]. "The Canadian climate wouldn't prevent it from thriving here."                "Once most invasive species get hold of an area, they just overtake it," said Cudmore.                There are 185 invasive species in the Great Lakes, said Cudmore. The addition of the northern snakehead could leave the livelihoods of people like [John Bond] in a lurch. But he is optimistic.

T1  - Paradise not lost; With peace, quiet and clean water under siege, a green movement is on rise in central Ontario: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 439251566
AB  - "Technology allows you to work from wherever you are, which is great," says Terry Rees, executive director of the Peterborough-based Federation of Ontario Cottagers' Associations (FOCA; see foca.on.ca) "But...a lot of people have more traditional expectations of cottages with lots of native trees, wildlife, quiet and total darkness at night. It's increasingly a challenge to reconcile this as more people want to live here."                "We had a group of cottagers of like mind, interested in real peace and quiet and keeping the lake clean," says Jack Jewell, president of the Burnt Lake Cottagers' Association (BLCA) and a cottager for 37 years in an off-the-beaten-path area 185 kilometres north of Toronto. "We can watch deer run by and see a bear at the bird feeder. In other areas, this (wildlife) has been chased away."                PHOTOs BY BILL SANDFORD FOR THE TORONTO STAR Jewell enjoys the solitude of Burnt Lake, near Parry Sound, from his dock. Motorized watercraft are not allowed on the lake. Cottagers must use alternative energy sources such as solar, wind and propane. An airtight wood stove is the only heat source for Jack Jewell's cottage. He keeps a pot of water to add a little humidity when the stove is burning. Jack Jewell grills his food over wood on a setup built with local stone. PHOTOs BY BILL SANDFORD FOR THE TORONTO STAR Jack Jewell checks on his water heater, which is set on a hill outside the cottage. The lake water drawn into the tank is heated by sunlight. Burnt Lake cottagers use composting toilets, indoors and out. Burnt Lake's motorboat ban makes trips to the dock peaceful.  An airtight wood stove is the only heat source for Jack Jewell's cottage.

T1  - Phaeocystis, Major Link in the Biogeochemical Cycling of Climate-Relevant Elements
AN  - 2131363796
AB  - The ubiquitous marine microalgal species Phaeocystis plays an important role in biogeochemical cycles. Phaeocystis has a complicated life cycle, which makes it hard to decipher the role of this organism in ecosystem dynamics and hence its role in elemental cycles. This volume offers a selection of papers that have been presented at the final meeting of Working Group # 120 "Phaeocystis, major link in the biogeochemical cycling of climate-relevant elements", of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR). The combination of a diverse yet well selected spectrum of scientific disciplines - varying from phylogeny to microbiogeochemistry and ecological modeling - makes this a very complete volume; it will no doubt become an important reference to all those working with Phaeocystis. This book comprises important review papers by various top authors in the field. Topics that are addressed reach from the organism level (taxonomy and life cycles) to ecosystem dynamics (interaction with viruses and grazing dynamics). The role of Phaeocystis in carbon cycling is focus of various chapters, as well as its role in sulphur cycling. The last treatise of this volume comprises a synthesis of all the presentations of the meeting. This chapter highlights the most relevant insights that have been gained so far and defines urgent questions that need to be addressed in future research.High quality papers by leading authors Complete coverage of topics (including review papers and new science) Topics of broad geoscience relevance Up-to-date knowledge

T1  - The Illusion of Certainty:&nbsp;Health Benefits and Risks
AN  - 2131300572
AB  - The Illusion of Certainty: Health Benefits and Risks peels away the "veneer of certainty" which many of us attach to health risk and benefit information given to us in our daily lives. It was written and designed primarily to assist the public in comprehending and interpreting the uncertainty associated with the overwhelming amount of information on medical and environmental health risks.  The book uses unique, visual presentations and case studies to explain the benefits of medical screening tests (e.g., mammography, prostate and colorectal cancer screening, cholesterol screening) and drugs (e.g., statins, Vioxx(tm)) and the risks associated with exposure to environmental contaminants (e.g., lead, dioxin, radon).  This book will help patients and their families get more involved in making medical decisions, and citizens face critical questions about the environment. By putting the complexities of risk analysis in terms the general public can relate to, the authors are empowering people to make well-informed decisions. 
About the Authors: 
Erik Rifkin is the president of an environmental consulting firm that specializes in the characterization of ecological and human health risks from exposure to soil, water, air and sediments. His firm provides assistance and guidance to federal and state regulatory agencies and corporations regarding the nature and magnitude of environmental risks and potential remediation strategies. Dr. Rifkin's broad experience includes the communication of health risks and benefits to groups concerned with these issues.  
Edward J. Bouwer is Professor of Environmental Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.  He has extensive experience with water and soil pollution and treatment.  His research provides guidance on defining and managing environmental risks and how to interpret human and ecological health risk data.  Dr. Bouwer has served on several National Research Council committees that provide guidance on managing human and ecological risk 
Guest Author Bob Sheff, MD, received his medical training as a radiologist at UCLA and Johns Hopkins Medical Center. He spent his career praticing medicine and running one of the largest medical managed-care systems in the U.S. Now semi-retired, he devotes his time to helping non-profit organizations and individual people address their medical concerns. He lives in Columbia, Maryland. 
Written for:
 Undergraduate, graduate, medical and nursing students, engineers, government advisory agencies, research scientists, lawyers, politicians and anyone interested in risk analysis and the interpretation of risk values.
This book provides the reader with an understanding and appreciation of the risk assessment process and the ability to objectively interpret health risk values. Included is an explanation of the uncertainty inherent in the assessment of risks as well as an explanation of how the communication and characterization of risks can dramatically alter the perception of those risks. Risk statements tend to be presented as if they are authoritative, definitive, and based on clear and unequivocal evidence, which leads to the illusion of certainty. In this context, this book compares and contrasts the differences between risk assessment and causality. Case studies illustrate the strengths and limitations of characterizing certain risks. Using the accepted risk assessment paradigm proposed by the National Research Council, these case studies illustrate which risk values have merit and why other assessments fail to meet basic criteria.
Foreword is written by Dr. Jared Cohon, President of Carnegie Mellon University 
Of interest to millions of people who are concerned with true benefit of screening tests such as mammography, prostate cancer screening, cholesterol screening and colorectal cancer screening 
Informs the public on true risks and benefits of taking statins, drugs such as Vioxx(tm), the risks of smoking and the risks of exposure to environmental contaminants such as dioxin, mercury and radon 
Provides practical information and tools to make informed decision on risk and benefits 
Book is written to explain complex concepts in an accessible manner 
Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras

T1  - Randle Reef upgrade begins in '09: [Final Edition]
AN  - 358287493
AB  - "I think this government supports the concept," he said. "I think it's just fitting it into their budget at the right time. We have to keep lobbying our local MPs and MPPs to keep the pressure on."

              
   Randle Reef is the most contaminated area in Canada, second only to the Sydney Tar Ponds in Nova Scotia. Mr. [Keith Robson] said the Conservative government has provided money to Nova Scotia for the tar ponds clean up, so it's only natural the Conservatives need to fully fund the Randle Reef clean up. Containing Randle Reef is a key component of the Hamilton Remedial Action Plan's goal to remove the harbour from the International Joint Commission's list of Areas of Concern.

              
   Mr. Robson said the port authority has spent about $1.1 million on improving the harbour's environment, with an additional "hundreds of thousands of dollars" being spent annually on bolstering environmental programs.

T1  - Lake Simcoe 'Ladies' to the rescue: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 439173651
AB  - Ladies co-founder Jane Meredith says her family first settled on the Keswick side of Lake Simcoe in the 1880s. "Ten years ago, I used to drink the water."                 Another initiative has been a research document, The Naked Truth Going Behind the Science of Lake Simcoe, that the Ladies commissioned from the Windfall Ecology Centre, a community-based, non-profit organization in Woodbridge set up to promote environmental solutions.                 One of the core accomplishments of the Ladies of the Lake has been to draw together different communities in the watershed through their common concerns for rescuing Lake Simcoe. The awareness projects last summer included a blanket invitation to everyone to contribute their ideas for solutions and priorities in cleaning up the lake.

T1  - Phraseology and Culture in English
AN  - 2131786533
AB  - This volume explores the cultural dimension of a wide range of multiword units in English. Its contributions focus on particular lexemes (e.g. enjoy and its collocates), types of multiword units (e.g. proverbs and similes), use-related varieties (such as the language of tourism or answering-machine messages), and user-related varieties (such as Aboriginal English or African English). They are preceded by a prologue, tracing the development of the study of formulaic language, and followed by an epilogue, which draws together the various threads laid throughout the volume. This is the first book-length publication devoted entirely to the study of the relation between English phraseology and culture.

T1  - Lectures in Astrobiology
AN  - 2130909622
AB  - Based on material delivered at several summer schools, this book is the first comprehensive textbook at the graduate level encompassing all aspects associated with the emerging field of astrobiology. Volume II gathers another set of extensive lectures covering topics so diverse as the formation and the distribution of elements in the universe, the concept of habitability from both the planetologists' and the biologists' point of view and artificial life. The contributions are held together by the common goal to understand better the origin of life, its evolution and possible existence outside the Earth's realm. The volume ends with 120 pages of a very useful appendix comprising "Some Astrophysical Reminders", "Useful Astrobiological Data" and "An Astrobiological Glossary".

T1  - Cabinet of Curiosities:&nbsp;Mark Dion and the University as Installation
AN  - 2131998909
AB  - The richly illustrated essays in Cabinet of Curiosities records the creative processes behind an installation designed by contemporary artist Mark Dion at the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota, a collaboration of museum staff, students, and collection curators. Drawing from university collections, Dion and the curators chose seven hundred objects representative of the state’s history, ranging from a Bierstadt painting of Minnehaha Falls to Hubert Humphrey memorabilia, as well as objects that would have fascinated Renaissance viewers—such as mirrors and the world’s smallest plant—and arranged them into categories typical of Renaissance inquiry, such as the Underworld, the Sea, Humankind, and the Library. Together, the cabinets represented the university in miniature, just as their Renaissance precursors had attempted to represent microcosms of the world. Cabinet of Curiosities offers commentary on the ways in which collecting has undergirded the creation of knowledge within universities and in Western society.

T1  - Evaluation of the Sea Grant Program Review Process
AN  - 2131365971
AB  - The National Sea Grant College Program, created in 1966, has grown into a nationwide network of 30 individual Sea Grant programs located at some of the nation's top universities. Administered through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Sea Grant program is a state-federal partnership that funds marine and Great Lakes applied research, education, and outreach. The Sea Grant program has been a major source of funding in the United States for work in the areas of marine aquaculture, shellfish disease, aquatic nuisance species, coastal and estuarine ecology, seafood safety, marine biotechnology, marine engineering, marine technology development, and marine policy. An earlier National Research Council report (1994) recommended that Sea Grant develop a process to review the individual programs on a four year cycle. A review process was implemented in 1998 and modified by Congress in the 2002 reauthorization of the Sea Grant program. The legislation also contained a request for this National Research Council study to provide an assessment of the review process and recommendations for ways to improve the overall effectiveness of the evaluation process to ensure fairness, consistency, and enhancement of performance. The report recommends strengthening the strategic planning process for the individual programs, increasing the interaction between the National Sea Grant Office and the individual programs, and improving the program rating and ranking process through annual assessments by the national office. In addition, the report provides recommendations for improving the independent reviews that are conducted on a four year cycle.

T1  - Kanji Handbook:&nbsp;(JLPT All Levels) This Japanese Character Dictionary and Kanji Textbook Uses an Innovative and Effective System
AN  - 2131895221
AB  - This massive text is the ultimate authoritative book on learning Japanese Kanji. The Kanji Handbook presents an ingenious and tested method to learn the 1,945 kanji characters taught in all Japanese language schools. Through the use of "KanjiHybrids"--a concept invented by the author--learners of Kanji and taught to link the characters mentally with English words to form one integral and indivisible unit. This innovative mnemonic device has been proven to train the learner to retain each kanji in the memory much better than simple repetition of the kanji alone--as well as enabling users to differentiate similar-looking kanji characters. Specific learning strategies also enable users to progress quickly from the beginner to advanced level kanji, with stroke orders shown clearly for each kanji character. Eight different indexes-including the highly useful Flip-it Index--form the last part of this unique handbook. Contains the complete list of all 1,945 kanji characters taught in Japanese schools. Presents a new KanjiHybrids system linking kanji characters with English words to aid memorization. Innovative learning strategies guide learners at all levels from beginner to advanced.

T1  - Chernobyl - What Have We Learned?:&nbsp;The Successes and Failures to Mitigate Water Contamination over 20 Years
AN  - 2131870696
AB  - Twenty million people have been exposed to Chernobyl radionuclides through the Dnieper River aquatic pathways.  This book presents a 20-year historical overview and comprehensive study results of the aquatic environment affected by the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident.  During this time, many water quality management practices and countermeasures were enacted.  The book presents in-depth analyses of these water remediation actions, using current science and mathematical modeling, and discusses why some were successful, but many others failed. The chapter entitled Where Do We Go From Here? incorporates a comprehensive discussion of the planned New Safe Confinement (NSC) structure to cover the Chernobyl plant. The book closes with a summary and conclusions drawn from these analyses, making it a valuable reference tool for the future. 
This book will be of interest to engineers, scientists, decision-makers, and those involved in radiation protection and radioecology, environmental protection and risk assessment, water remediation and mitigation measures, and radioactive waste disposal. 
In addition, the detailed, almost day-to-day, emergency responses to the Chernobyl accident described in this book will also be useful to people developing emergency and long-term responses to accidental or intentional (by terrorists) releases of radionuclides, toxic chemicals and biological agents.

T1  - Report warns of 'alien' threat: [Final Edition]
AN  - 355801958
AB  - Afghanistan in particular harbours at least 28 troublesome species that have already invaded that war-torn country and could threaten Canada if inadvertently carried back home in a soldier's backpack or in the mud caked on a Jeep chassis.                 "Worse yet, Afghanistan may harbour native species that could become IASs (invasive alien species) in Canada," with autumn olive and Himalayan knotweed cited as two potential threats.                 "As I was aware that the federal government was developing a strategy on invasive alien species, I thought it was timely also for us to review our departmental program," said Robert Cretien, a civilian agronomist in charge of pest management at National Defence.

T1  - Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology
AN  - 2135022019
AB  - Over the last few years, the language of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology has expanded enormously to the extent that few scientists can expect to be familiar with all the terms and concepts. This is partly due the massive influence of the Genome and successive "-omics" projects which have developed in to many new areas of research. At the same time, terms from other subject areas - including mathematics, statistics, physics and other life sciences - appear increasingly in the; biochemical literature.; The Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology provides a comprehensive and 'encyclopaedic' survey of modern biochemistry and molecular biology. This new edition of the popular dictionary has been comprehensively reviewed and updated to include many important new concepts and words. The entries are short but informative, providing up-to-date information on a broad range of topics, including definitions for terms from the fields of Bioinformatics, Biophysics, Cell Biology,; Chemistry, Genetics, Immunology, Mathematics, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Systems Biology, and Toxicology. There are over 21000 main entries, which include: details of biochemical substances and the processes in which they are involved, methods and concepts in molecular biology, and definitions of biochemical; symbols and abbreviations. Each entry is accessibly written. They point out pitfalls where terms are often confused, and explain the precise syntax of biochemical terms such as Greek letters and other formatting, which are invariably lost when searching the Internet. In addition, the dictionary is generously illustrated with over 900 chemical structures.; The Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology will serve as an invaluable reference text for student and professional biochemists and molecular biologists seeking information both from within and outside their own fields. It will also be of relevance and use to a broader audience of life scientists seeking an authoritative overview of fundamental principles.

T1  - Perceptual Coherence:&nbsp;Hearing and Seeing
AN  - 2131236421
AB  - The job of any sensory system is to create objects in the world out of the incoming proximal stimulus energy. The energy is neutral; it does not specify the objects itself. Thus, sensory systems must abstract the energy that does specify objects and differentiate it from the noise energy. The perceptual variables that specify objects for both listening and looking become those of contrast and correlated change across space and time, so that perceiving occurs at several spatial and temporal scales in parallel. Given that the perceptual goals and perceptual variables are equivalent, the rules of perceiving will be the same for all senses.The goal of this book is to describe these conceptual similarities and differences between hearing and seeing. Although it is mathematical and conceptually analytical, the book does not make explicit use of advanced mathematical concepts. Each chapter combines information on hearing and seeing, and gives a detailed treatment of a small number of topics. The first three chapters present introductory information, including properties of auditory and visual worlds, how receptive fields are organized to pick out those properties, and whether the receptive fields are optimized to pick up the structure of the sensory world. Each subsequent chapter considers one type of perceptual element: texture, motion, contrast and noise, color, timbre, and object segmentation. Each type of perceptual situation is described as a problem of discovering the correlated energy, and the research presented focuses on how humans manage to perceive given the complicated set of skills required. This book is intended for use in upper-division undergraduate courses in perception and sensation, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience. It will fill the slot between textbooks that cover perception and sensory physiology and neuroscience, and more advanced monographs that cover one sense or topic in detail.

T1  - Ontario Provincial Police stay afloat during marine training: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349523995
AB  - "We can't have oars on board as a requirement for say a paddle boat," he said. "The oars are built in, but for other motorized vehicles oars would be mandatory."

              
   The Thursday lectures also dove into topics that at one time were most popular among marine biologists, specifically aquatic-invasive species.

              
   The threat of foreign species taking over local lakes has become such a problem in Ontario that the province's police force has made it illegal to be in possession of certain species. One of the more popular species is the Round goby, a fish that some people could use for bait.

T1  - Toronto Zoo hosting variety of activities: [Final Edition]
AN  - 362508397
AB  - In a move recommended by the Species Survival Plan (SSP) for captive North American Indian rhinoceroses, [Patrick], a genetically valuable animal, is relocating to the Florida's White Oak Plantation, a breeding and conservation facility. The move is a positive one for the 2,500 kilogram rhino. He'll enjoy a superb climate, lots of paddock space, and plenty of privacy since the Plantation is not open to the public.

              
   Found in jungle and grassland areas in Nepal, Bengal and Assam, the Indian rhino, in comparison to the African or white rhino, has a heavy, armoured look and only one horn. After a gestation period of 19 months, a single young is born weighing 75 to 165 pounds. The lifespan may extend to 50 years.

              
   On Monday, May 1, a panel of zoo judges (consisting of zoo staff and zoo kids) will narrow the list down to the Top five or six names. Those names will be posted on the TVOKids.com website and will be voted on by the public from May 2 to 8. The most popular name will be given to the little guy.

T1  - Alien invader from North America; Eastern grey squirrel at home in Europe Taken to England as a novelty in late 19th century: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 438971033
AB  - Widely considered cute and virtually always the first wild animal encountered by most of us, Eastern grey squirrels generally blend into the background, except when they're begging for bread crumbs. Of course, they're not without their bad habits. Eastern grey squirrels - which are commonly black in many areas, especially southern Ontario - are expert at raiding bird feeders and will occasionally search inside poorly covered garbage cans and bags for a quick meal, but are generally considered more curious than notorious.                 Grey squirrels don't just outcompete red squirrels, which are about one-third their size, they also take their nest holes and kill their young. Worse yet, grey squirrels carry parapoxvirus, a disease also known as squirrel pox, which is harmless in greys but often fatal in reds. The overall result has been the greys have largely replaced reds wherever greys exist. According to a 1995 study commissioned by the European Squirrel Initiative, a watchdog group representing national governments and universities, there were about 2 million Eastern grey squirrels in England and no more than 30,000 reds.                 "All data gathered in Britain and Italy confirm that in areas colonized by the grey squirrel, the native red squirrel rapidly becomes extinct," says Piero Genovesi, a professor at the University of Bologna, a researcher with the Italian Wildlife Institute and an expert on the squirrel invasion. "In Piedmont, the grey squirrel had been confined until 1970 within the suburbs of Turin in Stupinigi Park where the red squirrel was also present. The last observation of a red squirrel there was recorded during the winter of 1979-80."

AB  - Another POSC all candidates night tradition is, that the host, Pembroke Outsdoor Sportsman's Club, limits the range of topics to be discussed with candidates to outdoor-related matters and activities over which the federal government exercises jurisdiction and control.

              
   In broad general terms, at the POSC all candidates night, questions will be entertained which directly pertain to federal jurisdiction, addressing matters which impact negatively on our heritage activities, eg. angling, hunting, trapping and recreational target shooting plus firearm ownership.

              
   Insects hiding in packaging materials also enter our continent, with the potential of wiping out massive acreages of forest lands. Others again are plants, such as purple loose strife, readily available as ornamental plants in many nurseries, which when growing wild from seeds, are chocking many wetlands in Ontario and elsewhere.

T1  - Handbook of Categorization in Cognitive Science
AN  - 2131438391
AB  - Categorization, the basic cognitive process of arranging objects into categories, is a fundamental process in human and machine intelligence and is central to investigations and research in cognitive science. Until now, categorization has been approached from singular disciplinary perspectives with little overlap or communication between the disciplines involved (Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Cognitive Anthropology). Henri Cohen and Claire Lefebvre have gathered together a stellar collection of contributors in this unique, ambitious attempt to bring together converging disciplinary and conceptual perspectives on this topic.Categorization is a key concept across the range of cognitive sciences, including linguistics and philosophy, yet hitherto it has been hard to find accounts that go beyond the concerns of one or two individual disciplines. The Handbook of Categorization in Cognitive Science provides just the sort of interdisciplinary approach that is necessary to synthesize knowledge from the different fields and provide the basis for future innovation.  Professor Bernard Comrie, Department of Linguistics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Germany Anyone concerned with language, semantics, or categorization will want to have this encyclopedic collection. Professor Eleanor Rosch, Dept of Psychology, University of California, Berkeley, USA

T1  - The Roots of Educational Change:&nbsp;International Handbook of Educational Change
AN  - 2134353616
AB  - The purpose of this first volume of the International Handbook of Educational Change is to delineate the roots of a movement toward educational change that grew up in - and grew out of - the turbulent political, social, economic and cultural life of the post-World War II years. Its authors, who helped to create and shape the field, examine their work from current perspectives, raising issues that illustrate the connections between the recent history of education in general, and the field of educational change in particular. The book deals with a range of issues, from the effects of the GI Bill to the effects of school environment on student learning, from the political realities of educational policy to social realities of teachers. Like subsequent volumes, this book brings together evidence and insights on educational change issues from leading writers and researchers in the field from across the world.Brings together evidence and insights on educational change issues from leading writers and researchers in the field from across the world Will help educators understand and deal effectively with the immensely complex change problems that are customary today Each of the four volumes of this Handbook of Educational Change form state-of-the-art collections of analyses of eductional change processes and practices

T1  - Studying migration patterns of Scaup: [Final Edition]
AN  - 354183214
AB  - A most recent update of the five female Scaup that staged this spring at Long Point Bay shows that the Scaup have dispersed. As of July, one female Scaup has arrived to breed in Southern Yukon, one on Hudson Bay and the other three are in the Beck-Deny Region of Saskatchewan.

              
   To understand this relationship of the selenium and the Scaup reproduction difficulties, a study has been recently launched to study the migration patterns and chronology of female lesser Scaup that stop at Long Point Bay, Lake Erie in the spring. Conservation groups, hunting clubs, Environment Canada, and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, have provided funding for the project.

T1  - Endocrine Disruption:&nbsp;Biological Bases for Health Effects in Wildlife and Humans
AN  - 2135149079
AB  - This book addresses the biological effects of the reasonably large number of classes of compounds that have been recognized as endocrine disrupters. These compounds have been found to persist as pollutants in the environment, and have been blamed for causing developmental disorders and/or fertility problems in fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and possibly humans. This book presents the relevant fundamentals of the endocrine systems of animals and humans, the toxicology, developmental toxicology, ecology, and risk assessment methods, and lays out the current state of understanding for the whole field, organized by the classes of compounds that have been identified as endocrine disrupters.

T1  - Man and Beast
AN  - 2132031817
AB  - For Irish-born poet and zookeeper Eric Cole, the fourteen lines and rhythmic patterns of the sonnet echo the very building blocks of life. Within the basic structure of simple genetic material lies the limitless potential for the existence of all living things, be they man or beast. So, too, within the simple structure of the sonnet, there is a similar universe of untold possibilities. Now, in these robust and stylish poems, the mysteries of the animal kingdom are explored with genuine scientific curiosity and rendered with tenderness, stimulating language and unmistakable Irish wit. From the reviled Portuguese man o' war to the glorious hyacinth macaw, from the elusive snow leopard to the bizarre pangolin and even to the human animal itself, Cole demonstrates how life exists in inexplicable but nonetheless indispensable variety. This collection serves to remind us what we stand to lose if we fail to appreciate the small states of grace that befall us in the disappearing natural wonders of our world.

T1  - Lake Simcoe still an angler's dream: [Final Edition]
AN  - 352688135
AB  - Grab your gear and head out! Anglers in Innisfil are fortunate to have one of the best fishing holes in the province at their doorstep. Will Wegman, of the Ministry of Natural Resources and an avid tournament angler on Lake Simcoe, says that while the lake has some issues that are trying to be addressed, it is still a favourite for locals and fishermen from across Ontario.

              
   "[Belle Ewart] has a good, long public pier where people catch yellow perch, bass and the odd pike. And they can fish off the shore in Innisfil Beach Park. It's a great place for a family to spend a couple of hours - Innisfil residents are lucky to have it so near."

              
   "The adults stay in Georgian Bay and migrate up the Nottawasaga River and various tributaries - including Innisfil Creek - to lay their eggs in March and April. Brook trout are a resident species and remain in Innisfil Creek all year long - they are predominately in the headwaters near Line 5," he said.

AN  - 2131337431
AB  - Leading figures in ancient philosophy present eighteen original papers on three key themes in the work of Richard Sorabji. The papers dealing with Metaphysics range from Democritus to Numenius on basic questions about the structure and nature of reality: necessitation, properties, and time. The section on Soul includes one paper on the individuation of souls in Plato and five papers on Aristotle's and Aristotelian theories of cognition, with a special emphasis on perception. Thesection devoted to Ethics concentrates upon Stoicism and the complex views the Stoics held on such topics as motivation, akrasia, oikei--ocirc--;sis, and the emotions. The volume also contains a fascinating 'intellectual autobiography' by Sorabji himself, and a full Bibliography of his works.

T1  - Scoring the Rorschach:&nbsp;Seven Validated Systems
AN  - 2131744523
AB  - Exner's Comprehensive System has attracted so much attention in recent years that many clinicians and personality researchers are unaware that alternative Rorschach scoring systems exist. This is unfortunate, because some of these systems have tremendous clinical value. Scoring the Rorschach: Seven Validated Systems provides detailed reviews of the best-validated alternative approaches, and points to promising new paths towards the continued growth and refinement of Rorschach interpretation. The editors set the stage with an extended introduction to historical controversies and cutting-edge empirical methods for Rorschach validation. Each chapter presents a different Rorschach scoring system. A brief history is followed by detailed information on scoring and interpretation, a comprehensive summary of evidence bearing on construct validity, and discussion of clinical applications, empirical limitations, and future directions. A user-friendly scoring "manual" for each system offers readers practical guidance. The systems tap a broad array of content areas including ego defenses, thought disorder, mental representations of self and others, implicit motives, personality traits, and potential for psychotherapy. All psychologists seriously engaged in the work of personality assessment will find in this book welcome additions to their professional toolkits.

T1  - Mothballing Welland canal 'out of the question': [Final Edition]
AN  - 376088380
AB  - "It's time to close the Welland Canal," Gary Fahnenstiel, an expert on non-indigenous species who has extensively studied the Great Lakes, told a newspaper in Michigan. "We have a natural choke point and we can shut off the flow of exotics into the Great Lakes."

              
   Critics of Fahnenstiel's idea to shut the canal for good say it would cripple the economy of Niagara and the region surrounding the Great Lakes. "It just doesn't make sense," said Port Colborne Mayor Ron Bodner, whose city is still bisected by the fourth canal built in 1932.

              
   Aside from the economic destruction the canal closing would bring, Bodner said it would have widespread environmental impacts across the Great Lakes region if the 32-million tonnes of coal, grain, steel slabs and other cargo that is shipped via the canal each year had to be delivered by transport truck.

These compounds have been found to persist as pollutants in the environment, and have been blamed for causing developmental disorders and/or fertility problems in fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and humans. The book presents the relevant fundamentals of the endocrine systems of animals and humans, the toxicology, developmental toxicology, ecology, and risk assessment methods, and lays out the current state of understanding for the whole field, organized by the classes of compounds that have been identified as endocrine disrupters.

T1  - Consider closing canal, says Michigan scientist: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349650309
AB  - He said authorities should look at all options to fix the problem, even drastic ones such as closing the Welland Canal, which allows access from Lake Ontario to the upper Great Lakes by ocean- going ships. The closure would surely cause economic, trade and logistical problems, but it would eliminate the spread of invasive species in all of the Great Lakes except Ontario, [Gary Fahnenstiel] said.

              
   Fahnenstiel said compared to complex environmental problems such as global climate change, the solution for saving the Great Lakes from invasive species is relatively simple. He said it just means stopping sea-going ships from entering the lakes.

              
   Fahnenstiel said he would support a proposal by some Canadian scientists to stop transatlantic shipping at Montreal and have loads transferred to Great Lakes ships. That would lead to an environmental solution -- and full use of the underutilized Great Lakes fleet -- without closing the canal, he said.

T1  - Scientists brace for crab invasion: [Final Edition]
AN  - 267100472
AB  - Over several decades, the voracious crab has moved to England, Germany and California. The crab often travels in the ballast of ships, but scientists in California believe it was intentionally released in the San Francisco Bay.                 The crab is a delicacy in China, prized for the aphrodisiac qualities of the female crab's ovaries. The crab is secretly served at Chinese restaurants in the Bay area, according to Kathy Hieb, a marine biologist with California's Department of Fish and Game.                 Fisherman Bernard Cte found the crab in his nets on the south shore of the St. Lawrence, across from Quebec City.

T1  - Still time to keep Marcy's Woods public: [Final Edition]
AN  - 361328898
AB  - Habitat loss can be stopped now, especially if governments plays a stronger role in permanently protecting natural heritage sites like Marcy's Woods in Fort Erie, one of Lake Erie's few remaining relatively unmodified coastal habitats.

              
   Time is running out for protecting Marcy's Woods. In these remaining months of the zoning order, Lake Erie groups on both sides of the border urge provincial and local governments to use their powers to ensure this valuable remnant of Ontario's and Lake Erie's natural heritage be repatriated to the public trust.

T1  - An ocean in transition
AN  - 374505923
AB  - Since that discovery in 1999, there have been about eight verified catches of green  crab off the Vancouver Island coast. The most disturbing find to date has been in Little Espinosa Inlet in Nootka Sound - the first possible indication of a breeding population, said Pacific Biological Station marine scientist Glen Jamieson.

              
   With so many unknowns, Jamieson said the fear is that of the 100 exotic species, one might become dominant, forcing out other species the way Scotch broom and blackberry can on the terrestrial side.

              
   "Of the 100 introduced species, one or two could take off to the detriment of other species," Jamieson said. "Our concern is the green crab may be one of those species."

T1  - Grimsby club wants gobies gone; Invites families to 'Great Goby Tournament' on Sept. 18 at 40 Mile Creek: [Final Edition]
AN  - 270201082
AB  - It's too late to get the gobies out of the Great Lakes now that they're so well-established, said Ron Dermott, a Burlington-based biologist with the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.                 The gobies will migrate to deeper water for the winter, then they'll come back in the spring, probably thicker than ever. Females lay 300 to 1,000 eggs every time they spawn and they can spawn several times a year.                 "While adult fish are chasing off other fish, younger gobies will eat eggs in sunfish or bass nests," said Dermott.

T1  - Making of a Name, The: The Inside Story of the Brands We Buy
AN  - 2135052932
AB  - How do brand names differ from other names, and what goes into making a good name great and a bad name ghastly? Knowing this can spell the difference between bankruptcy and marketplace triumph. In this indispensable guide, the authors share the secrets of successful brand names-how they've indelibly stamped cultures around the world; who makes them; why they're made; and how they're compiled, bought, sold, and protected. The book outlines what kind of names exist-the initialized, descriptive, allusive, and coined. How namers surf on brainwaves. The do's, don'ts, and nevers of naming, how the structure of names is built from the ground up and how their sounds are engineered. Why names symbolize benefits. Where in the world brands may be found, and what will become of them. Fast-paced, illustration-packed, gazing at the past and probing into the future, this is the definitive book on naming. "The Making of A Name" is the one book anyone interested in "owned words" must have. "Right now, all over America, millions of freelancers are starting companies, inventing products and marketing their services.; Whether they're laid-off dot-com kids or unfulfilled Boomers, they have one thing in common-they all need names. Sadly for them, there's no book on the market that lays out the process. Rivkin and Sutherland's book will fill that gap. It's packed with useful 'how to' as well as tales both inspiring and cautionary: back-stories on the brand names we know-and whywe love or hate them.

AB  - Emotional Expression and Health looks at the role emotional expression and inhibition may play in staying healthy or falling ill. Written by leading experts in the field, chapters focus on: * how we can measure emotional expression or inhibition and how we can distinguish between their various facets * the role of attachment, and development of emotional information processing * alexithymia, emotional suppression, deception, emotional disclosure, defensiveness, repression, psychological mindedness, and emotional intelligence and self-efficacy. This unique approach will be of interest to all those in the fields of health and medical psychology and psychiatry, and behavioural medicine, as well as professionals working with patients in whom emotional expression or inhibition may play a role in a disease's etiology, course, or prognosis.

T1  - American eel on danger list: [Final Edition]
AN  - 354640092
AB  - Speaking to a group of Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources employees at MNR's Peterborough headquarters, Dr. [John Casselman] outlined the plight of the eel. Earlier this week Ontario's natural resources minister David Ramsay announced plans to close both the commercial and sport harvest of eels in Ontario and to help find ways for eels to safely pass through dams and turbines on the St. Lawrence River as they head down river for the Sargasso Sea to spawn.

              
   The American eel has been harvested for centuries by aboriginal peoples along the St. Lawrence in a system of traps called weirs. Ontario's commercial harvest of eels (a delicacy in Europe) peaked at about 500,000 pounds in 1978 and remained stable at 228,000 to 273,000 pounds between 1984 and 1993. But since then, Dr. Casselman says, the commercial harvest has declined precipitously to less than 30,000 pounds in 2003. Since 1998, the number of eels reaching the ladder around the Moses Saunders dam at Cornwall has dropped from a million a year (early 1980s) to fewer than 3,500 per year.

              
   In addition to Ontario (and New York state) plans to close the eel harvest, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the maritime provinces are working to develop a plan to protect eels. There is an inter-state initiative in the U.S. to protect eels and the Atlantic coastal states are seeking to have the eel designated under the U.S. endangered species act.

T1  - Garden Insects of North America:&nbsp;The Ultimate Guide to Backyard Bugs
AN  - 2131836080
AB  - Garden Insects of North America is the most comprehensive and user-friendly guide to the common insects and mites affecting yard and garden plants in North America. In a manner no previous book has come close to achieving, through full-color photos and concise, clear, scientifically accurate text, it describes the vast majority of species associated with shade trees and shrubs, turfgrass, flowers and ornamental plants, vegetables, and fruits--1,420 of them, including crickets, katydids, fruit flies, mealybugs, moths, maggots, borers, aphids, ants, bees, and many, many more. For particularly abundant bugs adept at damaging garden plants, management tips are also included. Covering all of the continental United States and Canada, this is the definitive one-volume resource for amateur gardeners, insect lovers, and professional entomologists alike. To ease identification, the book is organized by plant area affected (e.g., foliage, flowers, stems) and within that, by taxa. Close to a third of the species are primarily leaf chewers, with about the same number of sap suckers. Multiple photos of various life stages and typical plant symptoms are included for key species. The text, on the facing page, provides basic information on host plants, characteristic damage caused to plants, distribution, life history, habits, and, where necessary, how to keep "pests" in check--in short, the essentials to better understanding, appreciating, and tolerating these creatures. Whether managing, studying, or simply observing insects, identification is the first step--and this book is the key. With it in hand, the marvelous microcosm right outside the house finally comes fully into view. Describes more than 1,400 species--twice as many as in any other field guide Full-color photos for most species--more than five times the number in most comparable guides Up-to-date pest management tips Organized by plant area affected and by taxa for easy identification Covers the continental United States and Canada Provides species level treatment of all insects and mites important to gardens Illustrates all life stages of key garden insects and commonly associated plant injuries Concise, clear, scientifically accurate text Comprehensive and user-friendly

T1  - Germanic Standardizations:&nbsp;Past to Present
AN  - 2131974984
AB  - This volume presents a comparative, socio-historical study of the Germanic standard languages (Afrikaans, Danish, Dutch, English, Faroese, Frisian, German, Icelandic, Low German, Luxemburgish, Norwegian, Scots, Swedish, Yiddish as well as the Caribbean and Pacific Creole languages). Each of the 16 orginal chapters systematically discusses central aspects of the standardization process, including dialect selection, codification, elaboration and diffusion of the standard norm across the speech community, as well as incipient processes of de-standardization and re-standardization. The strongly comparative orientation of the contributions allow for the identification of broad similarities as well as intriguing differences across a wide range of historically and socially diverse language histories. Two chapters by the editors provide an overview of the theoretical background and rationale of comparative standardization research, and outline directions for further research in the area. The volume will be of interest to language historians as well as sociolinguists in general.

T1  - Making the lakes great again: Situation looks bad but there's reason for optimism: [Final Edition]
AN  - 361254660
AB  - A binational citizens' group, Great Lakes United, has outlined a plan of action for a multitude of problems which it handed out to Great Lakes mayors attending a conference in St. Catharines this week.

              
   "(The lakes are) a biological resource I think we need," says Ron Hites of the Hites Laboratory for Analytical Environmental Chemistry at Indiana University. "The fish from the oceans are in trouble. The fact we can't use fish out of the Great Lakes is significant. And the reason we can't is largely because of these toxic compounds. I think it's an issue. Now the problem is what do you do about it?"

              
   "I don't see on either side of the lakes an over-arching image of the great lakes as an ecosystem," [David Suzuki] says.

"[The bill] is a lot of money, but it is a critical investment. As those of us from the Great Lakes know, the economic damage that invasive species can cause is much greater."

T1  - Lack of fish, water but not algae put stress on Great Lakes: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359334257
AB  - "I would say that irreparable damage has already been done and continues to be done," says [Gary Gulezian], director of the Great Lakes National Program Office in Chicago. "The lakes are changing and will continue to change and that is an unpredictable factor."                 Invasive species enter the lakes mainly by hitching a ride in the ballast tanks of ocean-going ships. Those ships are inspected for foreign ballast water by American authorities at Massena, N.Y., as they head into the St. Lawrence Seaway. Canada has no such inspection framework anywhere in the Great Lakes. Moreover, the United States has a National Aquatic Invasive Species Act that is currently being revised in Congress. Canada has no similar legislation.                 While saying there are weaknesses in American and Canadian efforts, [Johanne Gelinas] said she found the three Canadian federal departments mandated to protect the Great Lakes -- Fisheries and Oceans, Environment Canada and Transport Canada -- are unfocused, have no established priorities and are involved in a buck-passing game she likened to ping pong. As a result, regulatory measures develop at an almost glacial pace.

Those ships are inspected for foreign ballast water by American authorities at Massena, New York, as they head into the St. Lawrence Seaway. Canada has no such inspection framework anywhere in the Great Lakes. Moreover, the United States has a National Aquatic Invasive Species Act that is currently being revised in Congress.

Few people realize that a primary cause of the collapse of those societies has been the destruction of the environmental resources on which they depended.

It describes how politicization--whether by misapplication, overextension, or outright manipulation of the scientific record to advance particular policy agendas--imposes expenditures of money, missed opportunities, and burdens on the economy.

T1  - Muskie on rise in Lake St.Clair Claire: Smallmouth bass and perch also in abundance: [Final Edition]
AN  - 352860841
AB  - Don MacLennan, a biologist with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, told an anglers' meeting Wednesday that more than 7,000 muskie were taken last summer from the Ontario side of the lake.

              
   MacLennan said more than 24 per cent of anglers on Lake St. Clair are now fishing for bass. There has also been a three-fold increase in the number of anglers fishing for perch.

              
   "Changes in the Lake Erie environment, caused by such factors as introductions of new aquatic species and climate-change, threaten to disrupt the fragile ecological balance and undercut the success of the world-class fishery," said Mike Morencie of the MNR.

T1  - The Role of Calcium and Comparable Cations in Animal Behaviour
AN  - 2130860506
AB  - Calcium and comparable cations are fast being recognised for their role as vital components of animal physiology. When trying to answer questions such as why salmon can adjust to life in fresh water as well as seawater, or why chilli peppers taste hot to humans but evoke little response from chickens, we often find the answers lie in patterns of movement of these ions and their roles in sensing, transmitting and collecting messages. Bringing together scattered literature on calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium in biology, this book examines important biological contributions of these ions including enzyme activation, effects in all types of muscle and biomineralization. Attention is focused on: channel construction and ion movement; calcium as a second messenger and in the construction of solids and ion channelopathies, with the help of personalities such as Agatha Christie, van Gogh and Captain Cook. The Role of Calcium and Comparable Cations in Animal Behaviour will be valued by a wide-range of readers including students of bioinorganic chemistry and animal behavioural studies, teachers and other professionals in academia.Calcium and comparable cations are fast being recognised for their role as vital components of animal physiology.

T1  - Digging up the facts on Seaway dredging: [Final Edition]
AN  - 353808442
AB  - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) has proposed to the U.S. and Canadian governments that the channels be deepened and widened to allow larger international ships to come up through the Seaway.

              
   Although regulations indicated ballast-on-board ships must exchange their ballast water at sea, 80 per cent of the ocean ships are not ballast-on-board ships.

              
   These ships take on lake water as ballast as they unload their cargo; when they take on cargo at another port, they discharge the ballast water which could contain pathogens and diseases.

T1  - New underwater adventures for divers in Lake Erie: [Final Edition]
AN  - 354638161
AB  - Over the last two decades, pollutants that turned Lake Erie into an environmental mess have decreased dramatically, opening a new underwater world to divers. They come to explore the skeletal remains of dozens of shipwrecks that are strewn throughout the lake. Even those wrecks dating to the early 1900s are well preserved because there's no salt in the water.

              
   Interest in diving Lake Erie is increasing, and Ohio is working to establish a shipwreck preserve to encourage diving and tourism. The preserve is to ring Kelleys Island, about 15 kilometres south of Pelee Island, and cover 100 square kilometres.

The preserve is to ring Kelleys Island, about 15 kilometres south of Pelee Island, and cover 100 square kilometres.

T1  - Botulism feared to be spreading to Lake Ontario: [Final Edition]
AN  - 270122549
AB  - Scientists in Canada and the United States are keeping a close eye on Lake Ontario this summer as thousands of dead fish and birds continue to wash up on the shores of Lake Erie.                 For the third consecutive year, fish and bird carcasses have littered beaches along Lake Erie on both sides of the border, leading researchers to believe a potentially deadly toxin, created by type E botulism, is to blame.                 Jeff Robinson, a biologist with Environment Canada, said this epidemic appears to be travelling east and is poised to hit Lake Ontario by autumn -- a serious threat to any wildlife that travels south for the winter via Lake Ontario.

T1  - Botulism found in dead fish, birds: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359391408
AB  - [Jeff Robinson] says the dead birds being found are typically birds which eat fish or scavenge dead fish. He says the highest incidence of dead birds and dead fish seem to be in areas where the populations of round gobies are peaking.                 As for what to do with the dead fish and birds, he says burying them, like [Paul Steigerwald] and [Chase Edmonson] have, is probably the best approach to take. He also says the toxin is in the fish and not in the water itself, so people can still swim in it.              Colour Photo: A form of Botulism, a paralytic neurotoxin which is naturally occurring on the bottom of Lake Erie, and the other Great Lakes, is bottom feeders, including sheephead, carp and catfish./ Staff photo ; Colour Photo: Dave Johnson, Tribune / Chase Edmonson buries dead fish which have been washing up along the shores of Lake Erie in the Reeb's Bay area.

T1  - Heart Disease:&nbsp;Environment, Stress and Gender
AN  - 2131356294
AB  - Why do men get more heart disease than women? Recent global trends in heart disease show that traditional coronary risk factors, such as elevated blood pressure and cholesterol are poor candidates in explaining the gender gap in heart disease. Changes in these risk factors also cannot explain the recent cardiovascular disease epidemic among middle-aged men in Eastern Europe. This book focuses on environmental, behavioural, and psychosocial variables, as well as new risk factors of a biological nature in an attempt to understand the gender gap in heart disease. It combines perspectives from numerous disciplines, such as demography, epidemiology, medicine, nutrition, sociology, and psychology to explore the environmental, behavioural, and psychosocial influences on men's greater susceptibility to heart disease.

AB  - Spills of Emulsified Fuels: Risks and Response is part of an evolving body of work conducted by the National Research Council (NRC) to help inform debate and decision-making regarding the ecological consequences of releases associated with the widespread use of fossil fuels. Like earlier NRC reports, it attempts to understand the chemical, physical, and biological behavior of a complex mix of compounds that make up various petroleum hydrocarbon-based fuels. The specific risk factors presented by emulsified fuels are difficult to characterize, mainly because there have been no spills of emulsified fuels to date, and thus there is little practical experience with these products.

T1  - Abrupt Climate Change:&nbsp;Inevitable Surprises
AN  - 2131086490
AB  - The climate record for the past 100,000 years clearly indicates that the climate system has undergone periodic--and often extreme--shifts, sometimes in as little as a decade or less. The causes of abrupt climate changes have not been clearly established, but the triggering of events is likely to be the result of multiple natural processes. Abrupt climate changes of the magnitude seen in the past would have far-reaching implications for human society and ecosystems, including major impacts on energy consumption and water supply demands. Could such a change happen again? Are human activities exacerbating the likelihood of abrupt climate change? What are the potential societal consequences of such a change? Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises looks at the current scientific evidence and theoretical understanding to describe what is currently known about abrupt climate change, including patterns and magnitudes, mechanisms, and probability of occurrence. It identifies critical knowledge gaps concerning the potential for future abrupt changes, including those aspects of change most important to society and economies, and outlines a research strategy to close those gaps. Based on the best and most current research available, this book surveys the history of climate change and makes a series of specific recommendations for the future.

Could such a change happen again? Are human activities exacerbating the likelihood of abrupt climate change? What are the potential societal consequences of such a change?
 
 
Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises looks at the current scientific evidence and theoretical understanding to describe what is currently known about abrupt climate change, including patterns and magnitudes, mechanisms, and probability of occurrence. It identifies critical knowledge gaps concerning the potential for future abrupt changes, including those aspects of change most important to society and economies, and outlines a research strategy to close those gaps.
 
 Based on the best and most current research available, this book surveys the history of climate change and makes a series of specific recommendations for the future.

T1  - Spiny water flea may frustrate anglers, lower cottage values: [Final Edition]
AN  - 354528995
AB  - TORONTO (CP) -- A tiny water flea, less than a centimetre in length, may cause major headaches for anglers and cottagers in central Canada this summer as the latest invasive species makes inroads into inland lakes.

              
   The spiny water flea, native to the waters around Great Britain and the Caspian Sea, was first spotted in the Great Lakes in the 1980s, likely brought across the ocean in ships' ballast water.

T1  - Trouble in walleye paradise: [Final Edition]
AN  - 355556757
AB  - The sought-after walleye population has nose-dived because of these changing environmental conditions, aided and abetted by commercial fishing, a First Nations spear and gill-net fishery and sports anglers taking their legal quota.                 Bay of Quinte walleye bring in a large and important economic contribution to the area, and the hotels, motels, restaurants, marina and charter-boat operations are going to suffer if the anglers stop coming.                 Even now and again you get a well-deserved nudge in a politically correct direction. First reaction is resentment, then a realization that you've known it for years, and then grudging acknowledgement that you're smart enough to know that you shouldn't have been doing it anyway. April White, a wildlife awareness officer with the Canadian Wildlife Service was staffing a booth at the Spring Fishing Show. She was taking lead weights, jigs and split shot off people and exchanging the lead for bismuthor tin equivalents.

T1  - Force shipping vessels to clean up their act: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349332113
AB  - Most of them arrived after 1956, when the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway allowed ocean-going freighters to travel as far as Lake Superior. In most cases, they came here in ballast tanks; the freighters filled up in freshwater bodies at their ports of origin and emptied the tanks when they arrived here. As a consequence, those organisms which survived the ocean voyage -- the most aggressive creatures in the tanks -- were dumped into the Great Lakes waters.

              
   The biggest problem right now is the disruption of the natural order of things in our Great Lakes. Scientists are becoming aware of the damage caused by these new organisms, but they haven't yet been able to assess the possible harm that could be wrought by parasites or diseases which these organisms may introduce -- against which our native species will have no resistance.

T1  - Great Lakes cleanup gets mediocre grade ; Good and bad news on chemical contaminants: [Ontario Edition]
AN  - 438331176
AB  - Progress in cleaning up the Great Lakes gets a lukewarm evaluation in a new report from Canadian and U.S. environmental agencies.                 Shear is dismayed by the continuing loss of wetlands throughout the Great Lakes basin and the increasing amount of "hardening" of shorelines, the practise of building concrete walls and other barriers to prevent erosion.                 The International Joint Commission, a Canada/U.S. body that oversees Great Lakes and other boundary water issues, postponed indefinitely its biennial meeting that was to start Friday.

T1  - Practical Design of Ships and Other Floating Structures:&nbsp;Eighth International Symposium - PRADS 2001 (2 Volume Set)
AN  - 2131158975
AB  - This proceedings contains the papers presented at The 8th International Symposium on Practical Design of Ships and Other Floating Structures held in China in September 2001 - the first PRADS of the 21st Century. The overall aim of PRADS symposia is to advance the design of ships and other floating structures as a professional discipline and science by exchanging knowledge and promoting discussion of relevant topics in the fields of naval architecture and marine and offshore engineering. In line with the aim, in welcoming the new era, this Symposium is intended to increase international co-operation and give a momentum for the new development of design and production technology of ships and other floating structures for efficiency, economy, safety, and environmental production. The main themes of this Symposium are Design Synthesis, Production, Hydrodynamics, Structures and Materials of Ships and Floating Systems. Proposals for over 270 papers from 26 countries and regions within the themes were received for PRADS 2001, and about 170 papers were accepted for presentation at the symposium. With the high quality of the proposed papers the Local Organising Committee had a difficult task to make a balanced selection and to control the total number of papers for fitting into the allocated time schedule approved by the Standing Committee of PRADS. Volume I covers design synthesis, production and part of hydrodynamics. Volume II contains the rest of hydrodynamics, and structures and materials.

T1  - Genes, Categories, and Species:&nbsp;The Evolutionary and Cognitive Cause of the Species Problem
AN  - 2135027255
AB  - In Genes, Categories and Species, Jody Hey provides an enlightening new solution to one of biology's most ironic and perplexing puzzles. When Darwin showed that life evolves, and that it does so by natural selection, he transformed our understanding of living things. But the very question Darwin addressed-the nature of species-continues to pose an awkward conundrum for biologists. Despite enormous efforts by a great many scholars, biologists still cannot agree on how to identify species or even how to define the word species. Genes, Categories, and Species is not like other books on the species problem, for it does not begin by asking, What is a species? Instead, it focuses on the very fact that biologists are stumped by species and their curious behavior in coping with that uncertainty. Faced with a persistent conundrum-and no lack of data on the subject-biologists who ponder the species problem have ceased to ask the most essential of scientific questions: What new information do we need to resolve the problem? This is the question that motivates this book and leads to the discoveries it reveals. The answer to the species problem lies not with the processes and patterns of biological diversity, Hey contends, but rather in the way the human mind perceives and categorizes that diversity. The promise of this book is twofold. First, it allows biologists to understand the causes of the species problem and to use this knowledge to avoid the major confusions that arise over species. Second, with its explanation of the species problem, it gives scholars and students of human nature a humbling example of how ill-suited the human mind is for certain kinds of scientific questions.a"

T1  - Beetlemania in Fonthill: Tiny insects imported to battle purple loosestrife: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349232009
AB  - Glen Meyers hopes these troops, taking the form of thousands of Galerucella beetles, will help restore the natural vegetation on his Fonthill property which has been overrun by purple loosestrife.

              
   That was in 1995 and [Donna MacKenzie], whose private firm specializes in using the beetles to fight purple loosestrife, said the bugs have been used across Ontario.

              
Color Photo: Special to the Standard / The beetle being released in Niagara to combat the purple loosestrife weed. ; Color Photo: Denis Cahill, The Standard / Glen Meyers watches as Donna MacKenzie leaves her little bugs around his rural garden in Fonthill.

T1  - Wetlands and waterfowl: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349085340
AB  - Long Point is known to shelter and feed 25 species of waterfowl, including as many as 13,000 tundra swans, which stop to rest and feed during their long migrations. Recognized internationally for its value to wildfowl, Long Point has been designated as a world biosphere reserve by UNESCO and a Globally Important Bird Area by Birdlife International. Among its research projects is the study of tundra swan migration routes by radio-tracking, the continental decline of scaup ducks and black duck populations and the invasion of a plant species inhospitable to waterfowl.

              
   Most spectacular of the present research subjects are the graceful tundra swans, which have tripled in population since the fifties. Seen locally in flocks of hundreds as they work their way northward, Long Point visitors are thrilled by literally thousands of the huge, snow-white birds. Dr.Petrie and his research staff pioneered the radio-tracking of tundra swans and the information gathered has been quite astounding.

T1  - A never-ending spew of toxic water: For decades, scientists have known that cargo ships, which empty and fill their ballast tanks with water for balance, have been transporting exotic and harmful species around the world. Yet, as the flow gets worse, there is still no solution in sight, writes Philip Lee.: [Final Edition]
AN  - 240423345
AB  - Recently, there have been reports that bacteria and viruses are being transported in ballast water. This fall, researchers at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Maryland, published a paper in the scientific journal, Nature, reporting on a project that discovered a multitude of micro-organisms in ballast water in ships entering Chesapeake Bay, including Vibrio cholera, the bacteria that causes cholera in humans. Chesapeake Bay alone receives 10 billion litres of foreign ballast water each year. Vibrio cholera was found in ballast samples in all ships tested by Smithsonian researchers.                 The Smithsonian study wasn't the first time cholera bacteria had been linked to ballast water. Nine years ago, when oysters in Mobile Bay, Alabama, tested positive for cholera bacteria, scientists discovered ballast water in three ships in the area also contained cholera bacteria. These ships had recently visited South America, where there had been an outbreak of cholera, which itself was also linked to ship ballast water.                 The United States now requires ships to report how they are handling their ballast to a National Ballast Water Clearing House established in conjunction with the coast guard at the Smithsonian Center. This fall, the Clearing House reported that only 20 per cent of the ships entering U.S. waters were reporting as required by law. Of the ships that did report an intention to discharge ballast water in U.S. waters, only about 20 per cent had undergone a complete mid- ocean ballast exchange.

T1  - The Encyclopedia of Louisville
AN  - 2131953576
AB  - With more than 1,800 entries, The Encyclopedia of Louisville is the ultimate reference for Kentucky's largest city. For more than 125 years, the world's attention has turned to Louisville for the annual running of the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May. Louisville Slugger bats still reign supreme in major league baseball. The city was also the birthplace of the famed Hot Brown and Benedictine spread, and the cheeseburger made its debut at Kaelin's Restaurant on Newburg Road in 1934. The "Happy Birthday" had its origins in the Louisville kindergarten class of sisters Mildred Jane Hill and Patty Smith Hill. Named for King Louis XVI of France in appreciation for his assistance during the Revolutionary War, Louisville was founded by George Rogers Clark in 1778. The city has been home to a number of men and women who changed the face of American history. President Zachary Taylor was reared in surrounding Jefferson County, and two U.S. Supreme Court Justices were from the city proper. Second Lt. F. Scott Fitzgerald, stationed at Camp Zachary Taylor during World War I, frequented the bar in the famous Seelbach Hotel, immortalized in The Great Gatsby. Muhammad Ali was born in Louisville and won six Golden Gloves tournaments in Kentucky.

T1  - Beware stowaway organisms: [Final Edition]
AN  - 345719687
AB  - One of the most common methods of transportation for foreign species today is in cargo ships, particularly in ballast water. Ships pick up ballast

              
   Perhaps most disturbing is the incredible number of microorganisms found in ballast water. A recent study published in the journal Nature reported that each litre of ballast water tested from ships in Chesapeake Bay contained about a billion bacteria and up to seven billion virus-like particles. The bacteria Vibrio cholerae 01 and 0139, which cause the deadly human disease cholera, were found in 93 per cent of the samples tested.

              
   Some ports, like Vancouver, BC, have regulations requiring foreign ships to discharge ballast water at sea before entering the harbour, but many others do not. Furthermore, discharge alone does not remove all the organisms from the water, and if conditions are rough, ships don't have to obey the regulation for safety reasons. Currently, billions of litres of foreign ballast water are still finding their way into ports across North America, but there are few studies on the fate of the vast number of foreign microorganisms hitchhiking with it.

T1  - Ballast water harbours billions of life forms: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359146891
AB  - One of the most common methods of transportation for foreign species today is in cargo ships, particularly in ballast water. Ships pick up ballast water at their points of origin to help stabilize the huge vessels on their long journeys overseas. But once the crew reaches their destination, they often dump this water into the local harbour. The United States alone receives 79 million tonnes of ballast water from overseas locations every year. Chesapeake Bay on the US east coast receives 10 billion litres of it annually.                 Perhaps most disturbing is the incredible number of microorganisms found in ballast water. A recent study published in the journal Nature reported that each litre of ballast water tested from ships in Chesapeake Bay contained about a billion bacteria and up to seven billion virus-like particles. The bacteria Vibrio cholerae 01 and 0139, which cause the deadly human disease cholera, were found in 93 per cent of the samples tested.                 The authors conclude that, "the transfer and release of V. cholerae by ships creates an opportunity for the colonization of coastal ecosystems." V. cholerae has been known to survive in seawater for more than 50 days and ballast water containing V. cholerae emptied into Peruvian ports is the probable cause of the outbreak of cholera in Peru in 1991 that killed 3,000 people.

T1  - Primacy of Movement
AN  - 2130932559
AB  - Through diligent and rigorous attention to both natural history and phenomenological accounts of kinetic phenomena, particularly the phenomenon of self-movement, this richly interdisciplinary book brings to the fore the long-neglected topic of animate form and with it, a long-neglected inquiry into the significance of animation. It addresses methodological and foundational issues at length. In its detailed and extensive examinations and analyses of movement — which range from Aristotle’s recognition of motion as 
the principle of nature to a critique of the common notion of movement as change of position, from critiques of present-day materialists’ trivializations of movement as mere output to kinesthetically-tethered accounts of the qualia of movement, from expositions of an evolutionary semantics and of the tactile-kinesthetic body as generative source of corporeal concepts to expositions of thinking in movement and of the pan-human phenomenon of learning to move oneself — this book lays out in ground-breaking ways fundamental epistemological and metaphysical dimensions of animate life.

T1  - The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Literature in English
AN  - 2131201748
AB  - This new Oxford Companion is the first comprehensive reference source for 20th-century literature in English from all round the world. It offers information on all significant international writers in English and their works: from America, the United Kingdom, and Australia, from Canada and New Zealand, India and Ireland, Africa and the Caribbean. Far more inclusive than any of its rivals, the book is alphabetically arranged, up to date, and cross-referenced throughout. -;This is a unique new reference book to English-language writers and writing throughout the present century, in all major genres and from all around the world - from Joseph Conrad to Will Self, Virginia Woolf to David Mamet, Ezra Pound to Peter Carey, James Joyce to Amy Tan. The survivors of the Victorian age who feature in The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Literature in English - writers such as Thomas Hardy, Olive Schreiner, Rabindranath Tagore, Henry James - could hardly have imagined how richly diverse Literature in English' would become by the end of the century. Fiction, plays, poetry, and a whole range of non-fictional writing are celebrated in this informative, readable, and catholic reference book, which includes entries on literary. movements, periodicals, and over 400 individual works, as well as articles on some 2,400 authors. All the great literary figures are included, whether American or Australian, British, Irish, or Indian, African or Canadian or Caribbean - among them Samuel Beckett, Edith Wharton, Patrick White, T. S. Eliot, Derek Walcott, D. H. Lawrence, Tennessee Williams, Vladimir Nabokov, Wole Soyinka, Sylvia Plath - as well as a wealth of less obviously canonical writers, from Ana--iuml--;s Nin to L. M. Montgomery, Bob Dylan to Terry Pratchett. The book comes right up to date with contemporary figures such. as Toni Morrison, Ben Okri, Salman Rushdie, Carol Shields, Tim Winton, Nadine Gordimer, Vikram Seth, Don Delillo, and many others. Title entries range from Aaron's Rod to The Zoo Story; topics from Angry Young Men, Bestsellers, and Concrete Poetry to Soap Opera, Vietnam Writing, and Westerns. A lively introduction by John Sutherland highlights the various and sometimes contradictory canons that have emerged over the century, and the increasingly international sources of writing in English which the Companion records. Catering for all literary tastes, this is the most comprehensive single-volume guide to modern (and postmodern) literature. -

AB  - In Beyond Intellectual Property, authors Darrell A. Posey and Graham Dutfield listen and respond to this voice. They offer sound and reasonable advice on how indigenous peoples and local communities worldwide should approach and deal with the myriad of issues surrounding intellectual property and traditional resource rights. For indigenous peoples' groups, activists and policymakers in intellectual property, and all those concerned with the preservation of our planet's biological and cultural diversity, Beyond Intellectual Property provides an invaluable and eye-opening look into one of the most provocative and explosive issues of this century and likely the next: the patenting of life.

T1  - Ministry was better in bygone days: [MET Edition]
AN  - 437100308
AB  - * It's no saner south of the border, where the government has hatched a controversial plan to introduce Canadian timber wolves to Yellowstone Park and Central Idaho. That's despite an Environmental Impact Study that estimates the Yellowstone pack will kill 19 cattle, 68 sheep and 1,200 big game animals each year, while the Idaho annual toll will be 10 cattle, 57 sheep and 1,650 big-game animals. John Power is a freelance outdoors writer/consultant and member of a number of conservation organizations, including Ducks Unlimited, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters and the Canadian Wildlife Federation. His column normally appears Wednesday and Saturday.

T1  - Flawed management practices only mirror waterfowl crises: [AM Edition]
AN  - 436872367
AB  - [Cecil Bell] points out that Ducks Unlimited and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have spent 90 per cent of their resources on public lands, while 90 per cent of waterfowl are raised on small wetlands located on private property. Yet the plan contains no meaningful approach to critical agricultural relationships.                 He charges that architects of the waterfowl plan have turned a blind eye to predation, which flies in the face of the facts. There is no predator program, despite a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service report which notes it has invested millions for production habitat on the U.S. prairies, yet returns are minimal because of predators.                 Pot shots: The watchdog that barked but couldn't bite because it had no teeth has been euthanized. The Ontario Fisheries Advisory Council, chaired by esteemed ichthyologist Dr. E.J. Crossman, has been canned by the provincial government. Just as well, because it became redundant when its recommendations on fisheries policy, management and licence revenue spending fell on deaf ears.

T1  - Loosestrife threat Grimsby pupils wage war on nasty invading weed: [Final Edition]
AN  - 269688910
AB  - The pupils from grades 4 to 8 are drawn from five Niagara elementary schools. They took on the loosestrife about two years ago as part of a real-life problem-solving exercise, said Ms [Norrie Franko], who runs the West End County Gifted Classes program for the school board.                 Other pupils in Ms Franko's class have been writing local municipalities to ask councils to deem the plant a noxious weed which should be destroyed.                 Her pupils' work garnered them a nomination last year for an environmental award from the Niagara Conservation Authority. Although the pupils didn't win that award they have won a "Hoot' award from Toronto-based Owl magazine -- an environmental publication for children. The pupils are waiting to see what this award is, Ms Franko said.

T1  - Stop playing God with the little fishies: [AM Edition]
AN  - 436684338
AB  - On the surface, stocking the Great Lakes seems like a good idea. People like to see something to show for the money spent on the cleanup of the lakes. Tourist towns in Ontario and Michigan were revived by the big-spending fishermen who began to arrive in the late 1960s, looking for rainbow trout, pacific salmon and smelt.                 When the Atlantic salmon were killed off in Lake Ontario, they were replaced with rainbow trout and coho salmon. When the whitefish, herring, lake trout, blue pike and sturgeon of the Upper Lakes were poisoned and netted, fisheries departments introduced smelts, chinook salmon, splake and pink salmon.                 We're caught in a dangerous environmental game with the Great Lakes. We've hammered them by spewing poisons from our factories and towns. Now our tax dollars are being spent to attack them genetically for short-term gain. Tourism operators and fishermen may like the big, new trophy fish, but the stocking program has been a genetic assault on the lakes that will be hard to justify in the long term.

T1  - The Kentucky Encyclopedia
AN  - 2130872367
AB  - The Kentucky Encyclopedia's 2,000-plus entries are the work of more than five hundred writers. Their subjects reflect all areas of the commonwealth and span the time from prehistoric settlement to today's headlines, recording Kentuckians' achievements in art, architecture, business, education, politics, religion, science, and sports. Biographical sketches portray all of Kentucky's governors and U.S. senators, as well as note congressmen and state and local politicians. Kentucky's impact on the national scene is registered in the lives of such figures as Carry Nation, Henry Clay, Louis Brandeis, and Alben Barkley. The commonwealth's high range from writers Harriette Arnow and Jesse Stuart, reformers Laura Clay and Mary Breckinridge, and civil rights leaders Whitney Young, Jr., and Georgia Powers, to sports figures Muhammad Ali and Adolph Rupp and entertainers Loretta Lynn, Merle Travis, and the Everly Brothers. Entries describe each county and county seat and each community with a population above 2,500. Broad overview articles examine such topics as agriculture, segregation, transportation, literature, and folklife. Frequently misunderstood aspects of Kentucky's history and culture are clarified and popular misconceptions corrected. The facts on such subjects as mint juleps, Fort Knox, Boone's coonskin cap, the Kentucky hot brown, and Morgan's Raiders will settle many an argument. For both the researcher and the more casual reader, this collection of facts and fancies about Kentucky and Kentuckians will be an invaluable resource.
The Kentucky Encyclopedia is available on-line for libraries and other subscribers. See www.kyenc.com for information.

T1  - 'Dangerous' game farms breed disease, critics warn: [AM Edition]
AN  - 436554403
AB  - Earlier this month, 130 imported red deer - a larger, stronger relative of our own white-tail deer - were slaughtered in Owen Sound after they became infected with a deadly neurological parasite. The parasite, known as "muscle worm," has the potential to devastate our native populations of deer and moose, biologists say.                 In 1990, tuberculosis epidemics at a number of Alberta game farms resulted in the slaughter of more than 2,000 elk and red deer. And 10 Alberta cattle ranchers later tested positive for TB - an ominous sign, critics say.                 If these animals escape and establish themselves in the wild, ecological havoc can result when they compete with existing species. This has already occurred on a large scale in some U.S. states, where red deer have virtually eliminated the white-tail deer in certain areas.

T1  - A Great Lake rises from its grave Declared officially dead 25 years ago, Lake Erie shows real progress towards a partial recovery, thanks to heroic cleanup measures: [SA2 Edition]
AN  - 436429613
AB  - Aquatic biologist Paul Bertram of the Environmental Protection Agency, [Joseph Makarewicz]'s research associate, agreed: "Lake Erie was never dead. Lake Erie had too much life in it."                 As the populations of predatory fish expanded, they began consuming and dramatically reducing the numbers of alewives, perch and minnows in Lake Erie. The decrease in smaller fish numbers took the pressure off smaller, algae-eating zooplankton, such as water fleas, and the algae-eaters became much more abundant.                 "These things are like vacuum cleaners; they are very, very adept at grazing algae," Makarewicz said. So the combined result of less phosphorus and more game fish was that Lake Erie's water began clearing up.

T1  - The Greening of the Cities
AN  - 2131974798
AB  - First Published in 2004. The majority of our large manufacturing cities are in decline--thousands of acres of their former industrial greatness have become gigantic scrapheaps. New industries with new technologies no longer make it necessary to locate industry in cities, and social and fiscal pressures are drawing people out into the countryside. Thus a conflict is growing with cities dying for lack of industry and new housing-- whilst conservationists resist the spread of development into the green belts or further into the rural landscape. This book is an important contribution to a contemporary debate which is of significance to everyone living in Britain: the need for a land-use policy which looks simultaneously at the towns and country and strikes a balance between urban and rural renewal
