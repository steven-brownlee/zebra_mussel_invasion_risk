T1  - Evolutionary conservation and divergence of the transcriptional regulation of bivalve shell secretion across life history stages
AN  - 2653417221
AB  - Adult molluscs produce shells with diverse morphologies and ornamentations, different colour patterns and microstructures. The larval shell however, is a phenotypically more conserved structure. How do developmental and evolutionary processes generate varying diversity at different life history stages? Using live-imaging, histology, scanning electron microscopy and transcriptomic profiling, we have described shell development in a heteroconchian bivalve the Antarctic clam, Laternula elliptica and compared it to adult shell secretion processes in the same species. Adult downstream shell genes, such as those encoding extracellular matrix proteins and biomineralisation enzymes, were largely not expressed during shell development, and instead, a development-specific downstream gene repertoire was expressed. Upstream regulatory genes such as transcription factors and signalling molecules were conserved between developmental and adult shell secretion. Comparing heteroconchian transcriptomic data with recently reported pteriomorphian larval shell proteome data suggests that, despite being phenotypically more conserved, the downstream effectors constituting the larval shell tool-kit may be as diverse as that of adults. Overall, our new data suggests that a larval shell formed using development-specific downstream effector genes is a conserved and ancestral feature of the bivalve lineage, and possibly more broadly across the molluscs.

T1  - The Development of Novel Micro Paper-Based Analytical Devices for the Detection of Explosives
AN  - 2877957460
AB  - Colourimetric detection, a technique where explosives, constituent functional groups, and taggants may be identified by a change in colour of the reagent, is a rapid and accurate detection method of explosives in-field. However, this approach is presumptive, subjective and inherently relies on the user’s ability to distinguish colour changes. Paper-based analytical devices (PADs), using traditional colourimetric detection has overcome some of the limitations of using colourimetric detection alone, and a desirable technique for further development and application in-field.This thesis presents a method for the improved detection of explosives utilising a ‘universal’ paper-based analytical device by using traditional colourimetric detection with concomitant fluorescence quenching; where fluorescent chromophore emissions were diminished in the presence of nitro-containing compounds due to complex formation between the compound and fluorophore.In-situ and microfluidic PADs (µPADs), were designed and optimised to incorporate both colourimetric and fluorescence quenching reagents, used both independently or combined. In-situand µPADs were designed with two viewing wells per µPAD, and quantitative detection was achieved via a novel transmittance detector under both a white and a 310 nm LED light sources; referred throughout as the eBeagle v.3 detector.Pyrene and pyrene with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) formulations were found to have superior detection selectivity ranges of nitro-containing explosives compared to other tested fluorophores, detecting between 8 – 9 of the 16 nitro-containing explosives. The eBeagle v.3 detector compared had a detection range of 0.09 ± 0.05 mg – 5.29 ± 2.55 mg using pyrene and 0.22 ± 0.27 mg – 0.75 ± 0.17 mg using pyrene with SDS, respectively.Five out of nine tested traditional and unconventional colourimetric reagents for the detection of organic and inorganic explosives were feasible usingin-situor microfluidic PADs and were further optimised with pyrene. A ‘universal’ two well µPAD using two concomitantly colourimetric detection reagents was developed; 1) a pyrene-KOH mixture for the detection of eight nitro-containing explosives, and sub-classification of some tertiary nitro-aromatic explosives (tetryl, trinitrotoluene (TNT), and trinitrobenzene (TNB)), and 2) an ammonium titanyl oxalate and a variant of Griess reagent performed sequentially to determine the presence of hydrogen peroxide and nitrite-based explosives, respectively. This approach had an instrumental minimum detectable amount (MDA) range of 0.97 ± 0.85 mg – 1.66 ± 1.39 under white lighting conditions and 0.25 ± 0.12 mg – 0.83 ± 0.55 mg under UV lighting conditions.

T1  - Species sensitivity distribution of dichlorvos in surface water species
AN  - 2849989055
AB  - Dichlorvos is an organophosphorus insecticide frequently detected in surface waters all around the world. From an evaluation of the environmental quality concentrations (EQC) for dichlorvos in surface waters adopted by different countries, it was observed a wide variability among them. This is despite regulatory EQC-values are typically based on toxicity data and species sensitivity distribution (SSD) in all the investigated regulatory frameworks, and therefore should be similar. Hence, what is the cause of the differences between national and regional EQC-values? And, which ones will protect the aquatic fauna? These hypotheses were proposed to explain differences among SSDs based on the choice of toxicity data: (i) EQC values obtained from technical presentation (pure dichlorvos) will be higher than the estimated from dichlorvos formulation (containing other substances to improve the efficiency of the active principle), as they may include synergists; (ii) different taxa will have different sensitivities; (iii) data produced under different experimental conditions will severely affect the SSD. Regarding their capacity to protect the aquatic fauna the hypotheses were; iv) environmental concentration of dichlorvos represents a risk for aquatic organisms; and v) not all EQC-values are protective for the aquatic fauna. These were tested through a meta-analysis of toxicity data enabling the construction of SSD’s across technical and formulated dichlorvos and species of several taxa, and across literature and experimental data produced under analogous conditions. Finally, the EQC elaborated were compared with a meta-study on monitored environmental concentrations. The study suggested that technical dichlorvos increased toxicity compared to formulated products up to two-fold for arthropods. Species phylogeny affected sensitivity, but the SSD derived values used for setting regulatory concentrations were remarkably robust to the inclusion/exclusion of less sensitive species. The SSD results from the literature and experimental data were similar in the case of technical dichlorvos results. The regional differences in EQC values therefore most likely stem from political considerations on how to use SSDs to derive EQCs rather than from differences in SSDs. The experimental SSD defined a protective concentration of 6.5 ng L− 1 for 5% of the species, which is according to the European EQC, but one to two-fold lower than the limit values of the US, China, and Argentina.

T1  - A Socio-Hydrologic Assessment of Mountain Water Supply Vulnerability to Changing Snowmelt
AN  - 2771714113
AB  - Climate change is accelerating disconnects between snowmelt-driven water supply and downstream demand. Identifying what makes people and places vulnerable to these disconnects can improve understanding of present conditions and help anticipate future changes in water management. This dissertation seeks to understand the potential for increasing disconnects between downstream agriculturally productive regions and their primary water supply—higher elevation, mountainous (upland) environments. We do so by focusing on agriculturally productive regions in the western United States (US) that are heavily reliant on seasonal snowmelt-driven streamflow, and using interdisciplinary tools such as big data, conceptual modeling, social science, and computational hydrology to assess vulnerability from the source (mountains) to demand (agriculture) We find that a process-based framework isolating three dominant mechanisms linking snow to streamflow helps explain changes in snowmelt-driven streamflow in 537 upland catchments throughout the US. We then use a hydrogeological framework and optimized averaging in a subset of our initial 537 catchments, highlighting the critical and often overlooked role of groundwater contributions in high, arid, and deep mountain catchments. Equipped with a more robust understanding of surface water and groundwater supplies in the western US, we then quantify the benefits of adaptation to changing snow resources particularly in hay-dominated agriculturally productive systems with smaller declines in snow relative to reservoir storage. Finally, we derive a flexible approach for expanding vulnerability assessments beyond the mountains and show that robust consideration of multiple aspects of vulnerability requires better measures of the social value of water as well as demand.

T1  - Could Acidified Environments Intensify Illicit Drug Effects on the Reproduction of Marine Mussels?
AN  - 2771655423
AB  - The increasing oceanic uptake is a direct response to the increasing atmospheric burden of CO2. Oceans are experiencing both physical and biogeochemical changes. This increase in CO2 hosts in oceans promotes changes in pH and seawater chemistry that can modify the speciation of compounds, largely due to dependent element speciation on physicochemical parameters (salinity, pH, and redox potential). So, ocean acidification can trigger enhanced toxicity of illicit drugs to non-target marine organisms due to the combined effects of crack cocaine and low pH (from 8.3 to 7.0 pH values) on the reproduction of the marine mussel Perna perna. Fertilization rate and embryo–larval development were used as endpoints to assess the effects of crack-cocaine concentrations (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg L−1) and its association with pH values variation (8.3, 8.0, 7.5, and 7.0). The IC50 was calculated from the results of an embryo–larval assay in different methods of acidification (CO2 and HCl), which evidenced that HCl treatment was more toxic than CO2 treatment for the same drug concentrations. Results showed that the gametes of P. perna react to acidification when exposed to crack-cocaine concentration and pH reductions.

T1  - Trophic Transfer of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes at the Base of the Food Chain and Toxicological Response
AN  - 2756774628
AB  - The potential for trophic transfer of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was assessed using the green algae Tetraselmis suecica and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis in a series of laboratory experiments. Swanee River Natural Organic Matter (SRNOM)-dispersed SWCNTs were introduced into growing algal cultures. Light microscopical observations, confirmed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy, showed that SWCNT agglomerates adhered to the external algal cell walls and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) results suggested internalization. A direct effect of SWCNT exposure on the algae was a significant decrease in growth, expressed as chlorophyll a concentration and cell viability. Mussels, fed with algae in the presence of SWCNTs, led to significantly increased pseudofaeces production, indicating selective feeding. Nevertheless, histological sections of the mussel digestive gland following exposure showed evidence of SWCNT-containing algae. Furthermore, DNA damage and oxidative stress biomarker responses in the mussel haemocytes and gill tissue were significantly altered from baseline values and were consistent with previously observed responses to SWCNT exposure. In conclusion, the observed SWCNT-algal interaction demonstrated the potential for SWCNT entrance at the base of the food chain, which may facilitate their trophic transfer with potential consequences for human exposure and health.

T1  - Toxicity of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances to Aquatic Invertebrates, Planktons, and Microorganisms
AN  - 2756706647
AB  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), recognized worldwide as emerging pollutants, may pose a substantial threat to human health and our environment due to their stability, high concentrations, wide distribution, and easy accumulation. Ever since perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid were recognized by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the public has become increasingly concerned about potential contamination and the environmental risks associated with PFASs. Ubiquitous PFAS contamination of drinking water, groundwater, surface water, and sediment has been detected, especially in areas with rapid industrial and economic development. Its accumulation in living organisms and foods has accentuated the importance of investigations into aquatic organisms at the bottom of the food chain, as the stability and integrity of the food web as well as the population quantity and structure of the aquatic ecosystem may be affected. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the toxic and toxicity-related effects of PFASs on aquatic plankton, aquatic invertebrates and microorganisms, the characteristics of different target aquatic organisms in toxicity investigations, and a feasibility evaluation of PFAS substitutes to provide valuable suggestions for further utilization and regulation of PFASs and their substitutes.

T1  - Mass Spectrometry as an Analytical Tool for Detection of Microplastics in the Environment
AN  - 2756678652
AB  - Plastic particles smaller than 5 mm accumulate in aqueous, terrestrial, and atmospheric environments and their discovery has been a serious concern when it comes to eco-toxicology and human health risk assessment. In the following review, the potential of mass spectrometry (MS) for the detection of microplastic (MP) pollutants has been elaborately reviewed. The use of various mass spectrometric techniques ranging from gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatographic mass spectrometric (LC-MS) to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), including their variants, have been reviewed. The lapses in the detection system have been addressed and future recommendations proposed. The challenges facing microplastics and their detection have been discussed and future directions, including mitigation methods, have been presented.

T1  - Agrochemical Residues in Fish and Bivalves from Sepetiba Bay and Parnaiba River Delta, Brazil
AN  - 2748544896
AB  - Accumulation of pesticides has a harmful impact on the environment and human health. The main goal of this work was to develop a method to determine and quantify the residues of thirteen pesticides in edible fish and bivalves such as parati (Mugil curema), seabass (Centropomus ssp.), mullet (Mugil brasiliensis), clams (Anomalocardia brasiliana) and mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected from Sepetiba Bay and Parnaiba River Delta (Brazil) between 2019 and 2020. Matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) was used for extraction and quantification through gas chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The method was validated (linearity, accuracy and precision) for fatty fish (Salmo salar), lean fish (Mugil curema) and bivalves (Mytilus edulis). The survey found linear correlation coefficients (r) equal to or greater than 0.9 for almost all analytes. The relative standard deviations (RSD) of five replicates were less than 20% for almost all analytes at different concentrations in lean fish, fatty fish and bivalves. Most analytes showed satisfactory accuracy. Alachlor herbicide was found in samples of seabass, mussels, clams and parati with levels ranging between 0.55 to 420.39 μg kg−1 dw. Ethion was found in parati (maximum 211.22 μg kg−1 dw), mussels (15.1 μg kg−1 dw) and clams (maximum 44.50 μg kg−1 dw). Alachlor was found in clams (maximum 93.1 μg kg−1 dw), and bifenthrin was found in parati (maximum 43.4 μg kg−1 dw) and clams (maximum 42.21 μg kg−1 dw). The validated method was satisfactory for the determination of eleven pesticides in the fatty fish matrix, and thirteen pesticides in the samples of lean fish and bivalves. The presence of alachlor, ethion and bifenthrin stands out.

T1  - Impacts of Recreational Angling on Fish Population Recovery after a Commercial Fishing Ban
AN  - 2728462579
AB  - It is often assumed that recreational fishing has negligible influences on fish stocks compared to commercial fishing. However, for inland water bodies in densely populated areas, this assumption may not be supported. In this study, we demonstrate variable stock recovery rates among different fish species with similar life histories in a large productive inland freshwater ecosystem (Kaunas Reservoir, Lithuania), where previously intensive commercial fishing has been banned since 2013. We conducted over 900 surveys of recreational anglers from 2016 to 2021 to document recreational fishing catches and combined these catch estimates with drone and fishfinder device-based assessments of recreational fishing effort. Fish population recovery rates were assessed using a standardized catch-per-unit-effort time series in independent scientific surveys. We show that recreational fishing is slowing the recovery of predatory species, such as pikeperch Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758) and Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758. The estimated annual recreational catches for these species were 19 tons (min-max of 7–55 tons) and 9 tons (4–28), respectively, which was considerably higher than the average commercial catch before the fishery closure (10 and 1 tons, respectively). In contrast, the recovery of roach Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758), rarely caught by anglers (annual recreational catch of ca 3 tons compared to ca 100 tons of commercial catch), has been rapid, and the species is now dominating the ecosystem. Our study demonstrates that recreational fishing can have strong and selective impacts on fish species, reduce predator abundance, alter relative species composition and potentially change ecosystem state and dynamics.

T1  - Feeding Selectivity of Ruditapes philippinarum on Phytoplankton
AN  - 2728462490
AB  - A monthly survey of the feeding selectivity of Ruditapes philippinarum in the Yalu River Estuary in 2020–2021 was conducted using high-throughput sequencing identification and visual grading technology. The results showed that the most-dominant species in the water of the shellfish culture area and in the stomachs of R. philippinarum was Karlodinium veneficum in those years. The selectivity index (E) indicated that R. philippinarum avoided consuming Bacillariophyta, Chrysophyta and Cryptophyta throughout the year and preferentially consumed Dinophyta and Chlorophyta. In 2020, the annual average biomass of Dinophyta, Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Dictyochophyta, Cryptophyta and Chrysophyta in the stomach contents of R. philippinarum was 54:14:16:1:10:4; it was 41:12:28:0:1:17 in 2021. The annual average biomass ratio of picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton in the stomachs of R. philippinarum was 13:48:39 in 2020; it was 14:66:20 in 2021. R. philippinarum actively fed on nanophytoplankton and avoided picophytoplankton. Among the phytoplankton of different sizes and groups that R. philippinarum prefer to feed, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and organic phosphorus (DOP) have a significant negative effect on the nanophytoplankton community, pH has a positive effect on the Dictyochophyta community and COD and the inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (DI-N/P) have a significant positive effect on the Chlorophyta community.

T1  - Improvement of Water Quality by Light-Emitting Diode Illumination at the Bottom of a Field Experimental Pond
AN  - 2700748713
AB  - Remediation of water quality by stimulating algal photosynthesis using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has attracted attention, but few studies have examined this in outdoor freshwater environments. To understand the effects of LED illumination on water quality, the dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, pH, and electric conductivity were monitored over 5 months in three depressions with or without a red/blue LED light at the bottom of an experimental pond. The effects of the blue LED on water quality were evident in the period with less rainfall after the change of water quality to an equilibrium state; DO and pH were higher, and EC was lower for the blue LED than for the control. The diel changes of these variables were also lower for the blue LED. The effects of the red LED on DO and pH were also evident, but to a lesser extent compared to those of the blue LED. A vertical mixing of water associated with a nighttime cooling of the surface water was suggested by a rapid DO increase after a temperature decrease in the control. Such internal water circulation and an inflow of water after rainfall might have obscured the LED effects in the rainy period. The bottom water of the blue LED had a higher density and species richness of phytoplankton than that of the control at the end of the experiment. A lower density of phytoplankton and higher nutrient concentrations in the red LED might have been due to a higher density and feeding activity by zooplankton. Our results confirmed the applicability of LED illumination in stimulating algal photosynthesis, and in improving the oxygen condition of the bottom water in freshwater ponds.

T1  - Content of Pb and Zn in Sediments and Hydrobionts as Ecological Markers for Pollution Assessment of Freshwater Objects in Bulgaria—A Review
AN  - 2700708194
AB  - The purpose of this review is to describe the contents of Pb and Zn in sediments and hydrobionts as ecological markers for the pollution assessment of freshwater objects in Bulgaria, and the data are compared with other countries and regions. Symmetry was found regarding the levels of Zn in the sediment of the Ovcharitsa and Zhrebchevo dams, which were twice the MAC for arable land (Regulation № 3 of Bulgarian legislation). Symmetry was also observed between the results for Zn and Pb in the studied sediments, and the “favorites” in terms of content were the samples from Zhrebchevo Dam and, especially, from Ovcharitsa Dam. Asymmetry was established in the accumulation of Zn in the livers of carps inhabiting Topolnitsa Dam in comparison with these in Ovcharitsa Dam. A similar asymmetry was observed for lead. The analysis of the muscles and livers of the studied fish showed an asymmetry in the accumulation of zinc, and this process was more intense in the liver. Symmetry was found in the accumulation of Pb in the liver and muscle tissues of the carp from the studied water bodies.

T1  - Inorganic Nanomaterials versus Polymer-Based Nanoparticles for Overcoming Neurodegeneration
AN  - 2694044136
AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) affect a great number of people worldwide and also have a significant socio-economic impact on the aging population. In this context, nanomedicine applied to neurological disorders provides several biotechnological strategies and nanoformulations that improve life expectancy and the quality of life of patients affected by brain disorders. However, available treatments are limited by the presence of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier (B–CSFB). In this regard, nanotechnological approaches could overcome these obstacles by updating various aspects (e.g., enhanced drug-delivery efficiency and bioavailability, BBB permeation and targeting the brain parenchyma, minimizing side effects). The aim of this review is to carefully explore the key elements of different neurological disorders and summarize the available nanomaterials applied for neurodegeneration therapy looking at several types of nanocarriers. Moreover, nutraceutical-loaded nanoparticles (NPs) and synthesized NPs using green approaches are also discussed underling the need to adopt eco-friendly procedures with a low environmental impact. The proven antioxidant properties related to several natural products provide an interesting starting point for developing efficient and green nanotools useful for neuroprotection.

T1  - Influence of nutrient levels, travel time and light availability on phytoplankton chlorophyll-a concentrations in a neotropical river basin
TT  - Influencia dos níveis de nutrientes, tempo de viagem e disponibilidade de luz nas concentraçöes de clorofila-a fitoplanctônica em uma bacia de rio neotropical
AN  - 2679853602
AB  - Resumo: Objetivo: Um maior conhecimento sobre os fatores que influenciam a biomassa de fitoplancton em rios é importante para a caracterizaçâo da qualidade da água, bem como para prever os efeitos de mudanças ambientais destes ecossistemas. Este estudo quantificou as concentraçöes de clorofila-a na coluna de agua da bacia hidrográfica do rio Miranda - MS, situada na regiao oeste do Brasil, uma das principais formadoras do bioma Pantanal, para identificar as principais influencias na biomassa do fitoplâncton. Métodos: Temperatura, profundidade, velocidade de correnteza, turbidez, transparencia por Disco de Secchi, e concentraçöes de nutrientes, sólidos em suspensâo, e clorofila-a foram medidos a intervalos aproximadamente mensais, durante um ano, em cinco pontos do planalto e tres pontos na planicie. Relaçöes entre clorofila a e concentraçöes de nutrientes, tempo de viagem e disponibilidade de luz foram examinados. Resultados: Os niveis de nutrientes foram geralmente baixos, sendo oligo- a mesotrófico. Altas concentraçöes de sólidos em suspensâo foram encontradas (até aproximadamente 250 mg.L-1), especialmente na época chuvosa nos pontos no planalto. No planalto ocorreram baixas concentraçöes de clorofila-a, enquanto nos pontos da planicie, com exceçâo de um, ocorreram dois picos, no inverno (época seca) e no verâo (época chuvosa), de 4,9 e 2,4 pg.L'1, respectivamente, coincidindo com concentraçöes reduzidas de sólidos em suspensâo. Conclusoes: Os baixos niveis de nutrientes provavelmente estâo relacionados ao uso da terra, principalmente para pecuaria. As altas concentraçöes de sólidos devem estar relacionadas a degradaçâo da vegetaçâo nativa, especialmente da mata ciliar nas últimas décadas. O tempo de viagem de aproximadamente tres a quarto dias nos pontos de planalto, comparado ao tempo de aproximadamente dez dias nos pontos da planicie, podem ter sido um fator determinante na diminuiçâo da abundância de algas no planalto, enquanto a limitaçâo por luz poderia ter sido importante diminuindo o crescimento de algas na planicie.Alternate abstract:Aim: Knowledge of the factors influencing the biomass of phytoplankton in rivers is important with reference to the characterization of water quality and predicting the effects of environmental change on such ecosystems. The present study quantified the concentrations of chlorophyll-a in the water column of the Miranda River Basin, located in western Brazil, contributing to form the Pantanal Wetland, and attempted to identify the primary environmental influences on the phytoplankton biomass. Methods: Temperature, depth, current speed, turbidity, Secchi transparency and concentrations of nutrients, suspended solids and chlorophyll-a were measured at approximate monthly intervals during the course of a year, at five upland and three lowland sites. Relationships between chlorophyll-a and nutrient concentrations, travel times and light availability were examined. Results: Nutrient levels were generally low, being oligo- to mesotrophic. High levels of suspended solids were recorded (up to approximately 250 mg.L-1), especially in the rainy season at the upland sites. The latter showed low chlorophyll-a concentrations, while lowland sites, with the exception of one, showed two peaks, one in winter (dry season) and the other in summer (wet season), of 4.9 and 2.4qg.L-1, respectively, coincident with reduced concentrations of suspended solids. Conclusions: The low nutrient levels recorded may have been due to the main land use being cattle rearing. The high solids concentrations found may have been due to the degradation of native vegetation, especially riparian, that has occurred over the past decades. Travel times of approximately three to four days may have been a factor in retarding algal abundance in the upland sites, as opposed to approximately ten days in the lowland sites, where light limitation may have been a factor reducing algal growth.

T1  - Biocide vs. Eco-Friendly Antifoulants: Role of the Antioxidative Defence and Settlement in Mytilus galloprovincialis
AN  - 2679728006
AB  - Antifoulant paints were developed to prevent and reduce biofouling on surfaces immersed in seawater. The widespread use of these substances over the years has led to a significant increase of their presence in the marine environment. These compounds were identified as environmental and human threats. As a result of an international ban, research in the last decade has focused on developing a new generation of benign antifoulant paints. This review outlines the detrimental effects associated with biocide versus eco-friendly antifoulants, highlighting what are effective antifoulants and why there is a need to monitor them. We examine the effects of biocide and eco-friendly antifoulants on the antioxidative defence mechanism and settlement in a higher sessile organism, specifically the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. These antifoulants can indirectly assess the potential of these two parameters in order to outline implementation of sustainable antifoulants.

T1  - Phytoplankton Indicators in the Assessment of the Ecological Status of Two Reservoirs with Different Purposes in Southern Ukraine
AN  - 2679694484
AB  - A comparison of two closely located reservoirs on the Southern Bug River and its tributary in the southern region of Ukraine is carried out. One of them (Tashlyk reservoir on a small river, tributary of the Southern Bug River) is a cooling reservoir (pond) for the nuclear power plant, the other (Alexandrovskoye reservoir, on the Southern Bug River) is used for agricultural purposes, for the production of electricity at a hydroelectric power plant, and as a lower reservoir for a pumped storage power plant. Comparison of the main indicators of phytoplankton in the reservoirs was carried out together with its spatial distribution. It was found that the distribution of coenotic groups of plankton in the cooling reservoir corresponds to thermal conditions. In the Alexandrovskoye reservoir, separate communities of plankton are formed along its length. The description of indicator species of algae in two reservoirs is given. The important role of the catchment basin was demonstrated with statistical maps. It was shown that a significant increase in temperature in the cooling pond did not lead to the depletion of phytoplankton.

T1  - The Burden of Microplastics Pollution and Contending Policies and Regulations
AN  - 2674342235
AB  - The relationship between humans and plastics has become intricate due to their versatile nature and low production cost. Plastics generation has surpassed that of other manufactured products, which, coupled with the prevailing poor waste management systems, makes it a serious problem for the terrestrial and aquatic environments as its final destination. Their extensive presence has continued to pose a significant threat, not only to the aquatic ecosystem but also to the approximately 3 billion people relying on it for their livelihood. Even more disturbing were the recent findings of these plastics in food and drinking water and the evidence of human exposure, the long-term health effects of which are largely unknown. This ubiquitous phenomenon has over time put plastics under critical observation, leading to the development of many local and international policies, resolutions, and directives aimed at addressing and reversing the menace. This review provided the first snapshot of the global and local governance strategies currently aimed at mitigating plastic pollution, their limitations, and future directions. The findings of the review revealed several aspects of microplastics (MPs) pollution to be overlooked in policy formulation, a laxity in policy implementation, and an apparent lack of indices to ascertain the impact of the regulations. Furthermore, there is currently no regulation on MPs contamination of food and drinking water and an apparent lack of funding for research into the health effects of plastics and their alternatives. This, therefore, necessitates the need for a well-coordinated approach at international and national levels to scale up these policies in all countries and translate them from paper to measurable, holistic, and realizable actions that will address all forms of plastic pollution.

T1  - “Tracking Is Like Touching the Universe. It All Connects”: An Ethnographic Exploration of Wildlife Trackers
AN  - 2656207711
AB  - This study explored the well-being of wildlife trackers in their intrapersonal, ecological, and social identities as influenced by their wildlife-tracking practices and their connection with the wildlife-tracking community. Through an ethnographic methodology, using the methods of interview, survey, and participant observation, I delved into the culture of wildlife trackers to learn how they interact in the world and the ways that tracking and tracking culture inform their lives. The results show that tracking appears to positively inform a tracker’s personal psychological well-being using a mechanism called “inner-tracking,” which allows trackers to self-assess their roles in relationships with others and their intrapersonal relationships with their selves. Tracking appears to correlate with a positive connection to the natural world and pro-environmental behaviors. The impacts of tracking on social identity appear to be mostly positive, offering relational improvement tools; however, some participants reported negative social effects due to dissimilar interests between them and those close to them and time spent away from loved ones while tracking. It appears that the perspective gained from one’s tracking practice in nature and affiliation with the culture of the tracking community may have potential to increase the efficacy of an individual’s relationships with self, the more-than-human worlds, and other people—though the mechanism is not conclusively understood. Additionally, these relational aspects and the ways they manifest appear to be inextricably tied to and inform one another in various ways.

T1  - eDNA-based detection of the invasive crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus in streams with a LAMP assay using dependent replicates to gain higher sensitivity
AN  - 2653042614
AB  - LAMP assays are becoming increasingly popular in the field of invasive species detection but are still underused in eDNA-based monitoring. Here, we propose a LAMP assay designed to detect the North American crayfish species Pacifastacus leniusculus in water samples from streams. The presence of P. leniusculus was detected through this new LAMP assay in all but one of the nine sites sampled. No correlation was found between ddPCR absolute concentration measurements and the number of LAMP-positive technical replicates. However, we showed that using dependent technical replicates could significantly enhance the detection sensitivity of the LAMP assay. Applied to other assays, it could improve sensitivity and thus allow for a more efficient use of eDNA-based LAMP assays for invasive species detection in aquatic ecosystems.

T1  - Capturing colloidal nano- and microplastics with plant-based nanocellulose networks
AN  - 2647051815
AB  - Microplastics accumulate in various aquatic organisms causing serious health issues, and have raised concerns about human health by entering our food chain. The recovery techniques for the most challenging colloidal fraction are limited, even for analytical purposes. Here we show how a hygroscopic nanocellulose network acts as an ideal capturing material even for the tiniest nanoplastic particles. We reveal that the entrapment of particles from aqueous environment is primarily a result of the network’s hygroscopic nature - a feature which is further intensified with the high surface area of nanocellulose. We broaden the understanding of the mechanism for particle capture by investigating the influence of pH and ionic strength on the adsorption behaviour. We determine the nanoplastic binding mechanisms using surface sensitive methods, and interpret the results with the random sequential adsorption (RSA) model. These findings hold potential for the explicit quantification of the colloidal nano- and microplastics from different aqueous environments, and eventually, provide solutions to collect them directly on-site where they are produced.Nanoplastic particles in aqueous environments are challenging to quantify and characterize due to a lack of methods to capture and analyze them. Here the authors demonstrate that nanocellulose networks can be used to capture colloidal plastics and quantify them through their fluorescence and adsorption, providing kinetic information on their uptake.

T1  - Nanoparticled Titanium Dioxide to Remediate Crude Oil Exposure. An In Vivo Approach in Dicentrarchus labrax
AN  - 2642464943
AB  - The contamination of marine water bodies with petroleum hydrocarbons represents a threat to ecosystems and human health. In addition to the surface slick of crude oil, the water-soluble fraction of petroleum is responsible for the induction of severe toxic effects at different cellular and molecular levels. Some petroleum-derived hydrocarbons are classified as carcinogenic and mutagenic contaminants; therefore, the oil spill into the marine environment can have long term consequences to the biota. Therefore, new tools able to remediate crude oil water accommodation fraction pollution in marine water are highly recommended. Nanomaterials were recently proposed in environmental remediation processes. In the present in vivo study, the efficacy of pure anatase titanium nanoparticles (n-TiO2) was tested on Dicentrarchus labrax exposed to the accommodated fraction of crude oil. It was found that n-TiO2 nano-powders themselves were harmless in terms of DNA primary damage, and the capability of pure anatase n-TiO2 to lower the levels of DNA damage induced by a mixture of genotoxic pollutant was revealed. These preliminary results on a laboratory scale are the prerequisite for deepening this new technology for the abatement of the cellular effects related with oil spill pollutants released in marine environments.

T1  - Early Biological Modulations Resulting from 1-Week Venlafaxine Exposure of Marine Mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis Determined by a Metabolomic Approach
AN  - 2642434267
AB  - There is growing evidence of the presence of pharmaceuticals in natural waters and their accumulation in aquatic organisms. While their mode of action on non-target organisms is still not clearly understood, their effects warrant assessment. The present study assessed the metabolome of the Mediterranean mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) exposed to a 10 µg/L nominal concentration of the antidepressant venlafaxine (VLF) at 3 time-points (1, 3, and 7 days). Over the exposure period, we observed up- or down-modulations of 113 metabolites, belonging to several metabolisms, e.g., amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, etc.), purine and pyrimidine metabolisms (adenosine, cyclic AMP, thymidine, etc.), and several other metabolites involved in diverse functions. Serotonin showed the same time-course modulation pattern in both male and female mussels, which was consistent with its mode of action in humans, i.e., after a slight decrease on the first day of exposure, its levels increased at day 7 in exposed mussels. We found that the modulation pattern of impacted metabolites was not constant over time and it was gender-specific, as male and female mussels responded differently to VLF exposure.

T1  - The Expanding Role of DNA Barcodes: Indispensable Tools for Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation
AN  - 2642364735
AB  - DNA barcoding has transformed the fields of ecology, evolution, and conservation by providing a rapid and effective tool for species identification. The growth of DNA barcodes as a resource for biologists has followed advances in computational and sequencing technology that have enabled high-throughput barcoding applications. The global DNA barcode database is expanding to represent the diversity of species on Earth thanks to efforts by international consortia and expanding biological collections. Today, DNA barcoding is instrumental in advancing our understanding of how species evolve, how they interact, and how we can slow down their extirpation and extinction. This review focuses on current applications of DNA barcode sequences to address fundamental lines of research, as well as new and expanding applications of which DNA barcoding will play a central role.

T1  - Climate change in the Baltic Sea region: a summary
AN  - 2638869702
AB  - Based on the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports of this thematic issue in Earth System Dynamics and recent peer-reviewed literature, current knowledge of the effects of global warming on past and future changes in climate of the Baltic Sea region is summarised  and assessed. The study is an update of the Second Assessment of Climate Change (BACC II) published in 2015 and focuses on the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, ocean, sediments, and the terrestrial and marine biosphere. Based on the summaries of the recent knowledge gained in palaeo-, historical, and future regional climate research, we find that the main conclusions from earlier assessments still remain valid. However, new long-term, homogenous observational records, for example, for Scandinavian glacier inventories, sea-level-driven saltwater inflows, so-called Major Baltic Inflows, and phytoplankton species distribution, and new scenario simulations with improved models, for example, for glaciers, lake ice, and marine food web, have become available. In many cases, uncertainties can now be better estimated than before because more models were included in the ensembles, especially for the Baltic Sea. With the help of coupled models, feedbacks between several components of the Earth system have been studied, and multiple driver studies were performed, e.g. projections of the food web that include fisheries, eutrophication, and climate change. New datasets and projections have led to a revised understanding of changes in some variables such as salinity. Furthermore, it has become evident that natural variability, in particular for the ocean on multidecadal timescales, is greater than previously estimated, challenging our ability to detect observed and projected changes in climate. In this context, the first palaeoclimate simulations regionalised for the Baltic Sea region are instructive. Hence, estimated uncertainties for the projections of many variables increased. In addition to the well-known influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation, it was found that also other low-frequency modes of internal variability, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, have profound effects on the climate of the Baltic Sea region. Challenges were also identified, such as the systematic discrepancy between future cloudiness trends in global and regional models and the difficulty of confidently attributing large observed changes in marine ecosystems to climate change. Finally, we compare our results with other coastal sea assessments, such as the North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment (NOSCCA), and find that the effects of climate change on the Baltic Sea differ from those on the North Sea, since Baltic Sea oceanography and ecosystems are very different from other coastal seas such as the North Sea. While the North Sea dynamics are dominated by tides, the Baltic Sea is characterised by brackish water, a perennial vertical stratification in the southern subbasins, and a seasonal sea ice cover in the northern subbasins.

T1  - Land Use Change to Reduce Freshwater Nitrogen and Phosphorus will Be Effective Even with Projected Climate Change
AN  - 2637794939
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that projected climate change will likely enhance nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) loss from farms and farmland, with the potential to worsen freshwater eutrophication. Here, we investigate the relative importance of the climate and land use drivers of nutrient loss in nine study catchments in Europe and a neighboring country (Turkey), ranging in area from 50 to 12,000 km2. The aim was to quantify whether planned large-scale, land use change aimed at N and P loss reduction would be effective given projected climate change. To this end, catchment-scale biophysical models were applied within a common framework to quantify the integrated effects of projected changes in climate, land use (including wastewater inputs), N deposition, and water use on river and lake water quantity and quality for the mid-21st century. The proposed land use changes were derived from catchment stakeholder workshops, and the assessment quantified changes in mean annual N and P concentrations and loads. At most of the sites, the projected effects of climate change alone on nutrient concentrations and loads were small, whilst land use changes had a larger effect and were of sufficient magnitude that, overall, a move to more environmentally focused farming achieved a reduction in N and P concentrations and loads despite projected climate change. However, at Beyşehir lake in Turkey, increased temperatures and lower precipitation reduced water flows considerably, making climate change, rather than more intensive nutrient usage, the greatest threat to the freshwater ecosystem. Individual site responses did however vary and were dependent on the balance of diffuse and point source inputs. Simulated lake chlorophyll-a changes were not generally proportional to changes in nutrient loading. Further work is required to accurately simulate the flow and water quality extremes and determine how reductions in freshwater N and P translate into an aquatic ecosystem response.

T1  - Sudden Changes in Water Hardness Do Not Impact Short-Term Rainbow Trout Survival
AN  - 2632936805
AB  - Fish transferred from hard water to soft water, as can occur during the stocking of hatchery-reared fish into natural environments, experience many physiological stressors that can cause mortality. This study consisted of four trials examining the effects of direct transfer from hard (345 mg/L CaCO3) to soft water on mortality and glucose stress response of two different sizes and strains of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. The first trial subjected 90 g Shasta strain rainbow trout to a direct transfer to soft water (70 or 160 mg/L as CaCO3). The second trial used the same strain and size trout, with transfer to lower hardness values of either 0 or 35 mg/L. The third and fourth trials used 3 to 5 g Arlee strain rainbow trout. The third trial transferred the fish from 345 mg/L hardness water to water at a hardness of either 0 or 35 mg/L. The fourth trial added a secondary temperature stressor of 20 °C (versus the experimental standard of 11 °C) in combination with a hardness level of 0 mg/L. In every trial, survival was not significantly different among all treatments. Sudden and extreme changes in water hardness, even in combination with increased water temperature, did not cause trout mortality. There was also no significant difference in blood glucose over time among any of the treatments in the first three trials. In the fourth trial, glucose values did significantly vary among the treatments at 48 and 168 h after the start of the trial. However, all glucose values were relatively close to the basal level. These results indicate that changes in water hardness likely do not impact the survival of rainbow trout, negating the need for tempering or acclimation.

T1  - Towards Risk Assessments of Microplastics in Bivalve Mollusks Globally
AN  - 2632829770
AB  - The ubiquitous presence of microplastics in bivalve mollusks and related risks have raised particular concerns. In this study, the available data on the abundance and polymer type of microplastics in bivalves from twenty-two countries were extracted to comprehensively understand the risks of microplastics in bivalves. Following the data from 52 peer-reviewed papers, the abundance, chemical composition, and human exposure risks of microplastics of bivalves among countries were initially assessed. Abundance risk results indicated that bivalves from 22 countries presented a low pollution load index, showing a lower risk level (level I). The polymer risk index (H) of bivalves from Portugal (Hcountry = 1335, level IV) and India (Hcountry = 1187, level IV) were higher than the other countries due to the occurrence of hazardous microplastics, such as polyvinyl chloride. For the human exposure risks, the global mean value of microplastic exposure to humans via mollusk consumption is estimated to be 751 microplastics/capita/year, with the maximum intake by the Chinese. This study suggests that abundance risk may be a fundamental indicator for assessing the potential hazard to humans until the chemical composition risks are confirmed. This study is the first attempt to assess the potential risks of microplastics in bivalves using three evaluation models based on microplastic abundances and polymer types, which will contribute to establishing future human health risk assessment frameworks. These findings will also assist efforts in policy-making to minimize microplastic risks in seafood.

T1  - A Bayesian Approach to the Estimation of Parameters and Their Interdependencies in Environmental Modeling
AN  - 2632748474
AB  - We present a case study for Bayesian analysis and proper representation of distributions and dependence among parameters when calibrating process-oriented environmental models. A simple water quality model for the Elbe River (Germany) is referred to as an example, but the approach is applicable to a wide range of environmental models with time-series output. Model parameters are estimated by Bayesian inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. While the best-fit solution matches usual least-squares model calibration (with a penalty term for excessive parameter values), the Bayesian approach has the advantage of yielding a joint probability distribution for parameters. This posterior distribution encompasses all possible parameter combinations that produce a simulation output that fits observed data within measurement and modeling uncertainty. Bayesian inference further permits the introduction of prior knowledge, e.g., positivity of certain parameters. The estimated distribution shows to which extent model parameters are controlled by observations through the process of inference, highlighting issues that cannot be settled unless more information becomes available. An interactive interface enables tracking for how ranges of parameter values that are consistent with observations change during the process of a step-by-step assignment of fixed parameter values. Based on an initial analysis of the posterior via an undirected Gaussian graphical model, a directed Bayesian network (BN) is constructed. The BN transparently conveys information on the interdependence of parameters after calibration. Finally, a strategy to reduce the number of expensive model runs in MCMC sampling for the presented purpose is introduced based on a newly developed variant of delayed acceptance sampling with a Gaussian process surrogate and linear dimensionality reduction to support function-valued outputs.

T1  - Microplastics Occurrence in the European Common Frog (Rana temporaria) from Cottian Alps (Northwest Italy)
AN  - 2632684505
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) pollution is arousing growing attention, yet knowledge about its occurrence in amphibians is scant to date. With this study, we aimed to determine whether plastic (>5000 μm) and MPs (10–5000 μm) could be detected in adult Rana temporaria from a high-mountain ecosystem (the Cottian Alps, northwest Italy). To do this, aquatic compartments and the digestive tract of adult R. temporaria were analyzed. Water, sediment, periphyton, aquatic macroinvertebrates, and tadpoles tested negative for plastic and MPs. Microplastics were detected in all the adult frogs (n = 5); all the identified items (one per specimen) were fibers (size range: 550.91–2355.51 µm). A statistically significant positive correlation between the particle length and frog size was recorded. The predominant fiber color was blue. The chemical composition was polyamide (60%), polyethylene (20%), and polyethylene terephthalate (20%). Since both the biotic and the abiotic freshwater compartments (tadpoles included) revealed the absence of MPs, it can be assumed that adult frogs ingest MPs from the surrounding terrestrial environment.

T1  - The Role of the Ecotoxicology Applied to Seafood as a Tool for Human Health Risk Assessments Concerning Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
AN  - 2627539373
AB  - Background: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are persistent pollutants routinely detected in aquatic ecosystems. It is, therefore, necessary to assess the link between deleterious marine biota PAH effects, especially in commercialized and consumed animals, environmental health status, and potential human health risks originating from the consumption of contaminated seafood products. Thus, this review seeks to verify the relationships of ecotoxicological studies in determining effect and safety concentrations on animals routinely consumed by humans. Methods: A total of 52 published studies between 2011 and 2021, indexed in three databases, were selected following the PICO methodology, and information on test animals, evaluated PAH, and endpoints were extracted. Results: Benzo(a)pyrene and phenanthrene were the most investigated PAHs in terms of biomarkers and test organisms, and mussels were the most evaluated bioindicator species, with an emphasis on reproductive responses. Furthermore, despite the apparent correlation between environmental PAH dynamics and effects on aquatic biota and human health, few assessments have been performed in a multidisciplinary manner to evaluate these three variables together. Conclusions: The links between human and environmental sciences must be strengthened to enable complete and realistic toxicity assessments as despite the application of seafood assessments, especially to mussels, in bioassays, the connection between toxicological animal responses and risks associated with their consumption is still understudied.

T1  - RAD-tag and mitochondrial DNA sequencing reveal the genetic structure of a widespread and regionally imperiled freshwater mussel, Obovaria olivaria (Bivalvia: Unionidae)
AN  - 2623257196
AB  - Obovaria olivaria is a species of freshwater mussel native to the Mississippi River and Laurentian Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River drainages of North America. This mussel has experienced population declines across large parts of its distribution and is imperiled in many jurisdictions. Obovaria olivaria uses the similarly imperiled Acipenser fulvescens (Lake Sturgeon) as a host for its glochidia. We employed mitochondrial DNA sequencing and restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to assess patterns of genetic diversity and population structure of O. olivaria from 19 collection locations including the St. Lawrence River drainage, the Great Lakes drainage, the Upper Mississippi River drainage, the Ohioan River drainage, and the Mississippi Embayment. Heterozygosity was highest in Upper Mississippi and Great Lakes populations, followed by a reduction in diversity and relative effective population size in the St. Lawrence populations. Pairwise FST ranged from 0.00 to 0.20, and analyses of genetic structure revealed two major ancestral populations, one including all St. Lawrence River/Ottawa River sites and the other including remaining sites; however, significant admixture and isolation by river distance across the range were evident. The genetic diversity and structure of O. olivaria is consistent with the existing literature on Acipenser fulvescens and suggests that, although northern and southern O. olivaria populations are genetically distinct, genetic structure in O. olivaria is largely clinal rather than discrete across its range. Conservation and restoration efforts of O. olivaria should prioritize the maintenance and restoration of locations where O. olivaria remain, especially in northern rivers, and to ensure connectivity that will facilitate dispersal of Acipenser fulvescens and movement of encysted glochidia.

T1  - Seven Years Study of the Seasonal Dynamics of Zooplankton Communities in a Large Subtropical Floodplain Ecosystem: A Test of the PEG Model
AN  - 2621286006
AB  - Irregular hydrological events, according to a classic plankton ecology group (PEG) study, can generate major deviations from the standard PEG model. However, little is known about the function of hydrological factors in influencing the seasonal dynamics of plankton. We used multivariate and Partial Least Squares Path Modeling to analyze the seasonal variation in crustacean zooplankton and related environmental factors from winter 2009 to winter 2016 in Lake Poyang, the largest freshwater lake in China. We found a distinct seasonal pattern in zooplankton development, which deviated, in part, from the PEG model, as we found indications of (1) a weaker degree of food limitation in winter and spring, likely due to high concentrations of allochthonous sources caused by decomposition of seasonally flooded hygrophytes, also affecting sediment dynamics; (2) a peak in crustacean zooplankton biomass in summer when the water level was high (and predation was lower), and where horizontal transport of zooplankton from the littoral zone to the pelagic was possibleand (3) a higher predation pressure in autumn, likely due to a shrinking water volume that left the fish concentrated in less water. The majority of these differences can be attributed to the direct or indirect impacts of physical factor variation.

T1  - An environmental engineering approach to wastewater treatment with bivalves in the coastal zone
AN  - 2612088304
AB  - High tolerance to pollution and filtration capacity of some seston-eating bivalves and mussels of g. Mytilus first of all, principally determine mussel populations as a powerful natural biofilter. Both marine and freshwater mussels consume relatively large amounts of seston, feeding directly on the primary producers. Particles with contaminants extracted from ambient water during the filtration are accumulated in mussel pseudofaeces and faeces discharged after digestion. These specific particles of faeces and soft pseudofeaces become very suitable substrata for bacteria development with following contaminant destruction. Moreover, such biodeposits appeared to be the nutritious food for bottom detritophages, in particular of polychaetes and amphipods. Some fluid metabolites excreted by mussels, i.e. dissolved organic matter (DOM) have a pronounced biological activity to producers. In general, mussels possess high resistance to acute and chronic pollution stress, although their growth may slow down and even stops. In clean conditions food supply is the most important factor in determining activity and growth rate of mussels for northern environment. Mussel and some other aquaculture, as a relatively new application of environmental engineering is able to improve the recycling of nutrients from wastewater to bioproduction and greatly reduce the risk of environmental degradation in the coastal zone.

T1  - Review and synthesis of data on the potential environmental impact of artificial sweeteners
AN  - 2588725256
AB  - EFSA is implementing evidence-based risk assessments for the re-evaluation of certain sweeteners. The aim of this work was to ensure that, as part of the preparatory work done by EFSA to support its Panel on Food Additives and Flavourings (FAF) in reaching conclusions on the safety of permitted food additives, relevant information on the environmental risks associated with the use of the artificial sweeteners are identified. In the context of this re-evaluation process the following substances used as sweeteners were considered: acesulfame-K (E 950), salt of aspartame-acesulfame (E 962), sucralose (E 955), saccharins (E 954), thaumatin (E 957), neohesperidine DC (E 959), neotame (E 961), cyclamates (E 952) and the polyol sweeteners (sorbitols (E 420); mannitol (E 421); isomalt (E 953); maltitols (E 965); lactitol (E 966); xylitol (E 967) and erythritol (E 968)). Data was collated using a systematic review approach. Generally, the data identified was extremely limited particularly with respect to neohesperidine DC, neotame, thaumatin and the polyol sweeteners. However, there was also limited evidence to suggest their widespread occurrence in the environment. With respect to acesulfame-K, sucralose, cyclamates and saccharin multiple studies were identified that demonstrate the widespread distribution of these sweeteners in surface waters, groundwaters, coastal and marine waters. There are also studies showing their presence in drinking (tap) water supplies, rainwater and in atmospheric samples. However, these sweeteners do not appear to be highly toxic to aquatic species, at least not at environmental concentrations currently seen. The salt of aspartame-acesulfame easily dissociates into its two component sweeteners in the human body and the environment and so the review process also considered aspartame despite it not being a specific focus of the regulatory review process. Whilst there is some evidence to suggest aspartame is toxic to aquatic species it is not detected at levels of concern in the environment.

T1  - Angler and environmental influences on walleye Sander vitreus and muskellunge Esox masquinongy angler catch in Escanaba Lake, Wisconsin 2003–2015
AN  - 2578157308
AB  - Angler trip success and catch rates are dependent upon a fishes’ vulnerability to angling. Angling vulnerability can be influenced by angler-specific attributes (i.e., bait choice, lure size, use of a guide), and individual fish traits (i.e., boldness, aggression, stress responsiveness, and memory retention). The mechanisms that function in a fishes’ angling vulnerability, and contribute to catch rate, are likely correlated with environmental factors however, the influence of environmental factors on angling vulnerability are not well understood. We used the long-term (1946 –present) compulsory creel dataset from Escanaba Lake, WI, USA to test for interactions between angling vulnerability (i.e., angler trip success and catch rates) and environmental factors to better understand these dynamics in recreational fisheries. Our objective was to test for the influence of angler associated variables and environmental factors on open water angler trip success (i.e., catch ≥ one fish) and catch rate of walleye Sander vitreus and muskellunge Esox masquinongy during 2003–2015 using a hurdle model approach. Fishing trip success and catch rates for both species were most strongly influenced by angler-related variables (i.e., guide status, bait type, the proportion of the fish population previously caught). Environmental factors associated with lower light intensity (i.e., diel period, mean daily solar radiation, solar-Julian day interaction) had a positive influence on walleye vulnerability. Lower air temperatures and lunar position (moon overhead or underfoot) and phase (gibbous’ and full moon) also had a positive effect on walleye angling. Muskellunge trip success and catch rate were positively influenced by light metrics (i.e., diel period and mean daily solar radiation) and increased with air temperature. Lunar variables (position and phase), as well as wind speed and direction also influenced muskellunge angling vulnerability. A better understanding of the influence of environmental factors on angling vulnerability is an important component of fisheries management as management goals focus on balancing fish populations and creating satisfactory catch rates to enhance the angling experience. Our results suggest that angler-specific variables, light, temperature, lunar, and weather conditions influenced species-specific angling vulnerability for walleye and muskellunge.

T1  - Reproduction Under Stress: Acute Effect of Low Salinities and Heat Waves on Reproductive Cycle of Four Ecologically and Commercially Important Bivalves
AN  - 2557302275
AB  - Given the ecological and socioeconomic importance of estuaries, the impacts of climate change on their structure and functioning is a major focus of concern, even more when the affected species support important fisheries as the venerid clams Ruditapes decussatus, R. philippinarum, Venerupis corrugata, and the cockle Cerastoderma edule in Europe whose reproductive performance, in the context of climate stressors, has not yet been investigated. Thus, our objective was to experimentally evaluate the potential effect of low salinity and atmospheric heatwave stresses on their reproductive cycle. To test it, bivalves were exposed during six days to four different salinity ramps (5-20, 10-25, 15-30, 30-30) during simulated tidal cycles over three different periods of the year (autumn, winter and spring); also, in summer, they were exposed to atmospheric heatwaves at low tide (20, 27, 32, 37°C) during four consecutive days. Histological slides were analyzed to determine their gametogenetic stage and a gonadal index was calculated. Both low salinity and heatwave stresses compromised reproduction but the response was species-specific dependent and varied with the time of the year, therefore with the gametogenic cycle. In December, during sexual resting and the beginning of gametogenesis, a delay in the gametogenesis was recorded in the four species at lower salinities. In March and May, at the peak of the reproductive period, the response was different; abnormal oocytes in R. decussatus and resorption of gametes with hemocytic infiltration in R. philippinarum and V. corrugata were observed. Sediment temperatures higher than 32ºC provoked gonadal resorption and severe hemocytic invasion in V. corrugata, R. decussatus and C. edule but no effect in R. philippinarum. These responses were related to the allocation of energy from reproduction towards defense and repair mechanisms to ensure survival. Contrastingly, low salinities triggered massive spawning in C. edule that could lead to a mismatch between the presence of larvae and phytoplankton, causing potentially starvation and thus reducing recruitment success. For short-lived species as these bivalves if low salinity episodes in winter and spring are followed by a heatwave in summer, reproduction would be compromised, and the impact magnified if this situation happens during consecutive years

T1  - Handbook of Catchment Management
AN  - 2553907507
AB  - In 2010, the first edition of the 
Handbook of Catchment Management provided a benchmark on how our understanding and actions in water management within a catchment context had evolved in recent decades. Over ten years on, the catchment management concept is entering a new phase of development aligned to contemporary and future challenges. These include climate change uncertainty, further understanding in ecological functioning under change, the drive for a low-carbon, energy efficient and circular society, multiple uses of water, the emergence of new pollutants of concern, new approaches to valuation, finance and pricing mechanisms, stewardship and community engagement, the integration of water across the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the link between water, energy and food. These developments are framed within an increasingly data rich world where new analytics, sensor technology and processing power are informing increasingly real-time decision making. The challenge is also to increase cross-compliance and policy integration to meet multiple stakeholder objectives, and to link actions to achieve cost-effective outcomes. In addition, there are a number of new and exciting city, region and basin-scale real-world examples of contemporary and new catchment thinking; integrating science, technology, knowledge and governance to address multiple drivers and complex problems from across the globe. The time is now right, to capture the new challenges facing catchment management and water resources management globally. 
This revised and updated edition of the 
Handbook of Catchment Management features: 
 
Thoroughly rewritten chapters which provide an up-to-date view of catchment management issues and contexts 
New case study material highlighting multi-sectoral management in different globally significant basins and different geographical locations 
Up-to-date topics selected for their resonance not only in natural sciences and engineering, but also in other fields, such as socio-economics, law and policy  
The 
Handbook is designed for a broad audience, but will be particularly useful for advanced students, researchers, academics and water sector professionals such as planners, consultants and regulators.

T1  - Don't move a mussel? Parasite and disease risk in conservation action
AN  - 2563512194
AB  - Freshwater mussels are one of the most endangered animal groups globally, making them a high conservation priority. Conservationists increasingly employ translocation or captive breeding procedures to support ailing populations, and the ecosystem engineering capabilities of mussels are being increasingly harnessed in bioremediation projects. However, there is little consideration of the risk of pathogen transmission when moving mussels from hatcheries or wild donor populations into new habitats. This is of significant concern as recent developments suggest parasites and diseases are highly prevalent and have contributed to several mass population‐level die‐offs. Here, we explicitly highlight the risks of pathogen spread in mussel translocations, explore how these risks are mediated, and provide recommendations for both research and action to avoid the inadvertent spread of virulent pathogens when conserving vulnerable mussel populations. While targeted at freshwater conservationists, this perspective has relevance for considering translocation‐mediated disease and parasite spread in any study system.

T1  - Heavy Metal, Rare Earth Element and Pb Isotope Dynamics in Mussels During a Depuration Experiment in the Gulf of Aqaba, Northern Red Sea
AN  - 2545781221
AB  - Mussels are considered highly efficient marine biomonitors, tracing anthropogenic and natural variations in heavy metals and various organic compounds. While heavy metals depuration processes in biomonitors are of growing interest, less knowledge is available regarding their Pb isotopes and rare earth elements (REEs) accumulation-release dynamics, and their response to short-term anthropogenic and terrigenous perturbations. Here, we report the results of a relocation experiment where a group of mussels (Brachidontes pharaonis) were extracted from a contaminated lagoon in the Gulf of Aqaba, northern Red Sea, and placed in water tables that were flushed continuously with fresh, uncontaminated seawater. Pairs of mussels were removed periodically from the water table over a period of 13 weeks and trace and rare earth elements and Pb isotopic compositions were determined separately for mussel shells and soft tissue. The results display a clear decrease over time in the concentrations of various heavy metals and REEs in the soft tissue, in concert with a similar shift in the Pb isotopic compositions towards seawater values. By contrast, the elemental and isotopic composition of the shell presents little change over time. Coupling between the Pb isotopic composition of corresponding soft tissue and shell samples allows back-calculation of the timing and magnitude of abrupt contamination events and provides quantitative constraints on long and short-term contamination events. Importantly however, considering the shallow coastal environment, the results may be biased by contributions of terrigenous material. Accordingly, Al-normalized element concentrations, Pb isotopes and the Ce anomalies, enabled the identification of two distinct terrigenous end members controlling the two sites. In summary, the study demonstrates the potential of using mussels as robust biomonitors of natural and anthropogenic environmental perturbations through the combination between elemental concentrations and the isotopic composition of Pb.

T1  - Bioaccumulation, Biodistribution, Toxicology and Biomonitoring of Organofluorine Compounds in Aquatic Organisms
AN  - 2544994583
AB  - This review is a survey of recent advances in studies concerning the impact of poly- and perfluorinated organic compounds in aquatic organisms. After a brief introduction on poly- and perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) features, an overview of recent monitoring studies is reported illustrating ranges of recorded concentrations in water, sediments, and species. Besides presenting general concepts defining bioaccumulative potential and its indicators, the biodistribution of PFCs is described taking in consideration different tissues/organs of the investigated species as well as differences between studies in the wild or under controlled laboratory conditions. The potential use of species as bioindicators for biomonitoring studies are discussed and data are summarized in a table reporting the number of monitored PFCs and their total concentration as a function of investigated species. Moreover, biomolecular effects on taxonomically different species are illustrated. In the final paragraph, main findings have been summarized and possible solutions to environmental threats posed by PFCs in the aquatic environment are discussed.

T1  - Stock mapping, size structure and biological parameters of the clam Polititapes aureus in the shellfish production area of the southern Tunisian waters (Central Mediterranean)
AN  - 2811991790
AB  - The clam Polititapes aureus is one of the most abundant shellfish species in the southern Tunisian waters. Its current exploitation status and management are becoming a major concern for fishing industry in Tunisia. The significant ecological role of the species and possible future commercial benefits require a better knowledge of its stock. This research is the first attempt to investigate its current status in an area with the largest shellfish production. The obtained results showed a scattered distribution. The stock density ranged from 0 to 124 ind. m−2, and biomass values varied from 0 to 300 g m−2. This results in a remarkable biomass of 201.2 (± 64.6) t and high abundance reaching 91.3 ± 32.9 million individuals, estimated an area of 4182 ha. The species distribution was also investigated, with the size ranging from 4.9 to 35.34 mm. The overall sex ratio (F:M) was 1.26:1, which significantly deviated different from parity (1:1). The main environmental factors were identified and several abiotic parameters were found to strongly affect the spread of the clam species. The clam reproduce well and is expected to almost meet the domestic market demand through artisanal fishery.

T1  - Plastic additives: challenges in ecotox hazard assessment
AN  - 2513407373
AB  - The risk of plastic debris, and specifically micro(nano)plastic particles, to ecosystems remains to be fully characterized. One particular issue that warrants further characterization is the hazards associated with chemical additives within micro(nano)plastic as they are not chemically bound within the polymers and can be persistent and biologically active. Most plastics contain additives and are therefore potential vectors for the introduction of these chemicals into the environment as they leach from plastic, a process that can be accelerated through degradation and weathering processes. There are knowledge gaps on the ecotoxicological effects of plastic additives and how they are released from parent plastic materials as they progressively fragment from the meso to micro and nano scale. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of the ecotoxicity of plastic additives and identifies research needs to characterize the hazard they present to exposed biota. The potential ecological risk of chemical additives is of international concern so key differences in governance between the European Union and New Zealand to appropriately characterize their risk are highlighted.

T1  - Incorporation of feeding functional group information informs explanatory patterns of long-term population changes in fish assemblages
AN  - 2506680888
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate long term trends of fish taxa in southern Lake Michigan while incorporating their functional roles to improve our understanding of ecosystem level changes that have occurred in the system over time. The approach used here highlighted the ease of incorporating ecological mechanisms into population models so researchers can take full advantage of available long-term ecosystem information. Long term studies of fish assemblages can be used to inform changes in community structure resulting from perturbations to aquatic systems and understanding these changes in fish assemblages can be better contextualized by grouping species according to functional groups that are grounded in niche theory. We hypothesized that describing the biological process based on partial pooling of information across functional groups would identify shifts in fish assemblages that coincide with major changes in the ecosystem (e.g., for this study, shifts in zooplankton abundance over time). Herein, we analyzed a long-term Lake Michigan fisheries dataset using a multi-species state space modeling approach within a Bayesian framework. Our results suggested the population growth rates of planktivores and benthic invertivores have been more variable than general invertivores over time and that trends in planktivores can be partially explained by ecosystem changes in zooplankton abundance. Additional work incorporating more ecosystem parameters (e.g., primary production, etc.) should be incorporated into future iterations of this novel modeling concept.

T1  - Features of the restoration of biological communities after the technogenic transformation of the estuary area of the Pregolya River (the Baltic Sea basin)
AN  - 2511971774
AB  - The structural parameters of plankton, benthos and macrophytes after large-scale technogenic transformation of the mouth area of the river were studied. Pregolya. A decrease in the species richness and area of growth of macrophytes, a simplification of the structure of communities was noted. The renewal of plant communities in the places of their origin was recorded, primarily due to the species resistant to biogenic pollution. A decrease in the abundance of submerged species with wide leaves was revealed, which is an indicator of an increase in water turbidity. The species were found in the phyto- and zooplankton community, living in conditions of an increased content of nutrients and suspended matter. There was no significant decrease in the species diversity of summer plankton and benthos, and the quantitative indicators are comparable with the data before the work. A feature of the restoration of the zooplankton and benthic community was the appearance of brackish-water species in the river branches, which were not previously recorded there, incl. alien species of mollusks and polychaetes.

T1  - Certain detection of uncertain taxa: eDNA detection of a cryptic mountain sucker ( Pantosteus jordani ) in the Upper Missouri River, USA
AN  - 2501484636
AB  - A lineage of the Mountain Sucker species complex (Pantosteus jordani) exists as a genetically and morphologically distinct taxon restricted to the Missouri River basin. This species is thought to be declining throughout its range and is assumed to be extirpated from the southern portion of its distribution. We developed a quantitative PCR‐based environmental DNA assay for P. jordani to help define and monitor its current range. The assay is both specific to P. jordani and sensitive to low amounts of DNA, with a detection limit of 10 DNA copies per reaction. In vitro experiments involved testing DNA from twenty tissue samples, collected from the Missouri River basin in Montana and Wyoming. The assay efficiently detected DNA of all P. jordani samples and did not amplify DNA of any closely related nontarget species. Additionally, 29 environmental DNA samples were taken in 19 waterbodies within P. jordani range and its presence or absence was determined prior to sampling at six of 29 sites. All sites where P. jordani was known absent produced negative results, and all sites where it was known present were confirmed with environmental DNA detections. The new assay was able to detect P. jordani at ten sites which were not previously known to contain individuals, demonstrating that this tool has the potential to rapidly expand the current understanding of this taxon's distribution.

Torchin Roles Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review & editing Affiliation: Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Balboa, Ancon, Republic of Panama Introduction In symbiotic interactions [1], the identity of partner species can alter the costs and benefits for hosts and symbionts, leading to differences in the degree to which the interactions are beneficial, neutral, or antagonistic [2].

Symbiotic polyclads are potentially useful models for testing ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying host preference in marine symbionts, owing to their ability to utilize multiple host species and greater ease of manipulation under a laboratory setting [30, 32].

[...]we used a field experiment to assess whether flatworms variably influence the growth and survival of their preferred and less-preferred snail hosts.

T1  - The Transformations and Fate of Nanoplastics and Microplastics in Aquatic Environments
AN  - 2700375715
AB  - The risks posed by plastic debris to the environment and human health, depend on several factors, including their 1) tendency to remain colloidally stable in the aquatic environment, 2) transport potential in natural aquatic environments, including the subsurface, and 3) potential to act as vectors for other pollutants in ecosystems. An improved understanding of the key processes and factors that govern the behaviour of plastic debris under realistic environmental conditions will contribute towards providing mitigating strategies for plastic pollution as well as improved risk assessment.In the first part of this thesis, the scientific literature was critically reviewed and used to determine an estimate of plastic loads and pathways in different environmental compartments. The key factors controlling the aggregation, deposition and contaminant cotransport of microplastics in the aquatic environment were identified and critically analyzed. From the critical data synthesis, it was shown that the rubbery polymer, polyethylene, generally has a higher contaminant sorption capacity than other synthetic plastic types. Important gaps in the literature that preclude our understanding of the risks associated with nanoplastics and microplastics in the aquatic environment were identified.To address some of these knowledge gaps, the next part of this thesis investigated the role of climate and temperature cycling on nanoplastic transport. It is shown that by ignoring the effect of freeze-thaw, a key component of cold climate regions, previous conclusions on nanoplastic mobility might have been overestimated. Controlled laboratory experiments were used to show that exposure of nanoplastics to repeated freeze-thaw cycles, such as those experienced in cold climates will lead to aggregation and reduced transport in soils and subsurface environments. These experiments also provided insight into the strength of the freeze-thaw induced aggregates, showing that they are not prone to disaggregation even after applying a high shear force to disaggregate them. Although the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) significantly increases nanoplastic mobility, it was not sufficient to counter the impact of freeze-thaw.  In another study, the factors and mechanisms by which different plastic sizes interact with NOM (humic acid, fulvic acid and alginate) in simple and complex artificial and natural environmental matrices were investigated and compared. It was shown that the different organic molecules will interact with the different plastics in a size-specific manner. In the absence of NOM, the minimum CaCl2 concentration needed to destabilize the particle suspension is insensitive to plastic size. Although the presence of the polysaccharide alginate enhanced aggregation in CaCl2, it had no effect/stabilized nanoplastics in a complex ionic matrix. While there were no significant differences in the attachment efficiencies of both bare nanoplastics at the CCC (CaCl2) and in artificial seawater, the larger nanoplastics were more stable than the smaller ones in a natural seawater matrix. A critical literature review reveals that only ten percent of laboratory studies investigating the effects of microplastic pollution in ecosystems have used environmentally relevant (aged) particles. An extensive synthesis of laboratory effect studies in the context of environmentally relevant protocols for weathered microplastics, nanoplastics and leachates is presented which also provides a framework for method harmonization.Alternate abstract:Les risques que représentent les débris plastiques pour l'environnement et la santé humaine dépendent de plusieurs facteurs, dont leur tendance à rester colloïdalement stables, leur potentiel de transport et leur capacité à agir comme vecteurs d'autres polluants dans l'environnement aquatique. Une meilleure compréhension des processus et facteurs clés qui régissent le comportement des débris plastiques dans des conditions environnementales réalistes contribuera à l'élaboration de stratégies d'atténuation de la pollution plastique et à une évaluation précise des risques.  La littérature scientifique a fait l'objet d'un examen critique et a été utilisée pour déterminer les estimations des charges et des voies de pénétration des plastiques dans différents compartiments de l'environnement. Les facteurs clés contrôlant l'agrégation, le dépôt et le cotransport des contaminants des microplastiques (MPs) dans l'environnement aquatique, ainsi que les lacunes importantes dans les connaissances ont été identifiés et analysés de manière critique. La synthèse critique des données a montré que le polymère caoutchouteux, le polyéthylène, a généralement une plus grande capacité de sorption des contaminants que les autres types de plastique synthétique. La partie suivante de cette thèse a étudié le rôle du climat et des cycles de température sur le transport des nanoplastiques (NPs). Il est démontré qu'en ignorant l'effet du gel-dégel, un élément clé des régions à climat froid, les conclusions précédentes sur la mobilité des NPs pourraient avoir été surestimées. Des expériences contrôlées en laboratoire ont été utilisées pour montrer que l'exposition des NPs à des cycles répétés de gel-dégel, tels que ceux que l'on rencontre dans les climats froids, entraîne une agrégation et une réduction du transport, même en présence de matière organique naturelle dans les sols et les environnements souterrains.  Dans une autre étude, les facteurs et les mécanismes par lesquels différentes tailles de plastique interagissent avec les NOM (acide humique, acide fulvique et alginate) dans des matrices environnementales artificielles et naturelles simples et complexes ont été étudiés et comparés.  Il a été démontré que les différentes molécules organiques interagissent avec les différents plastiques d'une manière spécifique à leur taille. Les facteurs et mécanismes par lesquels différentes tailles de plastique interagissent avec la  NOM, la concentration minimale de CaCl2 nécessaire pour déstabiliser la suspension de particules est insensible à la taille du plastique. Bien que la présence de l'alginate polysaccharide ait augmenté l'agrégation dans le CaCl2, elle n'a eu aucun effet/stabilisation des NPs dans une matrice ionique complexe. Alors qu'il n'y avait pas de différences significatives dans les efficacités d'attachement des NPs nus au CCC (CaCl2) et dans l'eau de mer artificielle, les NPs plus grands étaient plus stables que les plus petits dans une matrice d'eau de mer naturelle. Une analyse critique de la littérature révèle que seulement dix pour cent des études en laboratoire portant sur les effets de la pollution MP dans les écosystèmes ont utilisé des particules pertinentes pour l'environnement (âgées). Une synthèse exhaustive des études de laboratoire sur les effets dans le contexte de protocoles pertinents sur le plan environnemental pour les MPs, les NPs et les lixiviats altérés est présentée et fournit également un cadre pour l'harmonisation des méthodes.

T1  - Water Quality and Land Use in Some Midwestern Regions Such as Madison (WI) and Terre Haute (IN) Analyzed with Multispectral/Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
AN  - 2638939009
AB  - Fertilizers play a key role in agricultural production, but they also contribute to the severity of environmental problems. When agricultural fields are adjacent to streams or lakes, the overuse of fertilizers from agricultural practices can lead to eutrophication and algal blooms (i.e., Yahara lake chain, WI). In this research, empirical regression analysis was applied using remotely-sensed (RS) data, including Landsat 5, 7, and 8, and Sentinel-2, to predict eutrophication using a time series for the Yahara lake chain from 1984–2020. Supervised image analysis was applied to hyperspectral (HS) data (i.e., AVIRIS) to map the various phytoplankton classes, which were characterized as harmful (cyanobacteria & blue-green algae) versus other harmless phytoplankton groups. Finally, the efficiency of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and RS data fusion was tested using open-source tools such as QGIS & Orfeo-toolbox to improve land use & land cover (LULC) mapping.Regression models derived from Landsat sensors (5-TM, 7-ETM, and 8-OLI) and Sentinel-2 revealed that despite many measures to mitigate the amount of nutrients added to the lakes, the levels of lake’s eutrophication in the Yahara lake chain were getting worse from 1984–2020. The atmospheric correction models, including ACOLITE and C2RCC, derived the comparable outputs of chlorophyll-a concentration from various remotely sensed data of different sensors acquired on the same days. In the 2009-2011 period, the algal bloom (mainly cyanobacteria and blue-green algae) was mainly distributed near the center of Lake Mendota, leaving the water clearer near the shoreline.

T1  - Environmentally Relevant Concentrations of Triclosan Induce Cyto-Genotoxicity and Biochemical Alterations in the Hatchlings of Labeo rohita
AN  - 2624249936
AB  - Xenobiotic Triclosan (TCS) is of great concern because of its existence in a variety of personal, household and healthcare products and continuous discharge in water worldwide. Excessive use of TCS-containing sanitizers and antiseptic products during the COVID-19 pandemic further increased its content in aquatic ecosystems. The present study deals with the cyto-genotoxic effects and biochemical alterations in the hatchlings of Labeo rohita on exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of TCS. Three-days-old hatchlings were exposed to tap water, acetone (solvent control) and 4 environmentally relevant concentrations (6.3, 12.6, 25.2 and 60 µg/L) of TCS for 14 days and kept for a recovery period of 10 days. The significant concentration-dependent decline in cell viability but increase in micronucleated cells, nucleo-cellular abnormalities (NCAs) and DNA damage parameters like tail length, tail moment, olive tail moment and percent of tail DNA after exposure persisted till the end of recovery period. Glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, uric acid and urea (except for an increase at 60 µg/L) showed significant (p ≤ 0.05) concentration-dependent decrease after 14 days of exposure. The same trend (except for triglycerides, albumin and total bilirubin) continued till 10 days post exposure. In comparison to control, transaminases (alanine and aspartate aminotransferases) increased (p ≤ 0.05) after exposure as well as the recovery period, while a decline in alkaline phosphatase after exposure was followed by a significant increase during the recovery period. The results show that the environmentally relevant concentrations of TCS cause deleterious effects on the hatchlings of L. rohita.

T1  - Gene Expression Profiles in Two Razor Clam Populations: Discerning Drivers of Population Status
AN  - 2612791174
AB  - With rapidly changing marine ecosystems, shifts in abundance and distribution are being documented for a variety of intertidal species. We examined two adjacent populations of Pacific razor clams (Siliqua patula) in lower Cook Inlet, Alaska. One population (east) supported a sport and personal use fishery, but this has been closed since 2015 due to declines in abundance, and the second population (west) continues to support commercial and sport fisheries. We used gene expression to investigate potential causes of the east side decline, comparing razor clam physiological responses between east and west Cook Inlet. The target gene profile used was developed for razor clam populations in Alaska based on physiological responses to environmental stressors. In this study, we identified no differences of gene expression between east and west populations, leading to two potential conclusions: (1) differences in factors capable of influencing physiology exist between the east and west and are sufficient to influence razor clam populations but are not detected by the genes in our panel, or (2) physiological processes do not account for the differences in abundance, and other factors such as predation or changes in habitat may be impacting the east Cook Inlet population.

T1  - Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles Are Toxic for the Freshwater Mussel Unio ravoisieri: Evidence from a Multimarker Approach
AN  - 2612753678
AB  - The current work investigated the ecotoxicological effects induced by Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs), used at three different concentrations (C1 = 10 μg·L−1, C2 = 100 μg·L−1 and C3 = 1000 μg·L−1) in a laboratory experiment, on the freshwater mussel Unio ravoisieri. Biochemical analyses of gills and digestive glands revealed a stress-related disruption of the antioxidant system. The catalase activity and the rates of malonedialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide production were significantly higher in both organs following the exposure to TiO2 NPs and was concentration-dependent. In addition, based on the observed changes in acetylcholinesterase activity, it can be concluded that the disturbance threshold for the cholinergic system was less than 1 mg·L−1 of TiO2. Overall, the results suggest that the mussel Unio ravoisieri could be used as a sentinel species in monitoring surveys assessing the environmental impact of metallic nanoparticles in freshwater systems.

T1  - Monitoring fish communities through environmental DNA metabarcoding in the fish pass system of the second largest hydropower plant in the world
AN  - 2604656456
AB  - The Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant is the second largest in the world in power generation. The artificial barrier created by its dam imposes an obstacle for fish migration. Thus, in 2002, a fish pass system, named Piracema Channel, was built to allow fish to access areas upstream of the reservoir. We tested the potential of environmental DNA metabarcoding to monitor the impact of both the dam and associated fish pass system in the Paraná River fish communities and to compare it with traditional monitoring methods. Using a fragment of the 12S gene, we characterized richness and community composition based on amplicon sequence variants, operational taxonomic units, and zero-radius OTUs. We combined GenBank and in-house data for taxonomic assignment. We found that different bioinformatics approaches showed similar results. Also, we found a decrease in fish diversity from 2019 to 2020 probably due to the recent extreme drought experienced in southeastern Brazil. The highest alpha diversity was recorded in the mouth of the fish pass system, located in a protected valley with the highest environmental heterogeneity. Despite the clear indication that the reference databases need to be continuously improved, our results demonstrate the analytical efficiency of the metabarcoding to monitor fish species.

T1  - Toxicity and Functional Tissue Responses of Two Freshwater Fish after Exposure to Polystyrene Microplastics
AN  - 2602266999
AB  - Microplastics (MPs)’ ingestion has been demonstrated in several aquatic organisms. This process may facilitate the hydrophobic waterborne pollutants or chemical additives transfer to biota. In the present study the suitability of a battery of biomarkers on oxidative stress, physiology, tissue function and metabolic profile was investigated for the early detection of adverse effects of 21-day exposure to polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs, sized 5–12 μm) in the liver and gills of zebrafish Danio rerio and perch, Perca fluviatilis, both of which are freshwater fish species. An optical volume map representation of the zebrafish gill by Raman spectroscopy depicted 5 μm diameter PS-MP dispersed in the gill tissue. Concentrations of PS-MPs close to the EC50 of each fish affected fish physiology in all tissues studied. Increased levels of biomarkers of oxidative damage in exposed fish in relation to controls were observed, as well as activation of apoptosis and autophagy processes. Malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls and DNA damage responses differed with regard to the sensitivity of each tissue of each fish. In the toxicity cascade gills seemed to be more liable to respond to PS-MPs than liver for the majority of the parameters measured. DNA damage was the most susceptible biomarker exhibiting greater response in the liver of both species. The interaction between MPs and cellular components provoked metabolic alterations in the tissues studied, affecting mainly amino acids, nitrogen and energy metabolism. Toxicity was species and tissue specific, with specific biomarkers responding differently in gills and in liver. The fish species that seemed to be more susceptible to MPs at the conditions studied, was P. fluviatilis compared to D. rerio. The current findings add to a holistic approach for the identification of small sized PS-MPs’ biological effects in fish, thus aiming to provide evidence regarding PS-MPs’ environmental impact on wild fish populations and food safety and adequacy.

T1  - Main Threats in Mediterranean Coastal Wetlands. The Ebro Delta Case
AN  - 2602099970
AB  - Coastal wetlands are dynamic ecosystems that exist at the interface between land and sea. They represent environments with a great diversity of habitats and communities, high carbon sequestration capacity and a wide range of ecosystem services. In the Mediterranean, the largest coastal wetlands are found in deltaic areas like that of the Ebro River (Spain), which has a coastline length of approximately 50 km, occupying a total area of 325 km2. The Ebro Delta is included in different national and international frameworks for environmental conservation, despite which there are several risks that threaten it. The lack of sedimentary contributions due to the regulation of the Ebro riverbed (irrigation, reservoirs, and hydroelectric power generation) has caused erosion and the retreat of certain sections of its coastline. To this situation of sediment deficit must be added the threat posed by the effects of global change, such as the rise in sea level, the increase in temperature and in the frequency and intensity of storms. This study analyses the particularities of the coastal wetland of the Ebro Delta, identifying the main threats it faces, as well as possible adaptation and mitigation strategies to these changes.

T1  - Noninvasive Genetic Assessment Is an Effective Wildlife Research Tool When Compared with Other Approaches
AN  - 2602045009
AB  - Wildlife research has been indispensable for increasing our insight into ecosystem functioning as well as for designing effective conservation measures under the currently high rates of biodiversity loss. Genetic and genomic analyses might be able to yield the same information on, e.g., population size, health, or diet composition as other wildlife research methods, and even provide additional data that would not be possible to obtain by alternative means. Moreover, if DNA is collected non-invasively, this technique has only minimal or no impact on animal welfare. Nevertheless, the implementation rate of noninvasive genetic assessment in wildlife studies has been rather low. This might be caused by the perceived inefficiency of DNA material obtained non-invasively in comparison with DNA obtained from blood or tissues, or poorer performance in comparison with other approaches used in wildlife research. Therefore, the aim of this review was to evaluate the performance of noninvasive genetic assessment in comparison with other methods across different types of wildlife studies. Through a search of three scientific databases, 113 relevant studies were identified, published between the years 1997 and 2020. Overall, most of the studies (94%) reported equivalent or superior performance of noninvasive genetic assessment when compared with either invasive genetic sampling or another research method. It might be also cheaper and more time-efficient than other techniques. In conclusion, noninvasive genetic assessment is a highly effective research approach, whose efficacy and performance are likely to improve even further in the future with the development of optimized protocols.

T1  - Connectivity dynamics in Irish mudflats between microorganisms including Vibrio spp., common cockles Cerastoderma edule, and shorebirds
AN  - 2596809204
AB  - Shellfish, including the key species the common cockle Cerastoderma edule, living and feeding in waters contaminated by infectious agents can accumulate them within their tissues. It is unknown if microbial pathogens and microparasites can subsequently be transmitted via concomitant predation to their consumers, including shorebirds. The objective of this study was to assess if pathogens associated with C. edule could be detected seasonally in the faeces of shorebirds that feed on C. edule and in the physical environment (sediment) in which C. edule reside, along the Irish and Celtic Seas. Two potentially pathogenic global groups, Vibrio and Haplosporidia, were detected in C. edule. Although Haplosporidia were not detected in the bird faeces nor in the sediment, identical strains of Vibrio splendidus were detected in C. edule and bird faecal samples at sites where the oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and other waders were observed to be feeding on cockles. Vibrio spp. prevalence was seasonal and increased in C. edule and bird faecal samples during the warmer months, possibly due to higher seawater temperatures that promote the replication of this bacteria. The sediment samples showed an overall higher prevalence of Vibrio spp. than the bird faecal and C. edule samples, and its detection remained consistently high through the sites and throughout the seasons, which further supports the role of the sediment as a Vibrio reservoir. Our findings shed light on the fact that not all pathogen groups are transmitted from prey to predator via feeding but bacteria such as V. splendidus can be. As most of the wading birds observed in this study are migratory, the results also indicate the potential for this bacterium to be dispersed over greater geographic distances, which will have consequences for areas where it may be introduced.

T1  - Searching Nanoplastics: From Sampling to Sample Processing
AN  - 2596047639
AB  - Nanoplastics (NPs) are considered emerging pollutants, namely unregulated contaminants whose toxic effect on humans and the environment has been demonstrated or suspected. They are the result of the physical fragmentation of the plastics that over time reach smaller dimensions (<100 nm). The issues related to the characterization and quantification of NPs in the environmental matrices are mainly related to the infinitepsimal size, to the fact that they are found in bulk, and to the different physico-chemical forms in which the same polymer can evolve over time by degradation. To deal with the study of a new class of pollutants it is necessary to assess the entire analytical method, carefully considering every single step (sampling, cleanup, qualitative, and quantitative analysis) starting from the validation method in the laboratory. This paper reviews the analytical method steps, focusing on the first ones, which the current literature often underestimates: laboratory tests, sampling, and sample processing; in fact, most errors and the quality of the analyses often depend on them. In addition, all newly introduced sample processing methods were examined.

T1  - Developmental Toxicity of Select Ultraviolet-Filters to Daphnia magna and Their Potential Role as Invertebrate Endocrine Disruptors
AN  - 2586445821
AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) filters are emerging contaminants of concern found ubiquitously in the aquatic environment. Many organic UV filters are endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in vertebrates. However, few studies have assessed their effects on invertebrates. Ecdysis, or the shedding of the exoskeleton, is proposed to be a target of these compounds in the largest phylum of invertebrates, Arthropoda (insects and crustaceans). Ecdysis is regulated by an arthropod specific endocrine system, the ecdysteroid pathway, and alterations of this signaling cascade by EDCs results in improper development, reduced growth, or death. These outcomes may have significant implications for organismal and population health. In this dissertation, I test the overarching hypothesis that UV filters are endocrine disruptors of the ecdysteroid pathway in Daphnia magna by evaluating their effects on molting, development, and gene expression. In Chapter 2, I show that Daphnia magna chronically exposed to OMC, BP3, and 4MBC produce offspring with developmental abnormalities. Additionally, qPCR and RNAseq data demonstrate that BP3 and 4MBC affect the transcription of ecdysteroid-regulated genes. In Chapter 3, cellular transactivation assays are used to demonstrate that only one of these compounds, OMC, causes transactivation of the EcR. However, this only occurs in the presence of the endogenous hormone, indicating that a separate mechanism besides direct EcR agonism is likely for activation. In Chapter 4, OMC toxicity is further investigated using an ecdysteroid-responsive cell line. Several potential mechanisms of toxicity for this UV filter are identified using RNAseq analysis, including a possible connection to the juvenile hormone pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that UV filters appear to be both vertebrate and invertebrate endocrine disruptors. However, the concentrations needed to elicit toxicity are well above those levels detected in the environment and therefore the risk posed to aquatic invertebrates, such as Daphnia, is likely low based on the endpoints measured.

T1  - Pharmaceutical Compounds in Aquatic Environments—Occurrence, Fate and Bioremediation Prospective
AN  - 2584485253
AB  - Various contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) have been detected in different ecosystems, posing a threat to living organisms and the environment. Pharmaceuticals are among the many CECs that enter the environment through different pathways, with wastewater treatment plants being the main input of these pollutants. Several technologies for the removal of these pollutants have been developed through the years, but there is still a lack of sustainable technologies suitable for being applied in natural environments. In this regard, solutions based on natural biological processes are attractive for the recovery of contaminated environments. Bioremediation is one of these natural-based solutions and takes advantage of the capacity of microorganisms to degrade different organic pollutants. Degradation of pollutants by native microorganisms is already known to be an important detoxification mechanism that is involved in natural attenuation processes that occur in the environment. Thus, bioremediation technologies based on the selection of natural degrading bacteria seem to be a promising clean-up technology suitable for application in natural environments. In this review, an overview of the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals is carried out, in which bioremediation tools are explored for the removal of these pollutants from impacted environments.

T1  - Designing the Next Generation of Condition Tracking and Early Warning Systems for Shellfish Aquaculture
AN  - 2584402692
AB  - Early detection of environmental disturbances affecting shellfish stock condition is highly desirable for aquaculture activities. In this article, a new biophysical model-based early warning system (EWS) is described, that assesses bivalve stock condition by diagnosing signs of persistent physiological dysfunctioning. The biophysical model represents valve gape dynamics, controlled by active contractions of the adductor muscle countering the passive action of the hinge ligament; the dynamics combine continuous convergence to a steady-state interspersed with discrete closing events. A null simulation was introduced to describe undisturbed conditions. The diagnostic compares valve gape measurements and simulations. Indicators are inferred from the model parameters, and disturbances are assessed when their estimates deviate from their null distribution. Instead of focusing only on discrete events, our EWS exploits the complete observed dynamics within successive time intervals defined by the variation scales. When applied to a valvometry data series, collected in controlled conditions from scallops (Pecten maximus), the EWS indicated that one among four individuals exhibited signs its physiological condition was degrading. This was detected neither during experiments nor during the initial data analysis, suggesting the utility of an approach that quantifies physiological mechanisms underlying functional responses. Practical implementations of biological-EWS at farming sites are then discussed.

T1  - Element Contents in Three Commercially Important Edible Mollusks Harvested off the Southwestern Coast of Crimea (Black Sea) and Assessment of Human Health Risks from Their Consumption
AN  - 2584388605
AB  - Mollusks are a prospective food for the world’s growing population, but the contents of toxic and essential trace elements in them have not been studied comprehensively. In this work, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, the contents of 72 elements in soft tissues of the edible mollusks Mytilus galloprovincialis, Rapana venosa, and Crassostrea gigas from the coastal area of the southwestern Crimea were estimated and compared with the maximum permissible levels. Element accumulation similarities were observed in the two bivalve species. Cluster analysis applied to the non-normalized contents allowed finding an optimal number of non-overlapping element clusters: 1 group of macroelements, 1–2 groups of trace elements, and 1–2 groups of ultratrace elements. As an outcome of this analysis, the element accumulation universality index was introduced, which demonstrated the accumulation universality decrease in the order: mussel > sea snail > oyster. An original approach to estimating the mollusk consumption rate was proposed to assess human health risks. Two possible consumption scenarios were identified for Crimean residents. From the expected consumption of all species in both scenarios, there are no health risks, but they are not excluded, within the 95% probability, from high consumption of mussels and sea snails in the pessimistic scenario.

T1  - A Commentary on the Use of Bivalve Mollusks in Monitoring Metal Pollution Levels
AN  - 2566033705
AB  - The objective of this commentary is to promote the use of bivalves as biomonitors, which is a part of the continual efforts of the International Mussel Watch. This commentary is an additional discussion on “Bivalve mollusks in metal pollution studies: From bioaccumulation to biomonitoring” by Zuykov et al., published in Chemosphere 93, 201–208. The present discussion can serve as a platform for further insights to provide new thoughts and novel ideas on how to make better use of bivalves in biomonitoring studies. The certainty of better and more extensive applications of mollusks in environmental monitoring in the future is almost confirmed but more studies are urgently needed. With all the reported studies using bivalves as biomonitors of heavy metal pollution, the effectiveness of using Mussel Watch is beyond any reasonable doubts. The challenge is the development of more accurate methodologies for of heavy metal data interpretation, and the precision of the biomonitoring studies using bivalves as biomonitors, whether in coastal or freshwater ecosystems. Lastly, inclusion of human health risk assessment of heavy metals in commercial bivalves would make the research papers of high public interest.

T1  - The Natterin Proteins Diversity: A Review on Phylogeny, Structure, and Immune Function
AN  - 2565711720
AB  - Since the first record of the five founder members of the group of Natterin proteins in the venom of the medically significant fish Thalassophryne nattereri, new sequences have been identified in other species. In this work, we performed a detailed screening using available genome databases across a wide range of species to identify sequence members of the Natterin group, sequence similarities, conserved domains, and evolutionary relationships. The high-throughput tools have enabled us to dramatically expand the number of members within this group of proteins, which has a remote origin (around 400 million years ago) and is spread across Eukarya organisms, even in plants and primitive Agnathans jawless fish. Overall, the survey resulted in 331 species presenting Natterin-like proteins, mainly fish, and 859 putative genes. Besides fish, the groups with more species included in our analysis were insects and birds. The number and variety of annotations increased the knowledge of the obtained sequences in detail, such as the conserved motif AGIP in the pore-forming loop involved in the transmembrane barrel insertion, allowing us to classify them as important constituents of the innate immune defense system as effector molecules activating immune cells by interacting with conserved intracellular signaling mechanisms in the hosts.

T1  - Remediating Agricultural Legacy Nutrient Loads in the Baltic Sea Region
AN  - 2562196203
AB  - The Baltic Sea is considered the marine water body most severely affected by eutrophication within Europe. Due to its limited water exchange nutrients have a particularly long residence time in the sea. While several studies have analysed the costs of reducing current nutrient emissions, the costs for remediating legacy nutrient loads of past emissions remain unknown. Although the Baltic Sea is a comparatively well-monitored region, current data and knowledge is insufficient to provide a sound quantification of legacy nutrient loads and much less their abatement costs. A first rough estimation of agricultural legacy nutrient loads yields an accumulation of 0.5–4.0 Mt N and 0.3–1.2 Mt P in the Baltic Sea and 0.4–0.5 Mt P in agricultural soils within the catchment. The costs for removing or immobilising this amount of nutrients via deep water oxygenation, mussel farming and soil gypsum amendment are in the range of few tens to over 100 billion €. These preliminary results are meant as a basis for future studies and show that while requiring serious commitment to funding and implementation, remediating agricultural legacy loads is not infeasible and may even provide economic benefits to local communities in the long run.

T1  - Coastal Remote Sensing: Merging Physical, Chemical, and Biological Data as Tailings Drift onto Buffalo Reef, Lake Superior
AN  - 2549629719
AB  - On the Keweenaw Peninsula of Lake Superior, two stamp mills (Mohawk and Wolverine) discharged 22.7 million metric tonnes (MMT) of tailings (1901–1932) into the coastal zone off the town of Gay. Migrating along the shoreline, ca. 10 MMT of the tailings dammed stream and river outlets, encroached upon wetlands, and contaminated recreational beaches. A nearly equal amount of tailings moved across bay benthic environments into critical commercial fish spawning and rearing grounds. In the middle of the bay, Buffalo Reef is important for commercial and recreational lake trout and lake whitefish production (ca. 32% of the commercial catch in Keweenaw Bay, 22% along southern Lake Superior). Aerial photographs (1938–2016) and five LiDAR and multispectral over-flights (2008–2016) emphasize: (1) the enormous amounts of tailings moving along the beach; and (2) the bathymetric complexities of an equal amount migrating underwater across the shelf. However, remote sensing studies encounter numerous specific challenges in coastal environments. Here, we utilize a combination of elevation data (LiDAR digital elevation/bathymetry models) and in situ studies to generate a series of physical, chemical, and biological geospatial maps. The maps are designed to help assess the impacts of historical mining on Buffalo Reef. Underwater, sand mixtures have complicated multispectral bottom reflectance substrate classifications. An alternative approach, in situ simple particle classification, keying off distinct sand end members: (1) allows calculation of tailings (stamp sand) percentages; (2) aids indirect and direct assays of copper concentrations; and (3) permits determinations of density effects on benthic macro-invertebrates. The geospatial mapping shows how tailings are moving onto Buffalo Reef, the copper concentrations associated with the tailings, and how both strongly influence the density of benthic communities, providing an excellent example for the International Maritime Organization on how mining may influence coastal reefs. We demonstrate that when large amounts of mine tailings are discharged into coastal environments, temporal and spatial impacts are progressive, and strongly influence resident organisms. Next steps are to utilize a combination of hi-resolution LiDAR and sonar surveys, a fish-monitoring array, and neural network analysis to characterize the geometry of cobble fields where fish are successful or unsuccessful at producing young.

T1  - Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria in Clams—A Study on Mussels in the River Rhine
AN  - 2531388530
AB  - Bacterial infections have been treated effectively by antibiotics since the discovery of penicillin in 1928. A worldwide increase in the use of antibiotics led to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains in almost all bacterial pathogens, which complicates the treatment of infectious diseases. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria play an important role in increasing the risk associated with the usage of surface waters (e.g., irrigation, recreation) and the spread of the resistance genes. Many studies show that important pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria can enter the environment by the discharge of sewage treatment plants and combined sewage overflow events. Mussels have successfully been used as bio-indicators of heavy metals, chemicals and parasites; they may also be efficient bio-indicators for viruses and bacteria. In this study an influence of the discharge of a sewage treatment plant could be shown in regard to the presence of E. coli in higher concentrations in the mussels downstream the treatment plant. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, resistant against one or two classes of antibiotics and relevance for human health could be detected in the mussels at different sampling sites of the river Rhine. No multidrug-resistant bacteria could be isolated from the mussels, although they were found in samples of the surrounding water body.

T1  - Public perceptions of Lyme disease and climate change in southern Manitoba, Canada: making a case for strategic decoupling of climate and health messages
AN  - 2514822718
AB  - Background 
Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change.
 Methods 
A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change.
 Results 
Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa.
 Conclusions 
This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences. A model showing the potential relationship between Lyme disease and climate change perceptions is proposed, and implications for engagement on climate change health impacts are discussed.

T1  - Cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea: a review of models and facts
AN  - 2511821682
AB  - The ecosystem of the Baltic Sea is endangered by eutrophication. This has triggered expensive international management efforts. Some of these efforts are impeded by natural processes such as nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria blooms that add bioavailable nitrogen to the already over-fertilized system and thereby enhance primary production, export of organic matter to depth, and associated oxygen consumption. Controls of cyanobacteria blooms are not comprehensively understood, and this adds to the uncertainty of model-based projections into the warming future of the Baltic Sea. Here we review our current understanding of cyanobacteria bloom dynamics. We summarize published field studies and laboratory experiments and dissect the basic principles ingrained in state-of-the-art coupled ocean–circulation biogeochemical models.

T1  - Distribution and Numbers of Three Globally Threatened Waterbird Species Wintering in Morocco: The Common Pochard, Marbled Teal, and White-Headed Duck
AN  - 2506095783
AB  - Morocco plays a key role in the life of many migratory birds and their survival, thanks to the diversity and richness of its ecosystems. The International Waterbird Census (IWC) has been regularly implemented in Morocco since 1983. Thanks to this program, a large database on wintering waterbirds’ populations has been collected. In this article, we summarize the wintering data of three globally threatened waterbirds: Aythya ferina, Marmaronetta angustirostris, and Oxyura leucocephala. The population of Aythya ferina, which is declining, is largely distributed in the country, in over a hundred wetlands, 26 of which verify the national importance criteria. Marmaronetta angustirostris has a stable trend over the years even though its population can know high annual fluctuations; it winters in more or less 50 wetlands, among which 18 host more than 1% of its regional population and 16 verify the criteria for national importance. On the contrary, Oxyura leucocephala, a globally endangered bird only encountered in a dozen wetlands, shows a moderate increase in its numbers; only two wetlands verify the Ramsar criterion 6, while a total of six can be considered of national importance. Furthermore, given the conservation statuses of these waterbirds and according to the Ramsar criterion 2, all their hosting sites are of international importance. The results presented in this paper are a crucial step for the adoption and implementation of adequate conservation measures for the species and their key sites. Nevertheless, comprehensive research and coordinated efforts on the factors (ecological and anthropogenic) influencing the species, at the national and international levels, are required for a better understanding of their populations’ dynamics.

T1  - High-Throughput Screening of Psychotropic Compounds: Impacts on Swimming Behaviours in Artemia franciscana
AN  - 2503376361
AB  - Animal behaviour is becoming increasingly popular as an endpoint in ecotoxicology due to its increased sensitivity and speed compared to traditional endpoints. However, the widespread use of animal behaviours in environmental risk assessment is currently hindered by a lack of optimisation and standardisation of behavioural assays for model species. In this study, assays to assess swimming speed were developed for a model crustacean species, the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana. Preliminary works were performed to determine optimal arena size for this species, and weather lux used in the experiments had an impact on the animals phototactic response. Swimming speed was significantly lower in the smallest arena, whilst no difference was observed between the two larger arenas, suggesting that the small arena was limiting swimming ability. No significant difference was observed in attraction to light between high and low light intensities. Arena size had a significant impact on phototaxis behaviours. Large arenas resulted in animals spending more time in the light side of the arena compared to medium and small, irrespective of light intensity. The swimming speed assay was then used to expose specimens to a range of psychotropic compounds with varying modes of action. Results indicate that swimming speed provides a valid measure of the impacts of behaviour modulating compounds on A. franciscana. The psychotropic compounds tested varied in their impacts on animal behaviour. Fluoxetine resulted in increased swimming speed as has been found in other crustacean species, whilst oxazepam, venlafaxine and amitriptyline had no significant impacts on the behaviours measured. The results from this study suggest a simple, fast, high throughput assay for A. franciscana and gains insight on the impacts of a range of psychotropic compounds on the swimming behaviours of a model crustacean species used in ecotoxicology studies.

T1  - Asparagopsis armata Exudate Cocktail: The Quest for the Mechanisms of Toxic Action of an Invasive Seaweed on Marine Invertebrates
AN  - 2502938499
AB  - The seaweed Asparagopsis armata exhibits a strong invasive behavior, producing halogenated compounds with effective biological effects. This study addresses the biochemical responses to sublethal concentrations of A. armata exudate on the marine snail Gibbula umbilicalis whole body and the shrimp Palaemon elegans eyes and hepatopancreas. Antioxidant defenses superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), oxidative damage endpoints lipid peroxidation (LPO) and DNA damage, the neuronal parameter acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and the fatty acid profile were evaluated. Results revealed different metabolic responses in both species. Despite previous studies indicating that the exudate affected G. umbilicalis’ survival and behavior, this does not seem to result from oxidative stress or neurotoxicity. For P. elegans, the inhibition of AChE and the decrease of antioxidant capacity is concomitant with the increase of LPO, suggesting neurotoxicity and oxidative stress as contributor mechanisms of toxicity for this species. Fatty acid profile changes were more pronounced for P. elegans with a general increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with the exudate exposure, which commonly means a defense mechanism protecting from membrane disruption. Nonetheless, the omega-3 PUFAs arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) increased in both invertebrates, indicating a common regulation mechanism of inflammation and immunity responses.

T1  - Genomics and transcriptomics of the green mussel explain the durability of its byssus
AN  - 2501654800
AB  - Mussels, which occupy important positions in marine ecosystems, attach tightly to underwater substrates using a proteinaceous holdfast known as the byssus, which is tough, durable, and resistant to enzymatic degradation. Although various byssal proteins have been identified, the mechanisms by which it achieves such durability are unknown. Here we report comprehensive identification of genes involved in byssus formation through whole-genome and foot-specific transcriptomic analyses of the green mussel, Perna viridis. Interestingly, proteins encoded by highly expressed genes include proteinase inhibitors and defense proteins, including lysozyme and lectins, in addition to structural proteins and protein modification enzymes that probably catalyze polymerization and insolubilization. This assemblage of structural and protective molecules constitutes a multi-pronged strategy to render the byssus highly resistant to environmental insults.

T1  - Effects of the Marine Biotoxins Okadaic Acid and Dinophysistoxins on Fish
AN  - 2500632359
AB  - Natural high proliferations of toxin-producing microorganisms in marine and freshwater environments result in dreadful consequences at the socioeconomically and environmental level due to water and seafood contamination. Monitoring programs and scientific evidence point to harmful algal blooms (HABs) increasing in frequency and intensity as a result of global climate alterations. Among marine toxins, the okadaic acid (OA) and the related dinophysistoxins (DTX) are the most frequently reported in EU waters, mainly in shellfish species. These toxins are responsible for human syndrome diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). Fish, like other marine species, are also exposed to HABs and their toxins. However, reduced attention has been given to exposure, accumulation, and effects on fish of DSP toxins, such as OA. The present review intends to summarize the current knowledge of the impact of DSP toxins and to identify the main issues needing further research. From data reviewed in this work, it is clear that exposure of fish to DSP toxins causes a range of negative effects, from behavioral and morphological alterations to death. However, there is still much to be investigated about the ecological and food safety risks related to contamination of fish with DSP toxins.

T1  - Multi-Biomarker Responses of Asian Clam Corbicula fluminea (Bivalvia, Corbiculidea) to Cadmium and Microplastics Pollutants
AN  - 2487097491
AB  - One of the most widespread aquatic organisms in the rivers and estuarine ecosystems, in the world, is Asian clam Corbiculafluminea. This clam, that can adapt to environmental changes, is an invasive species in several areas and it was adopted as a model for toxicity tests. This study evaluated the effects of the exposure to cadmium (Cd), to microplastics (MPs) and their mixtures on C. fluminea. The oxidative stress responses, lipid peroxidation (LPO), changes in the activity of energy-related enzymes and neurotoxicity were assessed on the gill, digestive gland and gonad. The results show that Cd, MPs and their mixtures cause oxidative stress, damage and neurotoxicity. The enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the LPO levels could be chosen as biomarkers of Cd pollution. Exposure to MPs induced an increase in reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio and increased AChE activity. The combined exposure to Cd and MPs caused a synergetic effect in gill and gonad, while an antagonism response was recorded in the digestive gland. The results provide new insights for unveiling the biologic effects of heavy metal, microplastics and their mixtures on C. fluminea. Besides, we demonstrated that the Asian clam is a good bioindicator of microplastic pollution that can occur in aquatic environments.

T1  - Automating the assessment of biofouling in images using expert agreement as a gold standard
AN  - 2485324917
AB  - Biofouling is the accumulation of organisms on surfaces immersed in water. It is of particular concern to the international shipping industry because it increases fuel costs and presents a biosecurity risk by providing a pathway for non-indigenous marine species to establish in new areas. There is growing interest within jurisdictions to strengthen biofouling risk-management regulations, but it is expensive to conduct in-water inspections and assess the collected data to determine the biofouling state of vessel hulls. Machine learning is well suited to tackle the latter challenge, and here we apply deep learning to automate the classification of images from in-water inspections to identify the presence and severity of fouling. We combined several datasets to obtain over 10,000 images collected from in-water surveys which were annotated by a group biofouling experts. We compared the annotations from three experts on a 120-sample subset of these images, and found that they showed 89% agreement (95% CI: 87–92%). Subsequent labelling of the whole dataset by one of these experts achieved similar levels of agreement with this group of experts, which we defined as performing at most 5% worse (p = 0.009–0.054). Using these expert labels, we were able to train a deep learning model that also agreed similarly with the group of experts (p = 0.001–0.014), demonstrating that automated analysis of biofouling in images is feasible and effective using this method.

AB  - Mercury bioavailability was assessed by exposing the dipteran Chironomus riparius for the whole life cycle to legacy-contaminated fluvial sediments (0.038–0.285 mg Hg kg−1 d.w.) and analyzing tissue concentrations in larvae at different exposure times (7, 11, and 16 days) and in adults. In the same experiment, diffusive gradients in thin-film passive samplers (DGTs), both piston- and probe-shaped, were co-deployed in the same sediments and retrieved at the same times as the organisms. To compare the two approaches, results showed a good agreement between accumulation kinetics of C. riparius and DGTs, both approximating an apparent steady-state. A strong correlation was found between values in tissues and in both types of DGTs (r between 0.74 and 0.99). Concentrations in mature larvae (19–140 µg kg−1 w.w.), which may represent a basal level of the aquatic food web, exceeded the European Environmental Quality Standard for biota (20 µg kg−1 w.w.), which aims at protecting the top predators from secondary poisoning. Body burdens in larvae and in adults were similar, showing negligible decontamination during metamorphosis and proving an efficient mercury transfer from sediments to terrestrial food webs.

T1  - Nutrient-imbalanced conditions shift the interplay between zooplankton and gut microbiota
AN  - 2478767768
AB  - Background 
Nutrient stoichiometry of phytoplankton frequently changes with aquatic ambient nutrient concentrations, which is mainly influenced by anthropogenic water treatment and the ecosystem dynamics. Consequently, the stoichiometry of phytoplankton can markedly alter the metabolism and growth of zooplankton. However, the effects of nutrient-imbalanced prey on the interplay between zooplankton and their gut microbiota remain unknown. Using metatranscriptome, a 16 s rRNA amplicon-based neutral community model (NCM) and experimental validation, we investigated the interactions between Daphnia magna and its gut microbiota in a nutrient-imbalanced algal diet.
 Results 
Our results showed that in nutrient-depleted water, the nutrient-enriched zooplankton gut stimulated the accumulation of microbial polyphosphate in fecal pellets under phosphorus limitation and the microbial assimilation of ammonia under nitrogen limitation. Compared with the nutrient replete group, both N and P limitation markedly promoted the gene expression of the gut microbiome for organic matter degradation but repressed that for anaerobic metabolisms. In the nutrient limited diet, the gut microbial community exhibited a higher fit to NCM (R2 = 0.624 and 0.781, for N- and P-limitation, respectively) when compared with the Control group (R2 = 0.542), suggesting increased ambient-gut exchange process favored by compensatory feeding. Further, an additional axenic grazing experiment revealed that the growth of D. magna can still benefit from gut microbiota under a nutrient-imbalanced diet.
 Conclusions 
Together, these results demonstrated that under a nutrient-imbalanced diet, the microbes not only benefit themselves by absorbing excess nutrients inside the zooplankton gut but also help zooplankton to survive during nutrient limitation.

T1  - Exposure to Artificial Light at Night and the Consequences for Flora, Fauna, and Ecosystems
AN  - 2460881494
AB  - The present review draws together wide-ranging studies performed over the last decades that catalogue the effects of artificial-light-at-night (ALAN) upon living species and their environment. We provide an overview of the tremendous variety of light-detection strategies which have evolved in living organisms - unicellular, plants and animals, covering chloroplasts (plants), and the plethora of ocular and extra-ocular organs (animals). We describe the visual pigments which permit photo-detection, paying attention to their spectral characteristics, which extend from the ultraviolet into infrared. We discuss how organisms use light information in a way crucial for their development, growth and survival: phototropism, phototaxis, photoperiodism, and synchronization of circadian clocks. These aspects are treated in depth, as their perturbation underlies much of the disruptive effects of ALAN. The review goes into detail on circadian networks in living organisms, since these fundamental features are of critical importance in regulating the interface between environment and body. Especially, hormonal synthesis and secretion are often under circadian and circannual control, hence perturbation of the clock leads to hormonal imbalance. The review addresses how the ubiquitous introduction of light-emitting diode technology may exacerbate, or in some cases reduce, the generalized ever-increasing light pollution. Numerous examples are given of how widespread exposure to ALAN is perturbing many aspects of plant and animal behaviour and survival: foraging, orientation, migration, seasonal reproduction, colonization and more. We examine the potential problems at the level of individual species and populations and extend the debate to the consequences for ecosystems. We stress, through a few examples, the synergistic harmful effects resulting from the impacts of ALAN combined with other anthropogenic pressures, which often impact the neuroendocrine loops in vertebrates. The article concludes by debating how these anthropogenic changes could be mitigated by more reasonable use of available technology – for example by restricting illumination to more essential areas and hours, directing lighting to avoid wasteful radiation and selecting spectral emissions, to reduce impact on circadian clocks. We end by discussing how society should take into account the potentially major consequences that ALAN has on the natural world and the repercussions for ongoing human health and welfare.

T1  - Eutrophication and water quality policy discourse in Lake Erie Basin
AN  - 2451134419
AB  - Watershed-based approaches to addressing water quality issues often involve a diverse set of actors working collaboratively to develop policy. Such an approach is currently underway in the Western Lake Erie Basin, where the province of Ontario and the state of Ohio have embarked on a 40% phosphorus run-off reduction target to address eutrophication problems in the lake. In this study, we adopt the concept of discourse to inform our understanding of the collaborative process undertaken to develop domestic action plans (DAPs) to guide efforts by various stakeholders. We find that in both cases there were distinct groups of actors who shared and promoted a particular narrative or storyline. These storylines provided varying accounts of the science and policy aspects of the eutrophication problem in Lake Erie, and there was variation as well in the specific actors to whom they attributed responsibility. We illustrate how the storylines shaped the nature and form of the action plans. We provide a discussion of the policy implications of unequal capacities among different actor coalitions to influence trajectories and outcomes in the context of governance for water quality. It is shown that the potential of discourse coalitions to influence policy raises important questions as to whose voice is considered legitimate enough to be included in the policy process.

T1  - The Natural History of the Edwards Plateau:&nbsp;The Texas Hill Country
AN  - 2447479695
AB  - The roughly 24 million acres that make up the Edwards Plateau, commonly known as the Texas Hill Country, are characterized by rolling highlands, picturesque river canyons, and beautiful springtime wildflowers. Located in the heart of Texas, this region is home to hundreds of natural springs, thousands of limestone caves, and the famous Devil’s Sinkhole. Encompassing grasslands, savannas, and woodlands, the Edwards Plateau is a unique and diverse ecological haven. Beginning with the stories of how biologists and naturalists have defined the ecological areas of the great state of Texas over time, The Natural History of the Edwards Plateau explores the formation of the region more than a billion years ago, its diverse ecosystems, and the conservation efforts to keep those ecosystems intact and thriving. With detailed descriptions and vivid pictures of the flora, fauna, and geologic features that make this area so unique, the authors also explore the ways in which people have interacted with the ecosystems over time, from natural spring water used by San Antonio’s Pearl Brewing Company to the use of bats for gunpowder and bombing raids. In their exploration of the natural history, veteran ecologists Brian R. Chapman and Eric G. Bolen remain especially conscious of the conservation and management issues that affect the natural resources of the Edwards Plateau region, revealing their deep connection to the state. Bolstered by a glossary, further reading suggestions, and an appendix of scientific terms, this is an educational and essential guide for all Texans and environmental enthusiasts.

T1  - Evolutionary trajectory of fish Piscine novirhabdovirus (=Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus) across its Laurentian Great Lakes history: Spatial and temporal diversification
AN  - 2446374183
AB  - Piscine novirhabdovirus = Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV) first appeared in the Laurentian Great Lakes with large outbreaks from 2005 to 2006, as a new and novel RNA rhabdovirus subgenogroup (IVb) that killed >30 fish species. Interlude periods punctuated smaller more localized outbreaks in 2007, 2010, and 2017, although some fishes tested positive in the intervals. There have not been reports of outbreaks or positives from 2018, 2019, or 2020. Here, we employ a combined population genetics and phylogenetic approach to evaluate spatial and temporal evolutionary trajectory on its G‐gene sequence variation, in comparison with whole‐genome sequences (11,083 bp) from a subset of 44 individual isolates (including 40 newly sequenced ones). Our results show that IVb (N = 184 individual fish isolates) diversified into 36 G‐gene haplotypes from 2003 to 2017, stemming from two originals (“a” and “b”). G‐gene haplotypes “a” and “b” differed by just one synonymous single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) substitution, remained the most abundant until 2011, then disappeared. Group “a” descendants (14 haplotypes) remained most prevalent in the Upper and Central Great Lakes, with eight (51%) having nonsynonymous substitutions. Group “b” descendants primarily have occurred in the Lower Great Lakes, including 22 haplotypes, of which 15 (68%) contained nonsynonymous changes. Evolutionary patterns of the whole‐genome sequences (which had 34 haplotypes among 44 isolates) appear congruent with those from the G‐gene. Virus populations significantly diverged among the Upper, Central, and Lower Great Lakes, diversifying over time. Spatial divergence was apparent in the overall patterns of nucleotide substitutions, while amino acid changes increased temporally. VHSV‐IVb thus significantly differentiated across its less than two decades in the Great Lakes, accompanied by declining outbreaks and virulence. Continuing diversification likely allowed the virus to persist at low levels in resident fish populations, and may facilitate its potential for further and future spread to new habitats and nonacclimated hosts.

T1  - The chemotactic swimming behavior of bird schistosome miracidia in the presence of compatible and incompatible snail hosts
AN  - 2424238415
AB  - No effective method has yet been developed to prevent the threat posed by the emerging disease—cercarial dermatitis (swimmer’s itch), caused by infective cercariae of bird schistosomes (Digenea: Schistosomatidae). In our previous studies, the New Zealand mud snail—Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1853; Gastropoda, Tateidae)—was used as a barrier between the miracidia of Trichobilharzia regenti and the target snails Radix balthica. Since the presence of non-indigenous snails reduced the parasite prevalence under laboratory conditions, we posed three new research questions: (1) Do bird schistosomes show totally perfect efficacy for chemotactic swimming behavior? (2) Do the larvae respond to substances emitted by incompatible snail species? (3) Do the excretory-secretory products of incompatible snail species interfere with the search for a compatible snail host? The experiments were carried out in choice-chambers for the miracidia of T. regenti and T. szidati. The arms of the chambers, depending on the variant, were filled with water conditioned by P. antipodarum, water conditioned by lymnaeid hosts, and dechlorinated tap water. Miracidia of both bird schistosome species chose more frequently the water conditioned by snails—including the water conditioned by the incompatible lymnaeid host and the alien species, P. antipodarum. However, species-specific differences were noticed in the behavior of miracidia. T. regenti remained more often inside the base arm rather than in the arm filled with water conditioned by P. antipodarum or the control arm. T. szidati, however, usually left the base arm and moved to the arm filled with water conditioned by P. antipodarum. In conclusion, the non-host snail excretory-secretory products may interfere with the snail host-finding behavior of bird schistosome miracidia and therefore they may reduce the risk of swimmer’s itch.

T1  - Urban Evolutionary Biology
AN  - 2394626254
AB  - Urban Evolutionary Biology fills an important knowledge gap on wild organismal evolution in the urban environment, whilst offering a novel exploration of the fast-growing new field of evolutionary research. The growing rate of urbanization and the maturation of urban study systems worldwide means interest in the urban environment as an agent of evolutionary change is rapidly increasing.We are presently witnessing the emergence of a new field of research in evolutionary biology. Despite its rapid global expansion, the urban environment has until now been a largely neglected study site among evolutionary biologists. With its conspicuously altered ecological dynamics, it stands in stark contrast to the natural environments traditionally used as cornerstones for evolutionary ecology research.Urbanization can offer a great range of new opportunities to test for rapid evolutionary processes as a consequence of human activity, both because of replicate contexts for hypothesis testing, but also because cities are characterized by an array of easily quantifiable environmental axes of variation and thus testable agents of selection. Thanks to a wide possible breadth of inference (in terms of taxa) that may be studied, and a great variety of analytical methods, urban evolution has thepotential to stand at a fascinating multi-disciplinary crossroad, enriching the field of evolutionary biology with emergent yet incredibly potent new research themes where the urban habitat is key.Urban Evolutionary Biology is an advanced textbook suitable for graduate level students as well as professional researchers studying the genetics, evolutionary biology, and ecology of urban environments. It is also highly relevant to urban ecologists and urban wildlife practitioners.

T1  - Potential and Feasibility of Mytilus spp. Farming Along a Salinity Gradient
AN  - 2408953925
AB  - Mussel farming, compared to marine finfish aquaculture, represents an environmentally friendly alternative for a high quality protein source and can at the same time be a measure to remove excess nutrients in eutrophic areas. As such, it is considered as a promising ‘blue growth’ potential and promoted within the European Union. To expand mussel aquaculture, new regions have to be considered because there are multiple marine usages, and spatial limitations occur in coastal areas. The brackish Baltic Sea might be considered for expansion of mussel aquaculture. This study focusses on estimated production potential, economic profitability and nutrient remediation potential of mussel farming at different salinities. Four experimental mussel farms were set up along the German Baltic coast at salinities ranging from 7 to 17 psu. Collected growth data was used to calibrate and validate a Dynamic Energy Budget model and to predict the potential mussel production at twelve sites along the German coast. The estimated production and nutrient removal was used to assess economic profitability, assuming two usages of the harvest: human consumption and mussel meal production. Measured mussel specific growth rates increased with salinity from 0.05 mm d-1 in Greifswald Bay to 0.11 mm d-1 in Kiel Fjord. Within 6 months, a one-hectare farm could produce from 1 t (Darss-Zingst-Bodden-Chain) to 51 t (Flensburg) fresh mussels and remove 1.1 to 27.7 kg P and 24.7 to 612.7 kg N, respectively. Mussel farms at sites west of Rostock at salinities >10 psu could produce 5 cm mussels within 18 months, but only farms at Flensburg, Eckernförde and Kiel Fjord became profitable at a farm size of 4 ha (160,000 m³) at current market prices of 2.2 € kg-1. Regardless of the farm size, none of the farm sites could operate profitable if fresh mussels were sold for animal feeding at sales price of 0.06 € kg-1. Yearly nutrient removal costs at a small-scale farm (1 ha) ranged between 162 € (Flensburg) and 4,018 € (Darss-Zingst-Bodden-Chain) per kg nitrogen, and 3,580 € and 88,750 € per kg phosphorus, respectively.

T1  - Dynamics of nutrient and phytoplankton in Epe Lagoon, Nigeria: possible causes and consequences of reoccurring cyanobacterial blooms
AN  - 2390451695
AB  - The impact of environmental variables and processes of nutrient enrichment on phytoplankton community at Epe lagoon was studied for 18 months (November 2012–April 2014). Two cyanobacterial bloom incidences were observed in the two dry seasons during this period. Rainfall pattern regulated nitrogen limitation which triggered cyanobacterial bloom development and influenced the bloom duration. Nutrient-laden influx from agricultural practices accounted for the increase in nitrate, phosphate and the relatively low silicate. Hypoxic conditions during the two bloom episodes reflected the vulnerability of this lagoon ecosystem. The cyanobacterial blooms were dominated by potentially toxic species; Anabaena circinalis, A. flos-aquae, A. limnetica and A. spiroides. A comparison of ambient nutrient ratios with the Redfield ratio (N/P/Si = 16:1:16) showed clear temporal variations that coincided with phytoplankton dynamics and the bloom regime. Low N/P ratios were recorded during the first 8 months, and there was a shift to higher ratios during the subsequent 8 months, followed by low N/P ratios in the last 2 months. Higher silicate values coincided with decreased cyanobacterial biomass, cyanobacteria bloom collapse and proliferation of diatoms during the first annual cycle. Cyanobacterial abundance exceeded the alert level 1 and almost reached alert level 2 which call for continuous environmental monitoring and management of coastal waters.

T1  - Moving Toward an Agenda on Ocean Health and Human Health in Europe
AN  - 2352235641
AB  - The integrated study of ocean health and human health is an emerging area of increasing global importance. Growing evidences demonstrate that the health of the ocean and the health of humans have always been and will continue to be, inextricably linked. Our actions towards the oceans will significantly influence the future of the whole planet and, in turn, our own health. The current review of these issues arose from a summer school in San Sebastian (Spain), from 5th-7th June, 2019. An interdisciplinary group of researchers discussed key risks (e.g. microbial pollution, pharmaceuticals, harmful algal blooms, plastic pollution) and benefits (e.g. bathing waters, recreation, tourism) of the seas and global ocean for humanity; and debated the future priorities and potential actions for a joint Oceans and Human Health research and governance programme in Europe. The aim of this review is to contribute to the emerging scientific agenda on ocean health and human health, as well as coordinate efforts with stakeholders, policy makers and the general public. This agenda operates within the larger context of the upcoming United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development: 2021-2030, which strives to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including healthy (human) lives and well-being (SDG3) and conserving and sustainably using the oceans (SDG14), among others. In addition to summarising some of the key risks and benefits, therefore, we describe the governance of oceans and health interactions (especially in Europe), and we finish by proposing a list of elements for potential future research priorities on oceans and human health.

T1  - Robotic environmental DNA bio-surveillance of freshwater health
AN  - 2695801001
AB  - Autonomous water sampling technologies may help to overcome the human resource challenges of monitoring biological threats to rivers over long time periods and across large geographic areas. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has pioneered a robotic Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) that overcomes some of the constraints associated with traditional sampling since it can automate water sample filtration and preservation of the captured material. The ESP was originally developed for marine environment applications. Here we evaluated whether the ESP can provide reliable, timely information on environmental (e)DNA detections of human and fish pathogens and introduced fishes at U.S. Geological Survey streamgage sites in freshwater rivers. We compared eDNA collected via ESP at high frequency (e.g., every 3 h) with manual eDNA collections collected at lower frequency (e.g., weekly). We found that water samples filtered and preserved by ESPs successfully detected the DNA of human pathogens, fish pathogens and introduced fishes. Both ESP and manually collected samples provided similar information about target DNA presence. We suggest that the greatest current benefit of the ESP is the cost savings of high frequency, bio-surveillance at remote or hard to access sites. The full potential of robotic technologies like the ESP will be realized when they can more easily execute in situ analyses of water samples and rapidly transmit results to decision-makers.

T1  - Continuity of chronic predation risk determines changes in prey physiology
AN  - 2556548996
AB  - Prey reconfigure their physiology to avoid costs of prolonged predator pressure. However, these changes might not occur under periodic predation risk, with repeating acute phases. To test the effect of predation risk continuity on changes in prey physiology, we exposed amphipods: Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus jazdzewskii to periodic and constant predation cue. After one week, we measured: cellular defence systems: total antioxidant status (TAS), heat shock proteins (Hsp70); intracellular damage marker: lipid peroxidation (TBARS); condition index: glycogen concentration. Predator presence reduced TAS level in G. jazdzewskii independent of its continuity and in D. villosus after periodic exposure. Amphipods showed downregulation of Hsp70 when exposed to periodic (D. villosus) or constant (G. jazdzewskii) predation risk. Exposure to predators reduced TBARS level in D. villosus (irrespective of the continuity) and G. jazdzewskii (periodic exposure). Glycogen concentration in both species was not affected by predator presence. Thus, the continuity of the predator cue shaped prey physiology reconfiguration, optimizing costs of physiological adjustments under challenging conditions. Nevertheless, the lack of negative consequences of the prolonged exposure to the predator cue, whether constant or periodic, shows that amphipods can thrive under chronic predation risk, which is a constant part of the wild environment.

T1  - Timescale Methods for Simplifying, Understanding and Modeling Biophysical and Water Quality Processes in Coastal Aquatic Ecosystems: A Review
AN  - 2550500479
AB  - In this article, we describe the use of diagnostic timescales as simple tools for illuminating how aquatic ecosystems work, with a focus on coastal systems such as estuaries, lagoons, tidal rivers, reefs, deltas, gulfs, and continental shelves. Intending this as a tutorial as well as a review, we discuss relevant fundamental concepts (e.g., Lagrangian and Eulerian perspectives and methods, parcels, particles, and tracers), and describe many of the most commonly used diagnostic timescales and definitions. Citing field-based, model-based, and simple algebraic methods, we describe how physical timescales (e.g., residence time, flushing time, age, transit time) and biogeochemical timescales (e.g., for growth, decay, uptake, turnover, or consumption) are estimated and implemented (sometimes together) to illuminate coupled physical-biogeochemical systems. Multiple application examples are then provided to demonstrate how timescales have proven useful in simplifying, understanding, and modeling complex coastal aquatic systems. We discuss timescales from the perspective of “holism”, the degree of process richness incorporated into them, and the value of clarity in defining timescales used and in describing how they were estimated. Our objective is to provide context, new applications and methodological ideas and, for those new to timescale methods, a starting place for implementing them in their own work.

T1  - Continuity of chronic predation risk determines changes in prey physiology
AN  - 2512157904
AB  - Prey reconfigure their physiology to avoid costs of prolonged predator pressure. However, these changes might not occur under periodic predation risk, with repeating acute phases. To test the effect of predation risk continuity on changes in prey physiology, we exposed amphipods: Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus jazdzewskii to periodic and constant predation cue. After one week, we measured: cellular defence systems: total antioxidant status (TAS), heat shock proteins (Hsp70); intracellular damage marker: lipid peroxidation (TBARS); condition index: glycogen concentration. Predator presence reduced TAS level in G. jazdzewskii independent of its continuity and in D. villosus after periodic exposure. Amphipods showed downregulation of Hsp70 when exposed to periodic (D. villosus) or constant (G. jazdzewskii) predation risk. Exposure to predators reduced TBARS level in D. villosus (irrespective of the continuity) and G. jazdzewskii (periodic exposure). Glycogen concentration in both species was not affected by predator presence. Thus, the continuity of the predator cue shaped prey physiology reconfiguration, optimizing costs of physiological adjustments under challenging conditions. Nevertheless, the lack of negative consequences of the prolonged exposure to the predator cue, whether constant or periodic, shows that amphipods can thrive under chronic predation risk, which is a constant part of the wild environment.

T1  - Microplastics Pollution as an Invisible Potential Threat to Food Safety and Security, Policy Challenges and the Way Forward
AN  - 2473439318
AB  - Technological advances, coupled with increasing demands by consumers, have led to a drastic increase in plastic production. After serving their purposes, these plastics reach our water bodies as their destination and become ingested by aquatic organisms. This ubiquitous phenomenon has exposed humans to microplastics mostly through the consumption of sea food. This has led the World Health Organization (WHO) to make an urgent call for the assessment of environmental pollution due to microplastics and its effect on human health. This review summarizes studies between 1999 and 2020 in relation to microplastics in aquatic ecosystems and human food products, their potential toxic effects as elicited in animal studies, and policies on their use and disposal. There is a paucity of information on the toxicity mechanisms of microplastics in animal studies, and despite their documented presence in food products, no policy has been in place so far, to monitor and regulates microplastics in commercial foods meant for human consumption. Although there are policies and regulations with respect to plastics, these are only in a few countries and in most instances are not fully implemented due to socioeconomic reasons, so they do not address the problem across the entire life cycle of plastics from production to disposal. More animal research to elucidate pathways and early biomarkers of microplastic toxicity that can easily be detected in humans is needed. This is to create awareness and influence policies that will address this neglected threat to food safety and security.

T1  - Protein Signatures to Trace Seafood Contamination and Processing
AN  - 2465808676
AB  - This review presents some applications of proteomics and selected spectroscopic methods to validate certain aspects of seafood traceability. After a general introduction to traceability and the initial applications of proteomics to authenticate traceability information, it addresses the application of proteomics to trace seafood exposure to some increasingly abundant emergent health hazards with the potential to indicate the geographic/environmental origin, such as microplastics, triclosan and human medicinal and recreational drugs. Thereafter, it shows the application of vibrational spectroscopy (Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Fourier-Transform Raman Spectroscopy (FT Raman)) and Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (LF-NMR) relaxometry to discriminate frozen fish from thawed fish and to estimate the time and temperature history of frozen fillets by monitoring protein modifications induced by processing and storage. The review concludes indicating near future trends in the application of these techniques to ensure seafood safety and traceability.

T1  - Impacts of UV Filters in Mytilus galloprovincialis: Preliminary Data on the Acute Effects Induced by Environmentally Relevant Concentrations
AN  - 2438170399
AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) filters are present in a broad range of personal hygiene products, which may be transported via aquatic environments and domestic wastewaters due to inefficient treating station sewage removal and direct human contact. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential effects of a UV filter, in particular benzophenone-3 (BP3) (also known as oxybenzone) on the mussel species Mytilus galloprovincialis. Mussels were exposed to this organic substance for 96 h in environmentally relevant concentrations (10, 100, and 1000 ng/L). After exposure, biomarkers related with the mussels’ metabolism and oxidative stress were evaluated. The results revealed significantly higher activity of electron transport system and energy reserves (glycogen and protein (PROT)) at the intermediate concentration of 100 ng/L, suggesting that at lower concentrations mussels’ metabolism was not activated due to low stress. Conversely, at the highest concentration (1000 ng/L), mussels were no longer able to continue to increase their metabolic activity. Higher metabolic capacity was accompanied by increased PROT content associated with increased enzyme production to activate their antioxidant system. Nevertheless, at the highest concentration, cellular damage occurred as a consequence of ineffective activation of antioxidant and biotransformation enzymes. The results of the present study address uncertainties that are fundamental to the environmental risk assessment and management of these economically important near-shore bivalves and other marine species. Although an acute exposure was performed, alterations observed indicate the negative impacts of BP3 towards marine bivalves, which could be enhanced after longer exposure periods or if mussels are simultaneously exposed to other stressors (e.g., other pollutants or climate change related factors). The present study may thus contribute to the definition of fundamental knowledge for the establishment of appropriate regulatory guidelines and practices that ensure the preservation and sustainability of biological resources, allowing for prediction and mitigation of the impacts from these compounds.

T1  - Drivers of the spatial phytoplankton gradient in estuarine–coastal systems: generic implications of a case study in a Dutch tidal bay
AN  - 2434373240
AB  - As the primary energy and carbon source in aquatic food webs, phytoplankton generally display spatial heterogeneity due to complicated biotic and abiotic controls; however our understanding of the causes of this spatial heterogeneity is challenging, as it involves multiple regulatory mechanisms. We applied a combination of field observation, numerical modeling, and remote sensing to display and interpret the spatial gradient of phytoplankton biomass in a Dutch tidal bay (the Eastern Scheldt) on the east coast of the North Sea. The 19 years (1995–2013) of monitoring data reveal a seaward increasing trend in chlorophyll-a (chl a) concentrations during the spring bloom. Using a calibrated and validated three-dimensional hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model, two idealized model scenarios were run: switching off the suspension feeders and halving the open-boundary nutrient and phytoplankton loading. Results reveal that bivalve grazing exerts a dominant control on phytoplankton in the bay and that the tidal import mainly influences algal biomass near the mouth. Satellite data captured a post-bloom snapshot that indicated the temporally variable phytoplankton distribution. Based on a literature review, we found five common spatial phytoplankton patterns in global estuarine–coastal ecosystems for comparison with the Eastern Scheldt case: seaward increasing, seaward decreasing, concave with a chlorophyll maximum, weak spatial gradients, and irregular patterns. We highlight the temporal variability of these spatial patterns and the importance of anthropogenic and environmental influences.

T1  - Microplastics in Freshwater: What Is the News from the World?
AN  - 2423630726
AB  - Plastic has become a “hot topic” for aquatic ecosystems’ conservation together with other issues such as climate change and biodiversity loss. Indeed, plastics may detrimentally affect habitats and biota. Small plastics, called microplastics, are more easily taken up by freshwater organisms, causing negative effects on growth, reproduction, predatory performance, etc. Since available information on microplastics in freshwater are fragmentary, the aim of this review is twofold: (i) to show, analyse, and discuss data on the microplastics concentration in freshwater and (ii) to provide the main polymers contaminating freshwater for management planning. A bibliographic search collected 158 studies since 2012, providing the scientific community with one of the largest data sets on microplastics in freshwater. Contamination is reported in all continents except Antarctica, but a lack of information is still present. Lentic waters are generally more contaminated than lotic waters, and waters are less contaminated than sediments, suggested to be sinks. The main contaminating polymers are polypropylene and polyethylene for sediment and water, while polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate are mainly found in biota. Future research is encouraged (1) to achieve a standardised protocol for monitoring, (2) to identify sources and transport routes (including primary or secondary origin), and (3) to investigate trophic transfer, especially from benthic invertebrates.

T1  - Organochlorines Accumulation in Caged Mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis—Possible Influence of Biological Parameters
AN  - 2409764462
AB  - The accumulation of organochlorines (OCs) in mussel tissue depends on the physiological and biochemical status of the organism and its interaction with the environment. Mytilus galloprovincialis, 2- and 1-year-old mussels, sampled from Mali Ston Bay, a reference area, and transplanted to Kaštela Bay in cages, were used for the assessment of OC levels and influence of biological parameters on accumulation. Results of bimonthly exposures during one year highlighted that OC accumulation decreases with increasing mussel age. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and p,p′-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (p,p′-DDTs) increased, while organochlorine pesticide (OCP; i.e., HCB, lindane, heptachlor, and aldrin) variations were very low. Statistical analysis generally did not confirm the significant effect of lipid content on the accumulation of OCs in mussel tissue. OC levels in mussels were below the maximum permitted levels for human consumption (European Commission).

T1  - From Laboratory Tests to the Ecoremedial System: The Importance of Microorganisms in the Recovery of PPCPs-Disturbed Ecosystems
AN  - 2404466197
AB  - The presence of a wide variety of emerging pollutants in natural water resources is an important global water quality challenge. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are known as emerging contaminants, widely used by modern society. This objective ensures availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, according to the 2030 Agenda. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) do not always mitigate the presence of these emerging contaminants in effluents discharged into the environment, although the removal efficiency of WWTP varies based on the techniques used. This main subject is framed within a broader environmental paradigm, such as the transition to a circular economy. The research and innovation within the WWTP will play a key role in improving the water resource management and its surrounding industrial and natural ecosystems. Even though bioremediation is a green technology, its integration into the bio-economy strategy, which improves the quality of the environment, is surprisingly rare if we compare to other corrective techniques (physical and chemical). This work carries out a bibliographic review, since the beginning of the 21st century, on the biological remediation of some PPCPs, focusing on organisms (or their by-products) used at the scale of laboratory or scale-up. PPCPs have been selected on the basics of their occurrence in water resources. The data reveal that, despite the advantages that are associated with bioremediation, it is not the first option in the case of the recovery of systems contaminated with PPCPs. The results also show that fungi and bacteria are the most frequently studied microorganisms, with the latter being more easily implanted in complex biotechnological systems (78% of bacterial manuscripts vs. 40% fungi). A total of 52 works has been published while using microalgae and only in 7% of them, these organisms were used on a large scale. Special emphasis is made on the advantages that are provided by biotechnological systems in series, as well as on the need for eco-toxicological control that is associated with any process of recovery of contaminated systems.

T1  - Assessing Impacts of Metallic Contamination along the Tidal Gradient of a Riverine Mangrove: Multi-metal Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification of Filter-Feeding Bivalves
AN  - 2398406116
AB  - Most riverine mangroves (characterized by salinity fluctuations and tidal inundations), are seriously threatened by metallic pollution. Whether differences in salinity and tidal effects along the river continuum can affect metallic bioaccumulation and the biomagnification of species is still unknown. Bivalves are representative sessile inhabitants in mangrove ecosystems, with a high capacity to bioaccumulate metallic contaminants. The present study used two bivalves, Meretrix lusoria and Mytilopsis sallei, to monitor inter-site changes in metallic contamination and assess the associated ecological impacts along the tidal gradients of riverine mangroves. The concentrations of a total of six metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) in M. lusoria and M. sallei, collected at three different sites along Danshuei Riverine Mangrove, were investigated. The metallic concentrations of the whole soft body of the studied bivalves, and the associated surface sediment from each site, were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine the inter-site effects on the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of metallic contaminants in bivalves. There are increasing concentrations of four metallic contaminants, Zn, Cr, Cd and Cu, in the seaward direction of the bivalves. The increasing mean metallic concentrations along the seaward direction may be the effect of salinity, further decreasing the rate of the elimination of these metals, thus resulting in a net increase in metallic contaminants. Our results clearly show prominent inter-site changes in the metallic burdens of bivalves in our study on riverine mangrove ecosystems associated with different levels of bioaccumulation and biomagnification of metallic contaminants. Thus, it is important to monitor multiple sites along the dynamic environment of riverine mangroves in order to gain a good understanding of the ecological impact of metallic pollution risks. The present findings provide important evidence of the use of simple indices to assess the ecological impacts of metallic pollution in riverine mangroves.

T1  - Continuity of chronic predation risk determines changes in prey physiology
AN  - 2394526844
AB  - Prey reconfigure their physiology to avoid costs of prolonged predator pressure. However, these changes might not occur under periodic predation risk, with repeating acute phases. To test the effect of predation risk continuity on changes in prey physiology, we exposed amphipods: Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus jazdzewskii to periodic and constant predation cue. After one week, we measured: cellular defence systems: total antioxidant status (TAS), heat shock proteins (Hsp70); intracellular damage marker: lipid peroxidation (TBARS); condition index: glycogen concentration. Predator presence reduced TAS level in G. jazdzewskii independent of its continuity and in D. villosus after periodic exposure. Amphipods showed downregulation of Hsp70 when exposed to periodic (D. villosus) or constant (G. jazdzewskii) predation risk. Exposure to predators reduced TBARS level in D. villosus (irrespective of the continuity) and G. jazdzewskii (periodic exposure). Glycogen concentration in both species was not affected by predator presence. Thus, the continuity of the predator cue shaped prey physiology reconfiguration, optimizing costs of physiological adjustments under challenging conditions. Nevertheless, the lack of negative consequences of the prolonged exposure to the predator cue, whether constant or periodic, shows that amphipods can thrive under chronic predation risk, which is a constant part of the wild environment.

T1  - Effects of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate on Transcriptional Expression of Cellular Protection-Related HSP60 and HSP67B2 Genes in the Mud Crab Macrophthalmus japonicus
AN  - 2392765298
AB  - Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) has attracted attention as an emerging dominant phthalate contaminant in marine sediments. Macrophthalmus japonicus, an intertidal mud crab, is capable of tolerating variations in water temperature and sudden exposure to toxic substances. To evaluate the potential effects of DEHP toxicity on cellular protection, we characterized the partial open reading frames of the stress-related heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and small heat shock protein 67B2 (HSP67B2) genes of M. japonicus and further investigated the molecular effects on their expression levels after exposure to DEHP. Putative HSP60 and small HSP67B2 proteins had conserved HSP-family protein sequences with different C-terminus motifs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that M. japonicus HSP60 (Mj-HSP60) and M. Japonicus HSP67B2 (Mj-HSP67B2) clustered closely with Eriocheir sinensis HSP60 and Penaeus vannamei HSP67B2, respectively. The tissue distribution of Heat shock proteins (HSPs) was the highest in the gonad for Mj-HSP60 and in the hepatopancreas for Mj-HSP67B2. The expression of Mj-HSP60 Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) increased significantly at day 1 after exposure to all doses of DEHP, and then decreased in a dose-dependent and exposure time-dependent manner in the gills and hepatopancreas. Mj-HSP67B2 transcripts were significantly upregulated in both tissues at all doses of DEHP and at all exposure times. These results suggest that cellular immune protection could be disrupted by DEHP toxicity through transcriptional changes to HSPs in crustaceans. Small and large HSPs might be differentially involved in responses against environmental stressors and in detoxification in M. japonicus crabs.

T1  - Cardiac and Locomotor Responses to Acute Stress in Signal Crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus Exposed to Methamphetamine at an Environmentally Relevant Concentration
AN  - 2383108782
AB  - Methamphetamine (METH), a central nervous system stimulant used as a recreational drug, is frequently found in surface waters at potentially harmful concentrations. To determine effects of long-term exposure to environmentally relevant levels on nontarget organisms, we analysed cardiac and locomotor responses of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus to acute stress during a 21-day exposure to METH at 1 μg L−1 followed by 14 days depuration. Heart rate and locomotion were recorded over a period of 30 min before and 30 min after exposure to haemolymph of an injured conspecific four times during METH exposure and four times during the depuration phase. Methamphetamine-exposed crayfish showed a weaker cardiac response to stress than was observed in controls during both exposure and depuration phases. Similarly, methamphetamine-exposed crayfish, during METH exposure, showed lower locomotor reaction poststressor application in contrast to controls. Results indicate biological alterations in crayfish exposed to METH at low concentration level, potentially resulting in a shift in interactions among organisms in natural environment.

T1  - Mercury in Juvenile Solea senegalensis: Linking Bioaccumulation, Seafood Safety, and Neuro-Oxidative Responses under Climate Change-Related Stressors
AN  - 2379220857
AB  - Mercury (Hg) is globally recognized as a persistent chemical contaminant that accumulates in marine biota, thus constituting an ecological hazard, as well as a health risk to seafood consumers. Climate change-related stressors may influence the bioaccumulation, detoxification, and toxicity of chemical contaminants, such as Hg. Yet, the potential interactions between environmental stressors and contaminants, as well as their impacts on marine organisms and seafood safety, are still unclear. Hence, the aim of this work was to assess the bioaccumulation of Hg and neuro-oxidative responses on the commercial flat fish species Solea senegalensis (muscle, liver, and brain) co-exposed to dietary Hg in its most toxic form (i.e., MeHg), seawater warming (ΔT°C = +4 °C), and acidification (pCO2 = +1000 µatm, equivalent to ΔpH = −0.4 units). In general, fish liver exhibited the highest Hg concentration, followed by brain and muscle. Warming enhanced Hg bioaccumulation, whereas acidification decreased this element’s levels. Neuro-oxidative responses to stressors were affected by both climate change-related stressors and Hg dietary exposure. Hazard quotient (HQ) estimations evidenced that human exposure to Hg through the consumption of fish species may be aggravated in tomorrow’s ocean, thus raising concerns from the seafood safety perspective.

T1  - Toxicities of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons for Aquatic Animals
AN  - 2363209823
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic compounds that are widely distributed in the air, water, and soil. Recently, the amount of PAHs derived from fuels and from incomplete combustion processes is increasing. In the aquatic environment, oil spills directly cause PAH pollution and affect marine organisms. Oil spills correlate very well with the major shipping routes. Furthermore, accidental oil spills can seriously impact the marine environment toxicologically. Here, we describe PAH toxicities and related bioaccumulation properties in aquatic animals, including invertebrates. Recent studies have revealed the toxicity of PAHs, including endocrine disruption and tissue-specific toxicity, although researchers have mainly focused on the carcinogenic toxicity of PAHs. We summarize the toxicity of PAHs regarding these aspects. Additionally, the bioaccumulation properties of PAHs for organisms, including invertebrates, are important factors when considering PAH toxicity. In this review, we describe the bioaccumulation properties of PAHs in aquatic animals. Recently, microplastics have been the most concerning environmental problem in the aquatic ecosystem, and the vector effect of microplastics for lipophilic compounds is an emerging environmental issue. Here, we describe the correlation between PAHs and microplastics. Thus, we concluded that PAHs have a toxicity for aquatic animals, indicating that we should emphasize the prevention of aquatic PAH pollution.

T1  - Robotic environmental DNA bio-surveillance of freshwater health
AN  - 1888768134
AB  - Autonomous water sampling technologies may help to overcome the human resource challenges of monitoring biological threats to rivers over long time periods and across large geographic areas. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has pioneered a robotic Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) that overcomes some of the constraints associated with traditional sampling since it can automate water sample filtration and preservation of the captured material. The ESP was originally developed for marine environment applications. Here we evaluated whether the ESP can provide reliable, timely information on environmental (e)DNA detections of human and fish pathogens and introduced fishes at U.S. Geological Survey streamgage sites in freshwater rivers. We compared eDNA collected via ESP at high frequency (e.g., every 3 h) with manual eDNA collections collected at lower frequency (e.g., weekly). We found that water samples filtered and preserved by ESPs successfully detected the DNA of human pathogens, fish pathogens and introduced fishes. Both ESP and manually collected samples provided similar information about target DNA presence. We suggest that the greatest current benefit of the ESP is the cost savings of high frequency, bio-surveillance at remote or hard to access sites. The full potential of robotic technologies like the ESP will be realized when they can more easily execute in situ analyses of water samples and rapidly transmit results to decision-makers.

T1  - Climate projection of Lake Superior under a future warming scenario
AN  - 2408290096
AB  - In a future warming world, a fully dynamical model of Lake Superior projects that the lake will undergo significant physical and biological changes by the middle of the 21st century with important implications for the surrounding region. Projections for the winter include drastically reduced ice and very weak water column stratification. In contrast, the summertime surface warming is projected to begin earlier, last longer, and be more enhanced. In concert, summertime biological production is projected to shift earlier and become larger. These changes have potentially important consequences for stakeholders with interests in shipping, coastal habitability, fishing, water quality, and recreation. Perhaps more fundamentally, the projected changes imply that Lake Superior may change into a different kind of lake with a dramatically weakened dimictic behavior.

T1  - Consequences of the marine climate and ecosystem shift of the 1980-90s on the Ligurian Sea biodiversity (NW Mediterranean)
AN  - 2353565961
AB  - A rapid temperature increase in the 1980-90s has been accompanied by dramatic and unprecedented changes in the biota and communities of the Ligurian Sea. This review uses existing historical series (a few of which have been purposely updated) to assess extent and consequences of such changes. A number of warm-water species, previously absent or occasional in the comparatively cold Ligurian Sea, has recently established thanks to warmer winters. Occurrence among them of invasive alien species is causing concern because of their capacity of outcompeting autochthonous species. Summer heatwaves, on the other hand, caused mass mortalities in marine organisms, some of which found refuge at depth. New marine diseases appeared, as well as other dysfunctions such as the formation of mucilage aggregates that suffocated and entangled benthic organisms. Human pressures have combined with climate change to cause phase shifts (i.e., abrupt variations in species composition and community structure) in different habitats, such as the pelagic environment, seagrass meadows, rocky reefs, and marine caves. These phase shifts implied biotic homogenization, reduction of diversity, and dominance by invasive aliens, and may be detrimental to the resilience of Ligurian Sea ecosystems. Another phase of rapid warming has possibly started in the 2010s and there are clues pointing to a further series of biological changes, but data are too scarce to date for proper assessment. Only well addressed long-term studies will help understanding the future dynamics of Ligurian Sea ecosystems and their possibilities of recovery.

T1  - Mussel Caging and the Weight of Evidence Approach in the Assessment of Chemical Contamination in Coastal Waters of Finland (Baltic Sea)
AN  - 2314652467
AB  - Contamination status of coastal areas of Finland (northern Baltic Sea) markedly affected by anthropogenic activities (harbours, shipyards and maritime activity, industry, municipal and agricultural inputs, legacy contamination) was assessed for the first time using the weight of evidence (WOE) approach. The key element of the study was the caging (transplantation) of Baltic mussels (Mytilus trossulus) for the measurement of tissue accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and applying a suite of biomarkers of biological effects of contaminants. Additional variables included in the assessment were trace metals in seawater, macrozoobenthos, near-bottom oxygen levels and eutrophication indicators. The chemical parameters were supported by passive sampling of PAHs and organotins at the study sites. The integrated approach combining all the line of evidence (LOE) variables into the WOE showed separation of some sites as more affected by hazardous substances than others, with the most contaminated areas found around harbour and ship yard areas. The contaminant levels measured in the different matrices were not alarmingly high at none of the areas compared to many other areas within or outside the Baltic Sea under more heavy anthropogenic impact, rarely exceeding any given threshold values for Good Environmental Status of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. However, significant biological effects were recorded in mussels in the most contaminated sites, signifying that the combined effects caused by the contaminants and other environmental factors are disturbing the health of marine organisms in the area. The results of this successful combined application based on the mussel transplantation method and the WOE approach are highly encouraging for further trials in developing the monitoring of chemical contamination in the Baltic Sea.

T1  - Production Characteristics and Optimization of Mitigation Mussel Culture
AN  - 2313801024
AB  - Bivalve environmental services have become a focal point for their inherent role in the management of eutrophication, while active cultivation has become increasingly acknowledged as a mechanism for integrated nutrient reduction. In recent years, cultivation practices designed specifically for nutrient extraction have emerged; ‘mitigation culture’. While modeling efforts have been able to describe expanded potential of these services, only a single commercial pilot scale, real-world demonstration, has been documented. Over two production seasons (2017-2018), the optimization of nutrient extractive potential of mussels (Mytilus edulis) at full commercial-scale was evaluated by first testing multiple density configurations of conventional longline-spat collector setups and potential harvest times, then by comparing different cultivation technologies at three farms. Potential biomass volumes of 770-1700 t with longlines and 2100-2600 t on nets was demonstrated in full-scale production (18.8 ha), yielding 0.6-1.27 t N ha-1 and 0.04-0.1 t P ha-1, and 1.63-2.0 t N ha-1 and 0.1-0.12 t P ha-1 respectively. In general, 1 t of harvested mitigation mussels will yield 13.7 kg N and 0.9 kg P. Winter harvests exhibited higher yields (103-124%) than early spring harvests on optimized configurations, favoring an abbreviated production season. Production potential was similar between sites, despite differing environmental conditions, indicating eutrophic waters are suitable for expanded mitigation production. This study presents for the first-time production data of mitigation mussels utilizing different configurations and technologies to maximize yield and nutrient extraction potential.

T1  - Freshwater mussels house a diverse mussel-associated leech assemblage
AN  - 2313769097
AB  - Freshwater mussels (Unionida) are one of the most imperiled animal groups worldwide, revealing the fastest rates of extinction. Habitat degradation, river pollution and climate change are the primary causes of global decline. However, biological threats for freshwater mussels are still poorly known. Here, we describe a diverse ecological group of leeches (Hirudinea: Glossiphoniidae) inhabiting the mantle cavity of freshwater mussels. So far, examples of mussel-associated leech species are recorded from East Asia, Southeast Asia, India and Nepal, Africa, and North America. This group comprises a dozen glossiphoniid species with a hidden life style inside the mantle cavity of their hosts largely overlooked by researchers. We show that the association with freshwater mussels evolved independently in three leech clades, i.e. Batracobdelloides, Hemiclepsis, and Placobdella, at least since the Miocene. Seven mussel-associated leech species and two additional free-living taxa are described here as new to science.

T1  - Gonadal Histopathological Disorders in Mytilus galloprovincialis Male Exposed to Tars Used in Mussel Farms
AN  - 2289718633
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and trace metals are pollutants widely distributed in the marine environment with toxic effects on live organisms, but few laboratory studies have proved their causal relationship with histopathologic alterations from invertebrates. We analyse the histopathologic effects of a tar mixture used in mussel farms on the gonad of male mussels. Mussels were exposed to water-accommodated fractions from different sub-lethal concentrations of that tar mixture during different times. The accumulation of PAHs and metals in mussels was quantified in each one tar exposure condition, and a comparative histological and morphometric analysis of the male gonad was performed, as well as of the gametogenic disorders and the cellular pathologies induced. Spermatogenesis disruption and alterations of somatic and germinal cells were observed as a direct effect of treatment. The pathologies observed followed an increasing malignity sequence depending on dose and exposure time: spawning induction; arrest of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis; suppression of immune response; dysplasia of Sertoli and connective cells and finally, severe disorders of germinal cells. We demonstrate for the first time that tar used in waterproofing of floating rafts from the mussel farms causes severe effects on male mussel gonad, constituting a direct risk to the health of these organisms, affecting gametogenesis, quality of gametes and, ultimately, the sustainability of this resource and their quality for human consumption. Moreover, we propose the pathologies described in mussel as biomarkers of marine pollution and the mussel gonad as study model of testicular toxicity mechanisms in male reproduction.

T1  - Transcriptomic Analysis of the Onchidium reevesii Central Nervous System in Response to Cadmium
AN  - 2284656301
AB  - Shellfish are widely used in coastal environments for biomonitoring of heavy metal pollution. Research on the sea slug Onchidium reevesii, an economically important benthic gastropod, is limited due to a lack of genomic resources. This study, based on Illumina sequencing, compared the transcriptomes of O. reevesii before and after cadmium exposure, and used time-series expression analysis. The molecular level stress response mechanism operating in this organism in environmental stress conditions was investigated. De novo assembly of the O. reevesii transcriptome yielded 51,007 unigenes, of which 14,774 were annotated. Time-series expression analyses resulted in clustering of most responsive transcripts into 16 statistically significant expression profiles. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis based on time-series expression identified metal ion binding, synaptic transmission, and oxidative stress as important biological processes, and expression analysis identified genes related to invertebrate responses to environmental stress. Furthermore, we have generated the first transcriptome of O. reevesii, and the extensive sequence data produced will provide valuable molecular resources for study of the response of O. reevesii to cadmium exposure.

T1  - The lampenflora in show caves and its treatment: an emerging ecological problem
AN  - 2412999882
AB  - The artificial lighting of caves adapted for touristic visits, leads to the appearance and propagation of a complex community of phototrophic organisms known as "lampenflora". Formed mainly by algae and cyanobacteria, they produce the degradation of the colonized substrates and decrease the show value of the caves. This phenomenon became famous worldwide in the 1960s due to the damage caused to the paintings in the Lascaux Cave (France). Since then it has become an issue of serious concern to both managers of show caves and to the international scientific community. Over time, the problem has been approached following two complementary strategies: preventing colonization by the invading organisms or eliminating them once they have become established through the use of chemical products, mainly biocides and strong oxidants. This kind of treatment generates pollutant effluents that can move the problem from the walls of the caves to the groundwater. This paper presents a critical literature review of the problem and the proposed solutions, and emphasizes the need for further study of the optimal doses of treatment chemicals and to develop quantitative methods to determine their effectiveness.

T1  - Chronic radiation exposure at Chernobyl shows no effect on genetic diversity in the freshwater crustacean, Asellus aquaticus thirty years on
AN  - 2312223287
AB  - Analysis of genetic diversity represents a fundamental component of ecological risk assessments in contaminated environments. Many studies have assessed the genetic implications of chronic radiation exposure at Chernobyl, generally recording an elevated genetic diversity and mutation rate in rodents, plants, and birds inhabiting contaminated areas. Only limited studies have considered genetic diversity in aquatic biota at Chernobyl, despite the large number of freshwater systems where elevated dose rates will persist for many years. Consequently, the present study aimed to assess the effects of chronic radiation exposure on genetic diversity in the freshwater crustacean, Asellus aquaticus, using a genome‐wide SNP approach (Genotyping‐by‐sequencing). It was hypothesized that genetic diversity in A. aquaticus would be positively correlated with dose rate. A. aquaticus was collected from six lakes in Belarus and the Ukraine ranging in dose rate from 0.064 to 27.1 µGy/hr. Genotyping‐by‐sequencing analysis was performed on 74 individuals. A significant relationship between geographical distance and genetic differentiation confirmed the Isolation‐by‐Distance model. Conversely, no significant relationship between dose rate and genetic differentiation suggested no effect of the contamination gradient on genetic differentiation between populations. No significant relationship between five measures of genetic diversity and dose rate was recorded, suggesting that radiation exposure has not significantly influenced genetic diversity in A. aquaticus at Chernobyl. This is the first study to adopt a genome‐wide SNP approach to assess the impacts of environmental radiation exposure on biota. These findings are fundamental to understanding the long‐term success of aquatic populations in contaminated environments at Chernobyl and Fukushima.

T1  - Inbreeding does not alter the response to an experimental heat wave in a freshwater snail
AN  - 2270188493
AB  - Global climate change affects natural populations of many species by increasing the average temperature and the frequency of extreme weather events (e.g. summer heat waves). The ability of organisms to cope with these environmental changes can, however, depend on their genetic properties. For instance, genetic load owing to inbreeding could alter organisms’ responses to climate change-mediated environmental changes but such effects are often overlooked. We investigated the effects of an experimental heat wave (25°C versus 15°C) on life history (reproduction, size) and constitutive immune defence traits (phenoloxidase-like and antibacterial activity of haemolymph) in relation to inbreeding by manipulating the mating type (outcrossing, self-fertilization) in two populations of a hermaphroditic freshwater snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. High temperature increased reproduction and size of snails but impaired their immune function. In one of the two study populations, inbreeding reduced reproductive output of snails indicating inbreeding depression. Furthermore, this effect did not depend on the temperature snails were exposed to. Our results suggest that L. stagnalis snails can be negatively affected by inbreeding but it may not alter their responses to heat waves.

T1  - Essay: Making the most of recent advances in freshwater mussel propagation and restoration
AN  - 2348242258
AB  - Propagating and releasing freshwater mussels (Unionida) into the wild can contribute substantially to conservation and perhaps ecosystem restoration, but poorly conceived projects can waste money and public good will, and harm mussel populations and ecosystems. Moving from vague, emotional reactions about mussel restoration to more rigorous discussions and analyses can help focus efforts to where they do the most good. We suggest that: (i) projects to restore mussels for conservation goals to sites where known environmental problems have been eliminated or mitigated have good prospects for success; (ii) projects to restore mussels for conservation goals to sites where known environmental problems have not been eliminated or mitigated have poor prospects for success; (iii) projects to restore mussels for conservation goals to sites in the common situation in which the status of environmental problems is unknown have unknown prospects for success, but may be valuable as scientific experiments, if project performance is monitored properly; (iv) the value of population augmentation as a conservation tool is uncertain, and needs better theoretical and empirical analysis; (v) assisted migration of mussels as a conservation tool is controversial, and should be discussed thoroughly before we reach crises in which it is rejected or carried out carelessly; (vi) projects to restore ecosystem services face more stringent criteria for success than conservation projects, and some such projects being discussed seem unlikely to succeed. Monitoring data on how restoration projects perform typically are inadequately collected, reported, disseminated, and used to improve practice. This could be improved by setting up a clearinghouse to collect, hold, and disseminate data; providing training to restorationists; and opening conversations between restorationists and data managers and statisticians.

T1  - Antagonistic Interactions between Benzo[a]pyrene and Fullerene (C60) in Toxicological Response of Marine Mussels
AN  - 2302202130
AB  - This study aimed to assess the ecotoxicological effects of the interaction of fullerene (C60) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) on the marine mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. The uptake of nC60, B[a]P and mixtures of nC60 and B[a]P into tissues was confirmed by Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS), Liquid Chromatography–High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC–HRMS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (ICP–MS). Biomarkers of DNA damage as well as proteomics analysis were applied to unravel the interactive effect of B[a]P and C60. Antagonistic responses were observed at the genotoxic and proteomic level. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were only identified in the B[a]P single exposure and the B[a]P mixture exposure groups containing 1 mg/L of C60, the majority of which were downregulated (~52%). No DEPs were identified at any of the concentrations of nC60 (p < 0.05, 1% FDR). Using DEPs identified at a threshold of (p < 0.05; B[a]P and B[a]P mixture with nC60), gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis indicated that these proteins were enriched with a broad spectrum of biological processes and pathways, including those broadly associated with protein processing, cellular processes and environmental information processing. Among those significantly enriched pathways, the ribosome was consistently the top enriched term irrespective of treatment or concentration and plays an important role as the site of biological protein synthesis and translation. Our results demonstrate the complex multi-modal response to environmental stressors in M. galloprovincialis.

T1  - Aromatisation of steroids in the bivalve Mytilus trossulus
AN  - 2229587242
AB  - In this study, we demonstrated the presence of the enzymatic complex able to perform aromatization (estrogen synthesis) in both, the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions of gills and gonads from Mytilus trossulus. Based on in vitro experiments, we highlighted the importance of temperature as the limiting factor of aromatisation efficiency (AE) in mussels. After testing range of temperatures (4–23 °C), the highest AE was found during incubation at 8 °C and pH 7.6 (41.66 pmol/h/mg protein in gills and 58.37 pmol/h/mg protein in gonads). The results were confirmed during field studies where the most efficient aromatisation occurred in bivalves collected in spring while the least effective in those collected in winter. During in vitro studies, AE turned out to be more intensive in female gonads than in male gonads. The process was also more intensive in mitochondrial fraction than in microsomal one (62.97 pmol/h/mg protein in male gills and 73.94 pmol/h/mg protein in female gonads). Enzymatic complex (aromatase-like enzyme) catalysing aromatisation in mussels was found to be insensitive to inhibitory effect of selective inhibitors of mammalian aromatase such as letrozole and anastrazole, suggesting its different structure from vertebrate aromatase. Further in vivo studies using 13C-labeled steroids at 8 °C temperature window confirmed that bivalves are able to uptake testosterone and androstenedione from the ambient environment and metabolise them to estrone and 17β-estradiol thus confirming endogenous estrogen’ synthesis.

T1  - 3D Printing: Applications in evolution and ecology
AN  - 2267118937
AB  - In the commercial and medical sectors, 3D printing is delivering on its promise to enable a revolution. However, in the fields of Ecology and Evolution we are only on the brink of embracing the advantages that 3D printing can offer. Here we discuss examples where the process has enabled researchers to develop new techniques, work with novel species, and to enhance the impact of outreach activities. Our aim is to showcase the potential that 3D printing offers in terms of improved experimental techniques, greater flexibility, reduced costs and promoting open science, while also discussing its limitations. By taking a general overview of studies using the technique from fields across the broad range of Ecology and Evolution, we show the flexibility of 3D printing technology and aim to inspire the next generation of discoveries.

T1  - Long-term fish assemblages of the Ohio River: Altered trophic and life history strategies with hydrologic alterations and land use modifications
AN  - 2214467007
AB  - Long-term monitoring of species assemblages provides a unique opportunity to test hypotheses regarding environmentally induced directional trajectories of freshwater species assemblages. We used 57 years of lockchamber fish rotenone and boat electrofishing survey data (1957–2014) collected by the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO) to test for directional trajectories in taxonomy, trophic classifications, and life history strategies of freshwater fish assemblages in the Ohio River Basin. We found significant changes in taxonomic and trophic composition of freshwater fishes in the Ohio River Basin. Annual species richness varied from 31 to 90 species and generally increased with year. Temporal trajectories were present for taxonomic and trophic assemblages. Assemblage structure based on taxonomy was correlated with land use change (decrease in agriculture and increase in forest). Taxonomic assemblage structure was also correlated with altered hydrology variables of increased minimum discharge, decreased fall rate, and increased rise rate. Trophic composition of fish catch correlated with land use change (decrease in agriculture and increase in forest) and altered hydrology. Altered hydrology of increased minimum discharge, increased fall discharge, decreased base flows, and increased number of high pulse events was correlated with increased counts of herbivore-detritivores and decreased counts of piscivores and planktivores. We did not find directional changes in life history composition. We hypothesized a shift occurred from benthic to phytoplankton production throughout the basin that may have decreased secondary production of benthic invertebrates. This may also be responsible for lower trophic position of invertivore and piscivore fishes observed in other studies.

T1  - Effects of hypoxia on survival, behavior, metabolism and cellular damage of Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum)
AN  - 2211527999
AB  - The Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum has become a common and dominant macrobenthic species in coastal areas of the northwestern Pacific and temperate waters of Europe; it is also a major cultured shellfish, with annual worldwide production exceeding 3.3 million tonnes. This species faces greater risk of exposure to hypoxia as eutrophication worsens throughout its coastal habitats; however, its tolerance to hypoxia remains unclear, and the toxicological indicators including LC50 and LT50 have not yet been assessed. Previous studies on the effects of hypoxia on marine benthos have focused largely on functional responses, such as metabolism and gene expression, leaving potential structural damage to the mitochondria or the cells unknown. In this study we assessed the effects of hypoxia on Manila clam in terms of survival, behavior, metabolism and cellular damage, using a newly designed automated hypoxia simulation device that features exceptional accuracy and good stability. The clams exhibited strong tolerance to hypoxia as the 20-day LC50 for dissolved oxygen (DO) was estimated to be 0.57 mg L-1, and the LT50 at 0.5 mg L-1 DO was 422 hours. Adaptations included fewer buried clams and a depressed metabolism, while the unexpected rise in the activities of key enzymes involved in glycolysis may indicate a diverse strategy of shellfish under hypoxia. Cellular damage was observed as collapse of the mitochondrial cristae and both cellular and mitochondrial vacuolization. This multi-level study complements and updates our knowledge of the effects of hypoxia on marine benthos, by improving our understanding of the potential for marine ecological transformation under hypoxic conditions and providing useful information for Manila clam farming.

T1  - Impacts of Micro- and Nano-Sized Plastic Particles on Benthic Invertebrates: A Literature Review and Gap Analysis
AN  - 2284143094
AB  - As documented by the numerous publications that have appeared in recent years, plastic pollution of the environment and the effects on the respective ecosystems are currently one of the most intensely discussed issues in environmental science and in society at large. Of special concern are the effects of micro- and nano-sized plastics. A key issue in understanding the fate and potential effects of micro- and nano-sized plastics is their dynamic nature, as the size, shape, and charge of the particles change over time. Moreover, due to various biological processes, such as the aggregation of organic material and/or bacteria (“biofouling”), the density of plastic particles that settle in the sediments of aquatic ecosystems may be several orders of magnitudes higher than that in the surrounding waters. Consequently, the risk posed by plastic pollution to benthic fauna is considerably high. Nonetheless, the vast majority of studies examining the effects of microplastics have focused on pelagic organisms so far. We therefore conducted a comprehensive literature review to examine the impact of micro- and nano-sized plastics on benthic invertebrates, including the physical and chemical effects of leaching and the interactions of plastic particles with contaminants. Overall, 330 papers were reviewed for their fulfilment of different criteria (e.g. test species, plastic material, particle shape, particle size, exposure concentration, exposure route, assay type, assay duration), with 49 publications finally included in our survey. A comprehensive gap-analysis on the effects of plastic particles on benthic invertebrates, revealed a wide variety of effects triggered by micro- and/or nano-sized plastics but also distinct differences regarding the plastic materials tested, the size fractions applied, the shape of the respective particles and the exposure routes tested. Our review concludes with a discussion of the important research gaps concerning freshwater ecosystems and recommendations for future areas of research.

T1  - Developmental Toxicity of Microplastic Leachates on Marine Larvae
AN  - 2827704056
AB  - Marine plastic pollution is now considered a diverse contaminant suite, differing in product origin, polymer composition, size, morphology, colour, additives and environmental cocontaminants. The environmental hazards associated with marine plastic pollution have been widely documented, however much of the existing research has yet to document developmental abnormalities observed when biota develop in plastic contaminated systems. The effect of microplastic leachate exposure on two marine echinoderms early developmental stages were investigated. Psammechinus milaris and Paracentrotus lividus embryonic and larval cultures were exposed to leachates derived from industrial or environmental exposed plastic pellets to investigate the effect of polymer additives and environmental contaminants. Toxicity was evaluated morphologically using images of live embryos and larvae, along with immunostaining of key developmental tissue groups to determine the extent of impact on a physiological level. This body of work suggests that leachates from pellets exposed to environmental contaminates (biobead and pre-production nurdle pellets) and highly plasticised industrial pellets (polyvinyl chloride) elicit severe, consistent and treatment-specific phenotypes in P. lividus embryonic and larval developmental stages, with impacts on morphogenic processes. Key differences in larvae morphology were documented between plastic types and environmental exposure. Industrial polyvinyl chloride pellets elicited the most pronounced abnormalities from the wild type at 24 hours post-fertilisation. However, leachates from un-plasticised industrial polyethylene pellets showed little differences from the wildtype with regards to developmental timing and abnormalities. Leachates from environmental sourced pellets elicited the most severe developmental delays and abnormalities at 48 hours post-fertilisation. Preliminary chemical analysis was also performed on industrial and beached pellet leachates, to investigate compound composition and to determine possible contributors to the developmental defects. To summarise, the findings suggest industrial and environmental microplastic leachate exposure elicits morphological malformations and specific abnormalities in neural, cilia and muscle tissues groups in both embryonic and larval stages of marine larvae of P. lividus. However, more research and investigation are needed to draw conclusive data.

T1  - Towards a Visipedia: Combining Computer Vision and Communities of Experts
AN  - 2823460906
AB  - Motivated by the idea of a Visipedia, where users can search and explore by image, this thesis presents tools and techniques for empowering expert communities through computer vision. The collective aim of this work is to provide a scalable foundation upon which an application like Visipedia can be built. We conduct experiments using two highly motivated communities, the birding community and the naturalist community, and report results and lessons on how to build the necessary components of a Visipedia. First, we conduct experiments analyzing the behavior of state-of-the-art computer vision classifiers on long tailed datasets. We find poor feature sharing between classes, potentially limiting the applicability of these models and emphasizing the ability to intelligently direct data collection resources. Second, we devise online crowdsourcing algorithms to make dataset collection for binary labels, multiclass labels, keypoints, and mulit-instance bounding boxes faster, cheaper, and more accurate. These methods jointly estimate labels, worker skills, and train computer vision models for these tasks. Experiments show that we can achieve significant cost savings compared to traditional data collection techniques, and that we can produce a more accurate dataset compared to traditional data collection techniques. Third, we present two fine-grained datasets, detail how they were constructed, and analyze the test accuracy of state-of-the-art methods. These datasets are then used to create applications that help users identify species in their photographs: Merlin, an app assisting users in identifying birds species, and iNaturalist, an app that assists users in identifying a broad variety of species. Finally, we present work aimed at reducing the computational burden of large scale classification with the goal of creating an application that allows users to classify tens of thousands of species in real time on their mobile device. As a whole, the lessons learned and the techniques presented in this thesis bring us closer to the realization of a Visipedia.

T1  - Do native white-clawed crayfish impact macroinvertebrate assemblages in Mediterranean limestone headwaters?
AN  - 2582791430
AB  - Crayfish are among the largest aquatic macroinvertebrates in rivers and streams. Their trophic ecology is important for the understanding of the functioning of benthic communities. This is relevant in key areas, such as headwaters, as they partly condition the processes occurring downstream. To shed light on the effects of native white-clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes, on local macroinvertebrate assemblages from running headwaters, a three-month mesocosm-based field study was designed. Collection and subsequent analysis of benthic samples under different crayfish density levels yielded a set of metrics indicative of short-term impacts at general and taxonomic scales. Neither significant positive nor negative effects on the community were evident in terms of richness, diversity, dominance and biomass. A combination of highly patched distributions of macroinvertebrates along with a weak impact of crayfish foraging activity is considered to explain this lack of effects. Only temporal changes associated with particular biological cycles appeared for some of the main taxa. Based on the results, we are not able to determine whether the white-clawed crayfish perceptibly disturbs the structure and composition of the local macroinvertebrate assemblages in the short-term. Thus, its use in future restocking projects is supported.Alternate abstract: Les écrevisses sont parmi les plus gros macroinvertébrés aquatiques dans les rivières et les ruisseaux. Leur écologie trophique est importante pour la compréhension du fonctionnement des communautés benthiques. C'est pertinent dans des domaines clés, tels que les eaux d'amont, car elles conditionnent en partie les processus qui se produisent en aval. Pour faire la lumière sur les effets de l'écrevisse à pieds blancs, Austropotamobius pallipes, sur les assemblages de macroinvertébrés locaux des eaux d'amont, une étude de trois mois en mésocosme sur le terrain a été conçue. Collecte et analyse d'échantillons benthiques selon les niveaux de densité différentes en écrevisses ont donné un ensemble de paramètres indicatifs des impacts à court terme à l'échelle générale et taxonomique. Aucun effet positif ou négatif important sur la communauté n'était évident en termes de richesse, de diversité, de dominance et de biomasse. On considère que cette absence d'effets s'explique par la combinaison d'une distribution de macroinvertébrés très hétérogène et d'un faible impact de l'activité de recherche de nourriture des écrevisses. Seuls des changements temporels associés à des cycles biologiques particuliers sont apparus pour certains des principaux taxons. D'après les résultats, nous ne sommes pas en mesure de déterminer si l'écrevisse à pattes blanches perturbe à court terme de façon perceptible la structure et la composition des assemblages locaux de macroinvertébrés. Ainsi, son utilisation dans les futurs projets de repeuplement est confortée.

T1  - Phosphorus Availability and Growth of Benthic Primary Producers in Littoral Lake Sediments: Are Differences Linked to Induced Bank Filtration?
AN  - 2550463563
AB  - Submerged macrophytes and periphyton are benthic primary producers that play an important role for several ecosystem functions of lakes. Their growth often depends on the availability of phosphorus (P) in sediments and overlying water. This P availability is assumed to potentially be affected by induced bank filtration (IBF), a cost-effective method for drinking water production. In this study, we tested whether littoral sediments sampled at sites with high and low influence of IBF in a temperate eutrophic lake used for bank filtration since more than 100 years affects periphyton and macrophyte growth. Sediments differed in aerobic desorbed water-soluble phosphorus (PH2O) and iron (Fe) content and the growth of macrophytes in sediments with a high impact of IBF was lower compared to sediments with low impact of IBF. We also found that P addition to the nutrient solution increased periphyton growth and that periphyton limited macrophyte growth. While these results point to a potential impact of IBF on P availability in sediments that can cascade to benthic primary producers, we could not prove mechanistic links between high rates of IBF and the lower macrophyte growth. Additional research to assure a sustainable application of this valuable drinking water production method is therefore needed.

T1  - Meteorological and Nutrient Conditions Influence Microcystin Congeners in Freshwaters
AN  - 2550279286
AB  - Cyanobacterial blooms increasingly impair inland waters, with the potential for a concurrent increase in cyanotoxins that have been linked to animal and human mortalities. Microcystins (MCs) are among the most commonly detected cyanotoxins, but little is known about the distribution of different MC congeners despite large differences in their biomagnification, persistence, and toxicity. Using raw-water intake data from sites around the Great Lakes basin, we applied multivariate canonical analyses and regression tree analyses to identify how different congeners (MC-LA, -LR, -RR, and -YR) varied with changes in meteorological and nutrient conditions over time (10 years) and space (longitude range: 77°2′60 to 94°29′23 W). We found that MC-LR was associated with strong winds, warm temperatures, and nutrient-rich conditions, whereas the equally toxic yet less commonly studied MC-LA tended to dominate under intermediate winds, wetter, and nutrient-poor conditions. A global synthesis of lake data in the peer-reviewed literature showed that the composition of MC congeners differs among regions, with MC-LA more commonly reported in North America than Europe. Global patterns of MC congeners tended to vary with lake nutrient conditions and lake morphometry. Ultimately, knowledge of the environmental factors leading to the formation of different MC congeners in freshwaters is necessary to assess the duration and degree of toxin exposure under future global change.

T1  - Influence of accuracy, repeatability and detection probability in the reliability of species-specific eDNA based approaches
AN  - 2344211405
AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) barcoding has a high potential to increase the cost-efficiency of species detection and monitoring in aquatic habitats. However, despite vast developments in the field, many published assays often lack detailed validation and there is little to no commonly (agreed upon) standardization of protocols. In this study, we evaluated the reliability of eDNA detection and quantification using published primers and assays targeting the Freshwater Pearl Mussel as a model organism. We first assessed limits of detection for two different target genes (COI and 16S) following the MIQE guidelines, and then tested the reliability of quantification in a double-blind mesocosm experiment. Our results reveal that different methodological indicators, namely accuracy, repeatability and detection probability affected the reliability of eDNA measurement at the different levels tested. The selection of the optimal analytical method was mainly determined by detection probability. Both the COI and 16S assays were highly specific for the targeted organism and showed similar accuracy and repeatability, whilst the limit of detection was clearly lower for the COI based approach. In contrast, the reliability of eDNA quantification hinged on repeatability, reflected by the scattering (r2 = 0.87) around the relationship between eDNA and mussel density in mesocosms. A bootstrapping approach, which allowed for the assignment of measures associated with repeatability of samples, revealed that variability between natural replicates (i.e. accuracy) strongly influenced the number of replicates required for a reliable species detection and quantification in the field.

T1  - Outbreak of avian botulism and its effect on waterbirds in the Wilderness Lakes, South Africa
AN  - 2315012716
AB  - Avian botulism has been reported in many areas worldwide, particularly in North America, where at times it has resulted in die-offs of hundreds of thousands of waterbirds. By contrast, there are few reported cases in wild waterbird communities in South Africa. Mass die-offs of waterbirds in the Wilderness Lakes, South Africa, were first observed in January 2015, raising concerns about the effect of disease on the status of waterbird communities in this Ramsar site. Surveys of bird carcasses were undertaken between 2015 and 2017. An estimated 1115 individuals from 23 species were affected, with sick individuals displaying symptoms of avian type C, C and D or E botulism. The highest mortality was amongst red-knobbed coot (  Fulica cristata  ), Cape shoveler (  Anas smithii  ) and yellow-billed duck (  Anas undulata  ), respectively comprising 60%, 18% and 9% of affected individuals. Cape shoveler was found to be particularly susceptible to the disease. Deaths occurred mainly during summer and autumn (November–April). No mortalities were recorded amongst 44 waterbird species, of which common moorhen (  Gallinula choropus  ), African purple swamphen (  Porphyrio madagascariensis  ) and reed cormorant (  Phalacrocorax africanus  ) are widespread and abundant. The reasons for the outbreaks remain elusive, as environmental changes characteristic of a botulism outbreak, notably a decline in water level and dissolved oxygen, did not differ substantially from earlier years when no disease outbreaks were observed. The role of fish, and in particular the recently introduced common carp (  Cyprinus carpio  ) in the progression of the disease, remains speculative, although worthy of investigation. The removal of carcasses for disease control should be continued.
Conservation implications: The long-term effect of repeated outbreaks of avian botulism on the abundance of susceptible waterbird species in the Wilderness Lakes is of concern. The previous regular high abundance of duck species, particularly yellow-billed duck and Cape shoveler, was the initial reason for the Wilderness Lakes being declared a Ramsar site. The effect of ongoing high disease-related mortalities may, in part, prevent these wetlands from continuing to regularly support globally significant populations of some waterbird species. The containment of the disease must be attempted by the regular collection and removal of dead birds and fish during the outbreak periods of November–June, and carcasses should be disposed of off-site. Further testing of affected individuals should be undertaken and the monitoring of environmental variables and affected individuals continued to improve the understanding of the drivers and progression of the disease.

T1  - The Influence of Surface Coatings of Silver Nanoparticles on the Bioavailability and Toxicity to Elliptio complanata Mussels
AN  - 2295340225
AB  - Nanomaterials could be modified with various coatings which could modulate their behavior in the environment, bioavailability and toxicity. The purpose of this study was to determine if the selected coatings of silver nanoparticles (nAg) could influence the fate, bioavailability, and toxicity toward suspension feeding freshwater mussels, Elliptio complanata. Mussels were exposed for 96 h to 50 μg/L of nAg with the following surface coatings: citrate, silicate (Si), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and branched polyethylenimine (bPEI). After the exposure period, mussels were analyzed for total Ag, resistance to air emersion, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and autophagosome protein uptake (protein ubiquitinylation) in gills and digestive glands. The data revealed that citrate- and PVP-coated nAg were 2 times more abundant in the digestive gland compared to bPEI- and Si-coated nAg with estimated bioaccumulation factors between 5 and 10. The data revealed that tissue Ag levels were closely associated with air survival time, weight loss during air exposure, DNA strand breaks, LPO, and protein-ubiquitin levels in the digestive gland. The data supports the hypothesis that the coatings could influence bioavailability and toxicity in freshwater mussels.

T1  - Marine Pollution: Current Status, Impacts and Remedies
AN  - 2294667958
AB  - While oceans are vast, they represent a fragile resource that must be protected if we want to protect our livelihoods and our planet. Marine pollution has been a topic of concern for a long time, and it has recently attracted the attention of scientists, environmentalists, economists, politicians and journalists in mainstream media, . Besides providing food, transportation routes and other resources, the oceans serve as a heat absorbing sink which offsets the extreme heating effects of climate change, but only to a limited degree. Pollution in marine environments such as the oceans, poses a threat to coastal communities by affecting the fauna and flora in the environment and the health of the nearby population. This has a disruptive effect on the health and economy of these communities. Marine Pollution: Current Status, Impacts and Remedies emphasizes the limitations of marine resources that relevant environments provide. Readers will find chapters on methods to assess pollution as well as important information for identifying, measuring, and remediating various pollutants. The book also covers some known pollutants (heavy metals, organic pollutants, microplastics) and ways to manage these substances. Other issues covered in the book include problems caused by invasive species, and the ecological problems caused by pollutants which affect local fauna and flora. This book will prove to be a useful resource for students, researchers, and policymakers, who are working in environmental science, marine conservation and allied fields.

T1  - Mollusc species from the Pontocaspian region – an expert opinion list
AN  - 2282407270
AB  - Defining and recording the loss of species diversity is a daunting task, especially if identities of species under threat are not fully resolved. An example is the Pontocaspian biota. The mostly endemic invertebrate faunas that evolved in the Black Sea – Caspian Sea – Aral Sea region and live under variable salinity conditions are undergoing strong change, yet within several groups species boundaries are not well established. Collection efforts in the past decade have failed to produce living material of various species groups whose taxonomic status is unclear. This lack of data precludes an integrated taxonomic assessment to clarify species identities and estimate species richness of Pontocaspian biota combining morphological, ecological, genetic, and distribution data. In this paper, we present an expert-working list of Pontocaspian and invasive mollusc species associated to Pontocaspian habitats. This list is based on published and unpublished data on morphology, ecology, anatomy, and molecular biology. It allows us to (1) document Pontocaspian mollusc species, (2) make species richness estimates, and (3) identify and discuss taxonomic uncertainties. The endemic Pontocaspian mollusc species richness is estimated between 55 and 99 species, but there are several groups that may harbour cryptic species. Even though the conservation status of most of the species is not assessed or data deficient, our observations point to deterioration for many of the Pontocaspian species.

T1  - Successful Operational Cyber Security Strategies for Small Businesses
AN  - 2247851822
AB  - Cybercriminals threaten strategic and efficient use of the Internet within the business environment. Each year, cybercrimes in the United States cost business leaders approximately $6 billion, and globally, $445 billion. The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore the operational strategies chief information security officers of high-technology companies used to protect their businesses from cyberattacks. Organizational learning theory was the conceptual framework for the study. The population of the study was 3 high-technology business owners operating in Florida who have Internet expertise and successfully protected their businesses from cyberattacks. Member checking and methodological triangulation were used to valid the data gathered through semistructured interviews, a review of company websites, and social media pages. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, which supported the identification of 4 themes: effective leadership, cybersecurity awareness, reliance on third-party vendors, and cybersecurity training. The implications of this study for positive social change include a safe and secure environment for conducting electronic transactions, which may result in increased business and consumer confidence strengthened by the protection of personal and confidential information. The creation and sustainability of a safe Internet environment may lead to increased usage and trust in online business activities, leading to greater online business through consumer confidence and communication.

T1  - A conservation palaeobiological approach to assess faunal response of threatened biota under natural and anthropogenic environmental change
AN  - 2241207155
AB  - Palaeoecological records are required to test ecological hypotheses necessary for conservation strategies as short-term observations can insufficiently capture natural variability and identify drivers of biotic change. Here, we demonstrate the importance of an integrated conservation palaeobiology approach when making validated decisions for conservation and mitigating action. Our model system is the Razim–Sinoie lake complex (RSL) in the Danube Delta (Black Sea coast, Romania), a dynamic coastal lake system hosting unique Pontocaspian mollusc species that are now severely under threat. The Pontocaspians refer to an endemic species group that evolved in the Black Sea and Caspian Sea basins under reduced salinity settings over the past few million years. The natural, pre-industrial RSL contained a salinity gradient from fresh to mesohaline (18 ppm) until human intervention reduced the inflow of mesohaline Black Sea water into the lake system. We reconstruct the evolution of the RSL over the past 2000 years from integrated sedimentary facies and faunal analyses based on 11 age-dated sediment cores and investigate the response of mollusc species and communities to those past environmental changes. Three species associations (“marine”, “Pontocaspian” and “freshwater”) exist and their spatio-temporal shifts through the system are documented. Variable salinity gradients developed, with marine settings (and faunas) dominating in the southern part of the system and freshwater conditions (and faunas) in the northern and western parts. Pontocaspian species have mostly occurred in the centre of the RSL within the marine–freshwater salinity gradient. Today, freshwater species dominate the entire system, and only a single Pontocaspian species (Monodacna colorata) is found alive. We show that the human-induced reduced marine influence in the system has been a major driver of the decline of the endemic Pontocaspian biota. It urges improved conservation action by re-establishing a salinity gradient in the lake system to preserve these unique species.

T1  - The colonial ascidian Diplosoma listerianum enhances the occurrence of the hydrozoan Obelia sp. during early phases of succession
AN  - 2018638425
AB  - Recruitment patterns of sessile species often do not reflect the composition of the local propagule pool. This is, among other processes, attributed to the stimulation or inhibition of settlement by resident species. In an experimental study, we evaluated the effects of different densities of the ascidian Diplosoma listerianum on the settlement of the hydrozoan Obelia sp. For this, we monitored the cover of the dominant fouler Obelia sp. on vertically orientated PVC tiles, which were either bare or pre-seeded with two different densities (sparse or dense) of Diplosoma colonies, over the course of 8 weeks. The settlement tiles were deployed at two study sites in La Herradura Bay, Chile. The presence of D. listerianum enhanced the settlement or the growth or both of the colonial hydrozoan, but this effect disappeared within 4–8 weeks. Furthermore, we tested whether the initial enhancement of Obelia sp. by Diplosoma colonies goes back to the fact that larvae, which reject the ascidian tunic as a settlement substratum after a first contact, colonize nearby surfaces because of their limited mobility. However, we found no support for this assumption. We rather suggest that D. listerianum facilitated colonization indirectly by the accumulation of organic material in its vicinity and/or by its pumping activity. Initial resident-mediated enhancement of the hydrozoan was overridden by processes such as competition between later colonizers within the course of weeks and we could not detect any lasting effects of D. listerianum on the structure of the developing communities.

T1  - Effects of a treated sewage effluent on behavioural traits in Diamesa cinerella and Daphnia magna
AN  - 2417690403
AB  - Recently, the use of Daphnia magna has been proposed in on-line and real-time biomonitoring programmes as an early warning system for evaluating the effluent quality of sewage treatment plants (STPs). These systems are based on recording behavioural changes in the test organism resulting from the stress caused by the effluents. Indeed, altered behavioural signals could be induced at sublethal concentrations that are significantly lower than the corresponding EC50. However, at present, it is unknown whether the sensitivity of D. magna can be representative of that of other aquatic organisms, particularly benthic macroinvertebrates. An experiment was designed to verify whether D. magna can be employed in biomonitoring programmes for STPs located in alpine areas as a surrogate for cold freshwater best-adapted species. The responses of survival and behaviour alteration to exposure to the effluent of the Tonale Pass plant (Trentino, Italian Alps, 46°N, 10°E; 1799 m a.s.l.) were compared in a laboratory population of D. magna and a wild population of the chironomid Diamesa cinerella. These larvae were collected from the Vermigliana stream 50 metres upstream of the effluent input. Both organisms were exposed for 24 and 48 hrs to the effluent as it is and to three dilutions (/10, /100, /1000). The mortality rate and behavioural responses (using video tracking systems) were recorded. No significant mortality or change in behaviour was observed in the two species when exposed to the undiluted effluent. Exposure to serial dilutions of the treated effluent did not affect the survival of either species but notably altered their behaviour at both exposure times (e.g., the time spent in activity in D. magna and the average speed of movement and the cumulative distance travelled in both), especially when exposed to the ten-times-diluted effluent. Overall, the findings of this study emphasize that even though D. magna and D. cinerella use different behavioural strategies to cope with adverse environmental conditions, their overall sensitivity to treated effluents is similar. Accordingly, the use of D. magna in biological early warning systems protocols seems to also be sufficiently protective for local, cold-adapted species of alpine freshwater ecosystems.

T1  - Size‐selective fishing and the potential for fisheries‐induced evolution in lake whitefish
AN  - 2089816300
AB  - The long‐term evolutionary effects of fishing on maturation schedules can depend on gear type, the shape of the gear type's size‐selectivity function, and the size and age structure of a population. Our goal was to better understand how environmentally induced differences in somatic growth influence the evolutionary effects of size‐selective fisheries, using lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) in Lake Huron as a case study. Using a state‐dependent optimization model of energy allocation parameterized for lake whitefish, we show that fishing with gill nets (bell‐shaped selectivity) and trap nets (sigmoid‐shaped selectivity) can be potent agents of selection on size thresholds for maturity. Compared to trap nets and large mesh (114 mm) gill nets, small mesh (89 mm) gill nets are better able to buffer populations from fishing‐induced evolution by safeguarding large, fecund fish, but only when overall fishing mortality is low and growth rates sufficiently fast such that fish can outgrow vulnerable size classes. Regardless of gear type, and all else being equal, high fishing mortality in combination with low growth rates is expected to intensify the long‐term evolutionary effects of fishing.

T1  - Mapping risks of pest invasions based on the spatio-temporal distribution of hosts
AN  - 2287043414
AB  - Surveying multiple invasive pest species at the same time can help reduce the cost of detecting new pest invasions. In this paper, we describe a new method for mapping the relative likelihood of pest invasion via plant propagation material in a geographic setting. The method simulates the invasion of a range of pest species, including arrival in an uninvaded area, spread, and survival in a novel landscape, using information on the spatial and temporal distribution of the suitable host crop species and tentative knowledge of the spread and survival capacities of the target pests. The methodology is applied to a gridded map in which each map cell represents a site in a landscape. The method uses stochastic simulations to depict plausible realizations of the invasion outcomes and estimate the distribution of pest invasion likelihood for each cell in the area of concern. The method then prioritizes the cells based on the stochastic invasion outcomes using a pairwise stochastic dominance rule and a hypervolume indicator. We demonstrate the approach by assessing the relative likelihood of pest invasion for strawberry production in Finland. Our method helps to differentiate sites in a landscape using both the estimates of pest invasion risk and their uncertainty. It can be applied to prioritize sites for plant health surveys and allocate survey resources among large geographic regions. The approach is generalizable and can be used in situations where knowledge of the harmful pest species is poor or nonexistent.

T1  - Routes towards Novel Collagen-Like Biomaterials
AN  - 2125300855
AB  - Collagen plays a major role in providing mechanical support within the extracellular matrix and thus has long been used for various biomedical purposes. Exemplary, it is able to replace damaged tissues without causing adverse reactions in the receiving patient. Today’s collagen grafts mostly are made of decellularized and otherwise processed animal tissue and therefore carry the risk of unwanted side effects and limited mechanical strength, which makes them unsuitable for some applications e.g., within tissue engineering. In order to improve collagen-based biomaterials, recent advances have been made to process soluble collagen through nature-inspired silk-like spinning processes and to overcome the difficulties in providing adequate amounts of source material by manufacturing collagen-like proteins through biotechnological methods and peptide synthesis. Since these methods also open up possibilities to incorporate additional functional domains into the collagen, we discuss one of the best-performing collagen-like type of proteins, which already have additional functional domains in the natural blueprint, the marine mussel byssus collagens, providing inspiration for novel biomaterials based on collagen-silk hybrid proteins.

T1  - Novel crab predator causes marine ecosystem regime shift
AN  - 2024481628
AB  - The escalating spread of invasive species increases the risk of disrupting the pathways of energy flow through native ecosystems, modify the relative importance of resource (‘bottom-up’) and consumer (‘top-down’) control in food webs and thereby govern biomass production at different trophic levels. The current lack of understanding of interaction cascades triggered by non-indigenous species underscores the need for more basic exploratory research to assess the degree to which novel species regulate bottom-up and/or top down control. Novel predators are expected to produce the strongest effects by decimating consumers, and leading to the blooms of primary producers. Here we show how the arrival of the invasive crab Rhithropanopeus harrisii into the Baltic Sea – a bottom-up controlled ecosystem where no equivalent predators ever existed – appeared to trigger not only strong top-down control resulting in a decline in richness and biomass of benthic invertebrates, but also an increase in pelagic nutrients and phytoplankton biomass. Thus, the addition of a novel interaction – crab predation – to an ecosystem has a potential to reduce the relative importance of bottom-up regulation, relax benthic-pelagic coupling and reallocate large amounts of nutrients from benthic to pelagic processes, resulting in a regime shift to a degraded ecosystem state.

T1  - Rapid expansion of the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (O. F. Müller, 1774): a new alien species in the mollusk community of the Vistula
AN  - 2469835122
AB  - A new large population of the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (O. F. Müller, 1774) was found within a reach (ca 210 km long) of one of the largest European rivers, the Vistula. The largest population and the largest individuals were found at the outlet of a channel collecting heated water from the cooling process at the Połaniec power station and adjacent parts of the river. In the northern part of the study area, bivalves occurred at the channel margins, in groyne fields, and in the shallows of sand banks or sandbars. The clams were less numerous in places where the river was regulated with straightened banks and stone ripraps. Twenty-five other taxa of mollusks were found altogether at the sampling stations where Corbicula was observed, including other non-indigenous mollusk species.

T1  - Water quality impacts of small-scale hydromodification in an urban stream in Connecticut, USA
AN  - 2023984492
AB  - IntroductionConstruction activities in and along urban streams increase the sediment input into surface waters, causing an overall decline in water quality and aquatic ecosystems. In this case study, we investigate the water quality impacts of local hydromodification in an urban stream (discharge 0.4 m3/s). At the site of interest, workers removed a stream crossing consisting of an embankment with culverts and replaced it with a small bridge (single span of 25 m) in an effort to improve flow capacity.MethodsWater samples were taken at four sites along the North Branch Park River in Connecticut, Northeastern United States. Turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured in situ, and nitrate and total phosphorus (TP) were measured in the laboratory. Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were also collected and analyzed for taxon richness and Shannon-Weaver species diversity. Data were compared between upstream and downstream sites and before, during, and after hydromodification. We used one-way ANOVA combined with the post hoc Turkey test to derive statistical significance.ResultsDuring construction, turbidity increased temporarily by 60.9% [from 2.48 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) over ambient to 4.00 NTU]. Once construction was completed, DO increased locally from 11.0 to 13.0 mg/L. Benthic macroinvertebrate taxon richness and species diversity declined by 61.6 and 32.6% respectively, with no recovery observed in the year following construction. Water quality was only affected within 50 m downstream. Nitrate and TP concentrations were unaffected.ConclusionsSmall-scale hydromodification temporarily increased the turbidity as a result of increased sediment input, approaching the maximum level for clean water (5 NTU). Benthic macroinvertebrate communities declined in the immediate downstream vicinity of construction but are expected to recover soon given that turbidity recovered to pre-construction levels, and DO increased. These outcomes emphasize that environmental assessment is important not only for large-scale hydromodification but also for smaller scale stream modifications.

T1  - Microplastics Reduce Short-Term Effects of Environmental Contaminants. Part I: Effects of Bisphenol A on Freshwater Zooplankton Are Lower in Presence of Polyamide Particles
AN  - 2014803423
AB  - Microplastics can have direct physical effects on organisms in freshwater systems, and are considered as vectors for absorbed environmental pollutants. It is still under discussion if microplastics are relevant pollutant vectors for uptake into aquatic organisms in comparison to further uptake pathways, e.g., via water or sediment particles. We analyzed how the presence of microplastics (polyamide particles, PA) modifies acute effects of the environmental pollutant bisphenol A (BPA) on freshwater zooplankton (Daphnia magna). Daphnids were exposed to PA particles and BPA alone, before combining them in the next step with one concentration of PA and varying concentrations of BPA. The PA particles themselves did not induce negative effects, while the effects of BPA alone followed a typical dose-dependent manner. Sorption of BPA to PA particles prior to exposure led to a reduction of BPA in the aqueous phase. The combination of BPA and PA led to decreased immobilization, although PA particles loaded with BPA were ingested by the daphnids. Calculations based on physiochemistry and equilibrium assumptions indicated lower BPA body burden of daphnids in the presence of PA particles. These results confirm model-based studies, and show that investigated microplastic concentrations are negligible for the overall pollutant uptake of daphnids with water as additional uptake pathway.

T1  - Socio-Cultural Factors Influencing the use of ICT in Intermediate Schools in Saudi Arabia
AN  - 2827704235
AB  - Culture has been widely reported as a major factor affecting teachers‘ use of information and communication technology (ICT). However, culture cannot be analysed at a single level . This study used three levels of culture, classroom, school and national levels, to analyse teachers‘ use of ICT. The study investigates the socio-cultural factors that influence students‘ and language teachers‘ usage of ICT in their schools and how students and language teachers use ICT in their schools. The study was undertaken within the interpretive paradigm and adopted and integrated several theories: sociocultural theory, ecological perspective, Hofstede‘s model, and a metaphor from the Concern Based Adoption Model (CBAM). A multiple case study design was employed to yield detailed data to assist in understanding the use of ICT in schools. Classroom observation, teachers‘ semi-structured interviews, and focus groups were conducted to collect data. The sample was composed of six English teachers, five Arabic teachers, three school leaders, three supervisors, and twenty students aged between thirteen to fifteen years old taking part in four focus groups. Participants were selected from three intermediate boys‘ schools in Arrass city in Saudi Arabia. The study suggested a new framework that helps determine the level of teachers‘ use ICT based on the type of concerns. In teachers‘ decisions to use ICT in their classrooms, three types of concern 'self-concern, task concern and impact concern‘ emerged from the data analysis as influential factors. Self-concerns had the strongest effect in that teachers who had more self-concerns tended not to use ICT. Recommendations for policymakers and institutional practices are made.

T1  - Spéciation du Platine en Présence de Matière Organique Naturelle et Biodisponibilité pour L’algue Verte Chlamydomonas Reinhardtii
AN  - 2812054266
AB  - Les concentrations d’éléments du groupe platine mesurées dans l’environnement ont augmenté durant les dernières décennies. Cette augmentation est principalement causée par l’utilisation de ces métaux pour leurs propriétés physico-chimiques particulières dans les convertisseurs catalytiques des automobiles. Les recherches effectuées sur le platine et le palladium jusqu'à présent ont indiqué que ces éléments ont une toxicité potentiellement élevée pour les organismes aquatiques. La matière organique naturelle (MON) lie fortement les éléments du groupe platine, et peut donc modifier la biodisponibilité du platine et du palladium en les complexant. Ainsi, afin d’évaluer le risque environnemental de ces métaux en milieu aquatique naturel, la présence de ligands tels que la MON doit être considérée. L’objectif de ce projet était d’étudier la spéciation du platine et du palladium en présence de MON (Suwannee River humic acid) et de vérifier l’influence de la MON sur l’absorption et la toxicité de ces métaux chez l’algue verte unicellulaire Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. La première étape consistait donc à quantifier la complexation des métaux par la MON. Pour ce faire, deux méthodes ont été envisagées : la dialyse à l’équilibre et l’ultrafiltration partielle. La dialyse s’est avérée difficilement reproductible; c’est pourquoi l’ultrafiltration partielle est la technique qui a été privilégiée dans ce projet. La spéciation du palladium n’a pas pu être déterminée expérimentalement dû à une adsorption importante sur la verrerie utilisée (polycarbonate). La deuxième étape de ce projet consistait à exposer Chlamydomonas reinhardtii aux milieux caractérisés par ultrafiltration partielle et quantifier la bioaccumulation ainsi que les effets chez l’algue. Deux expositions d’une durée de 96 h en présence de 0 à 150 μg/L de platine non lié à la MON (platine ultrafiltré) ont été réalisées, l’une sans MON et l’autre en présence de 10 mg C/L de MON. Pour une gamme de concentrations de platine non lié à la matière organique similaire, il s’est avéré que le platine était plus toxique en présence de MON. En effet, le retard dans la croissance était plus important pour toutes les concentrations d’expositions et le rendement final était plus faible à des concentrations supérieures à 30 μg/L. L’internalisation de platine par Chlamydomonas reinhardtii était plus élevée lors de l’exposition en présence de MON et la valeur de CE₅₀ calculée à 48 h est environ cinq fois plus faible que celle obtenue en absence de MON.Alternate abstract:Concentrations of platinum-group elements measured in the environment have increased during the past decades. This increase is mainly due to the use of these elements for their unique properties in automotive catalytic converters. Previous research has reported that platinum and palladium can be toxic for aquatic organisms at very low concentrations. To evaluate the environmental risk of these elements in natural waters, ligands such as natural organic matter (NOM) need to be considered, because NOM can bind platinum-group elements and modify their bioavailability. The purpose of this project was to study the speciation of platinum and palladium in the presence of NOM (Suwannee River humic acid) and to verify the influence of NOM on the absorption and toxicity of these metals, using a unicellular green alga (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) as the test organism. The first step was to quantify the complexation of Pt and Pd by NOM. To this end, two methods were considered: equilibrium dialysis and partial ultrafiltration. Because results obtained by equilibrium dialysis were not reproducible, partial ultrafiltration was the technique selected for this project. Because palladium speciation could not be determined experimentally, due to significant adsorption on the polycarbonate glassware used, only platinum was used in the algal experiments. The second step of this project was to expose algae in media which had been characterized by partial ultrafiltration and to quantify platinum bioaccumulation and effects. Two exposures of 96 h in the presence of 0 to 150 μg/L of platinum not bound to NOM were carried out, one without NOM and the other one with 10 mg C/L of NOM. For a similar range of not bound to NOM concentrations, it was found that platinum was more toxic in the presence of NOM. For all exposure concentrations, the delay in growth was more substantial in the presence of NOM and the final yield was lower for platinum concentrations higher than 30 μg/L. For similar concentrations of ultrafilterable platinum, internalization by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was higher during the exposure with NOM than in the exposure without NOM, and the EC₅₀ calculated at 48 h was approximately five times lower than the EC₅₀ calculated for the exposure in the absence of NOM.

AN  - 2812053682
AB  - La mine Musselwhite se situe près du lac Opapimiskan dans le nord-ouest de l’Ontario, à 475 km au nord de la ville de Thunder Bay. En exploitation depuis 1997, plus de 4 Moz d’or y ont été produites. Le gisement d’or de classe mondiale Musselwhite est encaissé dans les formations de fer rubanées (FFR) polydéformées au faciès métamorphique des amphibolites de la ceinture de roches vertes mésoarchéenne (3.0-2.7 Ga) de North Caribou (CNC), dans le nord-ouest de la Province du Supérieur. Ce type de gisement est relativement rare et peu d’études se sont penchées sur la genèse et les contrôles régissant les mineralisations aurifères dans les FFR. Elles peuvent cependant former des gisements colossaux, comme l’illustre celui de Homestake de 40 Moz d’or, aux USA. Le présent projet constitue une étude multidisciplinaire de la géologie et de la métallogénie du gisement d’or Musselwhite, caractérisé à l’aide de données géologiques, structurales, pétrographiques et géochimiques.La NCG est majoritairement composée de basalte et komatiite tholéiitiques datés entre 3,05 et 2,91 Ga, recouvert de greywackes syn-orogéniques (<2,85 Ga). De larges batholithes de type TTG datés entre ca. 2,85 et ca. 2,73 Ga entourent la CNC. Trois phases principales de déformation ont affecté les roches de la CNC qui sont métamorphisées au faciès des amphibolites, daté à ca. 2660 Ma.Les étroites enveloppes sub-verticales de minerai sont encaissées dans la FFR à grunérite-grenat affectée par des zones de forte déformation D2 associées à des plis fermés à isoclinaux. La minéralisation aurifère épigénétique s’est formée sous des conditions métamorphiques de la zone à grenat, via un remplacement à pyrrhotite et une silicification de la FFR par des fluides issus de la dévolatilisation métamorphique des roches sous-jacentes. Elle est accompagnée d’une altération distale potassique (biotite) et proximale calcique (hornblende) remplaçant la grunérite dans la FFR. La teneur en or a une corrélation positive avec celles de l’Ag, du Cu, Se et Te. La minéralisation aurifère à Musselwhite est synchrone à la déformation D₂ et au métamorphisme M₂, et s’est mise en place entre 2720 et 2660 Ma.Le gisement Musselwhite comporte des éléments communs à d’autres gisements tels que Lupin (TNO, Canada), Homestake (USA), Nevoria (Australia), notamment le contrôle lithologique de la FFR silicatée sur l’or. Un tel horizon clé, un contexte structural complexe et de forts gradients de déformation sont des vecteurs d’explorations importants au sein de la CNC, du nord-ouest de la Province du Supérieur, et dans d’autres terrains métamorphisés précambriens.Alternate abstract:The Musselwhite mine is located near Opapimiskan Lake in northwestern Ontario, 475 km north of Thunder Bay. Over 4 Moz of gold have been produced since the start of operation in 1997. The world-class Musselwhite gold deposit is hosted by polydeformed, amphibolite-grade banded iron formations (BIF) in the Mesoarchean (3.0-2.7 Ga) North Caribou greenstone belt (NCG), in northwestern Superior Province. This deposit type is quite rare and few studies focused on their genesis and gold ore-forming processes. However, they can form large deposits, such as the Homestake mine (40 Moz of gold, USA). This project constitutes a multidisciplinary study of the geology and metallogeny of the Musselwhite gold deposit, using geological, structural, petrographic, and geochemical data.The NCG is mainly composed of tholeiitic basalts and komattites dated between 3.05 and 2.91 Ga, overlain by syn-orogenic greywackes (<2.85 Ga). Large TTG-type batholiths dated between 2.85 and 2.73 Ga surround the NCG. Three major phases of deformation affected rocks of the NCG, which were metamorphosed to amphibolite facies around 2660 Ma.Narrow sub-vertical ore zones are hosted by garnet-grunerite BIF in D2 high-strain zones associated with close to isoclinal folds. Epigenetic gold mineralization formed under garnet zone metamorphic conditions through pyrrhotite-replacement and silicification of the BIF by fluids stemming from metamorphic devolatilization of underlying rocks. It is accompanied by potassic (biotite) alteration and proximal calcic (hornblende) alteration of grunerite in the BIF. Gold grade is positively correlated with Ag, Cu, Se and Te. Gold mineralization at Musselwhite is synchronous to D₂ deformation and M₂ metamorphism, and was emplaced between 2720 and 2660 Ma.The Musselwhite deposit shows features common with other deposits such as Lupin (NWT, Canada), Homestake (USA), and Nevoria (Asutralia), notably the lithological control of silicate BIF on gold. Marker horizons, complex structural context, and strong deformation gradient are key exploration vectors in the NCG, the northwestern Superior Province, and other Precambrian terranes.

T1  - The colonial ascidian Diplosoma listerianum enhances the occurrence of the hydrozoan Obelia sp. during early phases of succession
AN  - 2575269216
AB  - Recruitment patterns of sessile species often do not reflect the composition of the local propagule pool. This is, among other processes, attributed to the stimulation or inhibition of settlement by resident species. In an experimental study, we evaluated the effects of different densities of the ascidian Diplosoma listerianum on the settlement of the hydrozoan Obelia sp. For this, we monitored the cover of the dominant fouler Obelia sp. on vertically orientated PVC tiles, which were either bare or pre-seeded with two different densities (sparse or dense) of Diplosoma colonies, over the course of 8 weeks. The settlement tiles were deployed at two study sites in La Herradura Bay, Chile. The presence of D. listerianum enhanced the settlement or the growth or both of the colonial hydrozoan, but this effect disappeared within 4–8 weeks. Furthermore, we tested whether the initial enhancement of Obelia sp. by Diplosoma colonies goes back to the fact that larvae, which reject the ascidian tunic as a settlement substratum after a first contact, colonize nearby surfaces because of their limited mobility. However, we found no support for this assumption. We rather suggest that D. listerianum facilitated colonization indirectly by the accumulation of organic material in its vicinity and/or by its pumping activity. Initial resident-mediated enhancement of the hydrozoan was overridden by processes such as competition between later colonizers within the course of weeks and we could not detect any lasting effects of D. listerianum on the structure of the developing communities.

T1  - Adopting a Gene Regulatory Network Approach to Investigate Toxicity Through the Adaptive Stress Response in Teleost Fish Species.
AN  - 2411490516
AB  - Given current risks of pollutant exposures in aquatic environments, there is a growing need to generate reliable computational risk assessment methods to establish how adverse outcomes can be produced across exposure organisms. The adaptive stress response is widely targeted by pollutants of concern and includes transcription factors including nuclear factor (erythroidderived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1α), heat shock factor (HSF1), nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated -B cells (NFkB), metal transcription factor 1 (MTF1), the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and tumor protein P53 (P53). While these TFs are known to be activated by distinct inducers, less is understood about the regulatory links between factors, particularly at the transcription factor (TF) DNA-binding level.In this thesis, a gene regulatory network (GRN) of adaptive-stress response factors that are key targets of chemical toxicity was constructed based on experimental evidence from mammalian cell-lines. The GRN was modeled using boolean logic and this identified a number of response outcomes that could be attributed to the activation of pathways including antioxidant defence processes and glucose metabolism. The GRN model illustrated that the activation of Nrf2, HIF-1α, AhR, MTF1 and HSF1 led to the same adverse outcomes, suggesting canalisation in stress response pathways.The ability to use GRNs across different species is widely supported by the identification of TF binding sites (TFBS) within target genes. To assess the efficiency of using the mammalian GRN across teleost fish species, a comprehensive analysis of validated binding sites for the AhR, MTF1, HIF-1α and Nrf2 was conducted across fish-species in comparison to the mammalian consensus binding sequence. This showed variations in binding site composition across validated TFBS for HIF-1α and Nrf2 in fish compared to the mammalian consensus, preventing the identification of the functional sequences for these factors using traditional methods. To establish if such changes affected the efficiency to predict positive downstream target genes for Nrf2 and HIF-1α in mammals and across teleost fish species, random forest classification models were used to compare the efficiency of multiple positional weight matrices (PWM) motifs of TFBS for Nrf2 and HIF-1α. Whilst the result from this analysis identified discrepancies in the ability to predict target genes based on the mammalian motif file used, mammalian motifs were able to predict target genes across fish species. Validated binding sites in fish species were then aligned to generate PWM motifs and sites were predicted across shared target genes hsp70 and hmox1 using both fish based and mammalian based models. This showed that whilst there was some overlap in identified sites across species, fish-specific motifs identified unique sites from mammalian models.

T1  - Littoral chironomids of a large Alpine lake: spatial variation and variables supporting diversity
AN  - 2161920004
AB  - Chironomidae are a major group of littoral secondary producers whose spatial changes in assemblage structures are shaped by diverse variables. Using their subfossil remains, we aimed at disentangling the relative impact of environmental, topographic, littoral occupation and hydrodynamic variables on the littoral assemblages as well as identifying taxa and sites of primary importance for the β-diversity in a large lake (Lake Bourget). A redundancy analysis coupled with a variance partitioning indicated that 22 % of the assemblage variability was explained by slope, carbonate concentration and littoral occupation. A non-negligible fraction of non-separable variance among these variables likely highlights the topographic constraint on anthropogenic development and environmental conditions. Taxonomic turnover overwhelmingly (93.2 %) dominated the assemblage changes indicating site-specific taxonomic composition. The taxa contribution to β-diversity was positively correlated with their mean abundances. The local abundances were either positively or negatively correlated with local contribution of sites to β-diversity (LCBD) providing evidence for different contributions of taxa to β-diversity. A couple of taxa (i.e. Cricotopus spp., Microtendipes sp. and Cladotanytarsus sp.) and sites (i.e. LB57, LB31, LB2) clearly supported the major variations of β-diversity and are therefore identified as being of primary importance regarding conservation programs. Both LCBD variations and taxa spatial autocorrelations suggest that chironomid assemblages were the most variable at a spatial-scale ranging from 500 m to 1 km, characterizing the spatial successions of littoral contexts. These results illustrate the need for considering short spatial scales to reveal the extent of the benthic diversity in the littoral areas of large lakes.
Les Chironomidae constituent un groupe important de producteurs secondaires littoraux dont les changements spatiaux dans les structures d'assemblage sont façonnés par diverses variables. À partir de leurs restes subfossiles, le rôle relatif des variables environnementales, topographiques, de l'occupation du littoral et de l'hydrodynamisme sur les assemblages littoraux a été recherché avant d'identifier les taxons et les sites de première importance pour la diversité β dans un grand lac alpin (le lac du Bourget). Une analyse de redondance couplée à un partitionnement de la variance a indiqué que 22 % de la variabilité des assemblages était expliquée par la pente, la concentration de carbonate et l'occupation du littoral. Une fraction non négligeable de la variance non séparable parmi ces variables met probablement en évidence l'effet de la contrainte topographique sur le développement anthropique et les conditions environnementales. Le renouvellement taxonomique a dominé les changements d'assemblage (93,2 %) mettant en évidence des compositions taxonomiques spécifiques pour les différents sites. La contribution des taxons à la diversité β était positivement corrélée à leur abondance moyenne, tandis que les abondances locales étaient corrélées positivement ou négativement à la contribution locale des sites à la diversité β (LCBD), suggérant différentes contributions des taxons à la diversité β. Un ensemble de taxons (Cricotopus spp., Microtendipes sp. et Cladotanytarsus sp.) et des sites (LB57, LB31, LB2) supportaient clairement les variations majeures de la diversité β et sont donc identifiés comme étant d'intérêt prioritaire pour des actions de conservation. Les variations de LCBD et les autocorrélations spatiales des taxons suggèrent que les assemblages de chironomes étaient les plus variables à une échelle spatiale allant de 500 m à 1 km, caractérisant les successions spatiales des contextes littoraux. Ces résultats illustrent la nécessité d'envisager de courtes échelles spatiales pour appréhender la diversité benthique dans les zones littorales des grands lacs alpins.

T1  - Delaware Inland Bays and Market Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) Quality for Consumption
AN  - 2058903477
AB  - Consumption of raw oysters is known to cause serious health conditions due to bioaccumulation of contaminants. As filter feeders, oysters ingest bacteria along with phytoplankton from their surrounding habitats. Ensuring seafood safety for human consumption is always a concern. Since oysters are consumed raw, disease causing organisms, environmental contaminants, toxins, chemicals, and even physical hazards such as soils and metals retained in the oysters can enter through feeding. The objective of this study was to determine the quality of oysters collected from Delaware Inland Bays (DIB) and compare them with market oysters. Environmental parameters were monitored from local waters of DIB classified as closed versus open for shellfish harvesting. Total aerobic bacteria and vibrio were higher in market oysters during the warmer months, with open water having the least microbial loads. There were no significant differences in total vibrio counts between the study sites (p=0.396), but significant differences were recorded over time (p=0.004). Water temperature and turbidity were directly proportional to total vibrio in oysters, and salinity was inversely related. Research findings in this study may help bring awareness of changes in bacterial loads due to seasonal changes and additional handling and storage.

T1  - Aquatic Toxic Analysis by Monitoring Fish Behavior Using Computer Vision: A Recent Progress
AN  - 2025315591
AB  - Video tracking based biological early warning system achieved a great progress with advanced computer vision and machine learning methods. Ability of video tracking of multiple biological organisms has been largely improved in recent years. Video based behavioral monitoring has become a common tool for acquiring quantified behavioral data for aquatic risk assessment. Investigation of behavioral responses under chemical and environmental stress has been boosted by rapidly developed machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we introduce the fundamental of video tracking and present the pioneer works in precise tracking of a group of individuals in 2D and 3D space. Technical and practical issues suffered in video tracking are explained. Subsequently, the toxic analysis based on fish behavioral data is summarized. Frequently used computational methods and machine learning are explained with their applications in aquatic toxicity detection and abnormal pattern analysis. Finally, advantages of recent developed deep learning approach in toxic prediction are presented.

T1  - Bioaccumulation of Heavy Metals in Water, Sediments, and Tissues and Their Histopathological Effects on Anodonta cygnea (Linea, 1876) in Kabul River, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan
AN  - 2014927894
AB  - The present investigation aimed to assess the concentrations of selected heavy metals in water and sediments and their bioaccumulation in tissues of freshwater mussels and their histopathological effects on the digestive gland, gills, and gonads of Anodonta cygnea. Water, sediments, and freshwater mussel samples were collected at four sites, that is, reference and polluted sites, along the Kabul River, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The polluted sites were receiving effluents from the industrial, agricultural, municipal, and domestic sources. The order of metals in the water was Zn>Pb>Ni>Cu>Mn>Fe>Cr>Cd, in sediments the order was Fe>Zn>Cr>Ni>Mn>Pb>Cu>Cd, and in the soft tissues the order was Fe>Zn>Mn>Pb>Cu>Cr>Ni>Cd. Histopathological alterations observed in polluted sites of Kabul River were inflammation, hydropic vacuolation, and lipofuscin pigments (in digestive gland), gill lamellar fusion, dilated hemolymphatic sinus, clumping, and generation of cilia and hemocytic infiltration (in gills), and atresia, necrosis, granulocytoma, hemocytic infiltration, and lipofuscin pigments (in gonads). The histopathological alterations in the organs of Anodonta cygnea can be considered as reliable biomarkers in biomonitoring of heavy metal pollution in aquatic ecosystems.

T1  - Allelopathic and Bloom-Forming Picocyanobacteria in a Changing World
AN  - 2002777097
AB  - Picocyanobacteria are extremely important organisms in the world’s oceans and freshwater ecosystems. They play an essential role in primary production and their domination in phytoplankton biomass is common in both oligotrophic and eutrophic waters. Their role is expected to become even more relevant with the effect of climate change. However, this group of photoautotrophic organisms still remains insufficiently recognized. Only a few works have focused in detail on the occurrence of massive blooms of picocyanobacteria, their toxicity and allelopathic activity. Filling the gap in our knowledge about the mechanisms involved in the proliferation of these organisms could provide a better understanding of aquatic environments. In this review, we gathered and described recent information about allelopathic activity of picocyanobacteria and occurrence of their massive blooms in many aquatic ecosystems. We also examined the relationships between climate change and representative picocyanobacterial genera from freshwater, brackish and marine ecosystems. This work emphasizes the importance of studying the smallest picoplanktonic fractions of cyanobacteria.

T1  - Variability of the reproductive cycle in estuarine and coastal populations of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. from the SE Bay of Biscay (Basque Country)
AN  - 2623490736
AB  - Mussel commercial production depends on wild populations to obtain the seed. Therefore, any new farming initiative needs deep knowledge on reproductive cycle of native mussel populations. The reproductive cycle of Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. from five sites, three estuarine and two coastal, along the coast of the Basque Country were assessed using gonad index and stereology over 2 consecutive years (2010 and 2011). Sex ratios, developmental stages of gonads , as well as reserve tissue cycle were analyzed. The onset of gametogenesis was observed from winter to spring, with spawning occurring from spring till summer. A resting phase followed with an increase in reserve tissues (adipogranular cells) was observed in fall. Mussels stayed ripe during winter until favorable environmental conditions were met in spring. Differences in reproductive cycles were found among populations, and also, year-to-year variability was observed within each population. In two of the studied sites asynchrony in the timing of spawning was observed between genders. These timing differences, however, did not prevent mussels at those sites from reproducing successfully. The Bidasoa estuary points to the potential of such studied sites for becoming the main source of wild mussel spats for future expected commercial mussel farming in the Basque Country. To ensure year-to-year maximum reproductive output, however, wild mussels harvest should be avoided from spring to the end of summer in this region.

T1  - Estimation of residual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons concentration in fish species: Implication in reciprocal corollary
AN  - 1994425417
AB  - The scientific evidence that aquatic animal’s model bio-concentrate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in their tissue has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. The worry is how much of these contaminants bio-concentrate in food and fish. This research investigates whether and to what extent residual PAHs bio-concentrate in—atlantic crocker (Micropogonias undulates), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), and yellow tail (Seriola lalandi). Twelve samples points were collected covering four kilometers along the Qua Ibeo river. They were quantitatively and qualitatively screened for PAHs concentration in water and in fish samples using gas chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy technique. Bio-concentration factor (BCF) was calculated via finding the ratio of mean PAHs concentration in fish to mean PAHs concentration in water. Results showed variable concentration of individual PAHs in water and in fish samples. Most apprehensively is the elevated concentration of some PAHs beyond permissible limit. And this call for worry or concern for public health and safety. The sixteen priority PAHs listed by the United State Environmental Protection Agency as carcinogenic were detected as: Naphthalene, 2-Methylnaphthalene, Acenaphthylene, Acenaphthene, Fluorene, Phenanthrene, Anthracene, Fluoranthene, Pyrene, Benzo (a) anthracene, Triphenylene, Benzo (e) pyrene, Benzo (a) pyrene, Indeno (1,2,3,cd) pyrene, Benzo (g,h,i) perylene, Dibenzo (a,h) anthracene, and 000053-70-3-benzo (e) pyrene, respectively.

T1  - Network Governance for Invasive Species Management
AN  - 2289705850
AB  - Invasive species management depends not only on biological and economic issues but also on how governance institutions influence cooperation from networks of stakeholders. We use the “contingency” framework for network governance to analyze why eradication of invasive Spartina in San Francisco Bay has been more successful than many other eradication efforts. The core argument is that invasive Spartina features antecedent conditions that favor a centralized network as the best governance approach, as demonstrated by a quantitative survey of Spartina stakeholders. This centralized policy network, with a clearly defined core of actors with the expertise, authority, and resources, produces effective cooperation. The contingency framework has implications for invasive species management more generally, as well as other conservation issues featuring dynamic spatial ecological processes.

T1  - Application of flow cytometry in ballast water analysis—biological aspects
AN  - 2287044668
AB  - Ballast water may, when discharged, cause the spread of nonindigenous and potentially invasive species. International ballast water treatment regulations have accelerated the development of new methods to detect, enumerate and assess the status of organisms in the water to be discharged. Flow cytometry (FCM) is a powerful technique with a broad range of applications with the possibility for multi-parametric analysis and the potential of combining it with other techniques being two strong advantages. This review will discuss whether FCM is suitable for ballast water analysis according to international ballast water regulations, and sum up the advantages and disadvantages. It will also give an overview of available labeling techniques. Finally, a discussion on the knowledge gaps and future potential for FCM within ballast water analysis is presented.

T1  - Experimental observations on the decay of environmental DNA from bighead and silver carps
AN  - 2287044527
AB  - Interest in the field of environmental DNA (eDNA) is growing rapidly and eDNA surveys are becoming an important consideration for aquatic resource managers dealing with invasive species. However, in order for eDNA monitoring to mature as a research and management tool, there are several critical knowledge gaps that must be filled. One such gap is the fate of eDNA materials in the aquatic environment. Understanding the environmental factors that influence the decay of eDNA and how these factors impact detection probabilities over time and space could have significant implications for eDNA survey design and data interpretation. Here we experimentally explore decay of eDNA associated with bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) biological waste collected from an aquaculture filtration system and with sperm collected from captive silver carp (H. molitrix), and how decay may be influenced by differing levels of water turbulence, temperature, microbial load, and pH. We found that the decay patterns of eDNA associated with both H. nobilis biological waste and H. molitrix milt significantly fit monophasic exponential decay curves. Secondly, we observed that the highest temperature we tested resulted in a decay half-life as much as 5.5× more rapid than the lowest temperature we tested. When we suppressed microbial loads in eDNA samples, we observed that overall losses of eDNA were reduced by about 2.5×. When we amended eDNA samples with pond water the half-life of eDNA was reduced by about 2.25×, despite relatively little apparent increase in the overall microbial load. This pattern indicated that species constituency of the microbial community, in addition to microbial load, might play a critical role in eDNA degradation. A shift in pH from 6.5 to 8.0 in the samples resulted in a 1.6× reduction in eDNA half-life. Water turbulence in our study had no apparent effect on eDNA decay. When we combined different temperature, pH, and microbial load treatments to create a rapid decay condition and a slow decay condition, and tracked eDNA decay over 91 days, we observed a 5.0× greater loss of eDNA by Day 5 under rapid decay conditions than under slow decay conditions. At the end of the trials, the differences in eDNA loss between the rapid decay and baseline and slow decay conditions were 0.1× and 3.3×, respectively. Our results strongly demonstrate the potential for environmental factors to influence eDNA fate and, thus, the interpretation of eDNA survey results.

T1  - The Green Menace:&nbsp;Emerald Ash Borer and the Invasive Species Problem
AN  - 2136028973
AB  - This volume is an account of the scientific and social responses made to the discovery of an invasive forest insect -- the emerald ash borer or EAB (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, 1888) -- in North America, that was formally announced in July 2002. Since its recognition, this wood-boring beetle has become one of the most destructive and costly exotic species ever encountered. More than $300 million in federal USDA-APHIS funds (alone) have been devoted to battling this pest, which has killed some tens of millions of ash trees, chiefly within southeastern Michigan and surrounding states. EAB has now been found in 28 states and two Canadian provinces. But those numbers are almost certain to keep growing in coming years.While primarily a case study, this work nonetheless examines larger issues concerning invasive species as a whole, their inadvertent transport and worldwide spread through the rise of globalization, regulations that have been adopted to prevent their introduction, and the successes or failures of state and federal agencies to try and enforce those regulations. It offers the first general work of its kind to appear on the ash borer that is directed towards a broad audience including the public, entomologists and foresters, environmentalists and ecologists, researchers, regulators, and indeed anyone who wishes to learn more about this important and timely topic. No previous knowledge of EAB or invasion biology is assumed.This book covers all of the major aspects of scientific research and management that have occurred since EAB was recognized in 2002. It is thoroughly researched and draws from the best available data and sources, which represent (a) archival materials; (b) scholarly publications and conference proceedings; (c) interviews conducted with leading participants in the EAB program; (d) selected newspaper/magazine articles; and (e) reputable sources found on the Internet (e.g., USDA-APHIS).

T1  - Denitrification potential of the eastern oyster microbiome using a 16S rRNA gene based metabolic inference approach
AN  - 1941349901
AB  - The eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is a foundation species providing significant ecosystem services. However, the roles of oyster microbiomes have not been integrated into any of the services, particularly nitrogen removal through denitrification. We investigated the composition and denitrification potential of oyster microbiomes with an approach that combined 16S rRNA gene analysis, metabolic inference, qPCR of the nitrous oxide reductase gene (nosZ), and N2 flux measurements. Microbiomes of the oyster digestive gland, the oyster shell, and sediments adjacent to the oyster reef were examined based on next generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Denitrification potentials of the microbiomes were determined by metabolic inferences using a customized denitrification gene and genome database with the paprica (PAthway PRediction by phylogenetIC plAcement) bioinformatics pipeline. Denitrification genes examined included nitrite reductase (nirS and nirK) and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), which was further subdivided by genotype into clade I (nosZI) or clade II (nosZII). Continuous flow through experiments measuring N2 fluxes were conducted with the oysters, shells, and sediments to compare denitrification activities. Paprica properly classified the composition of microbiomes, showing similar classification results from Silva, Greengenes and RDP databases. Microbiomes of the oyster digestive glands and shells were quite different from each other and from the sediments. The relative abundance of denitrifying bacteria inferred by paprica was higher in oysters and shells than in sediments suggesting that oysters act as hotspots for denitrification in the marine environment. Similarly, the inferred nosZI gene abundances were also higher in the oyster and shell microbiomes than in the sediment microbiome. Gene abundances for nosZI were verified with qPCR of nosZI genes, which showed a significant positive correlation (F1,7 = 14.7, p = 6.0x10-3, R2 = 0.68). N2 flux rates were significantly higher in the oyster (364.4 ± 23.5 μmol N-N2 m-2 h-1) and oyster shell (355.3 ± 6.4 μmol N-N2 m-2 h-1) compared to the sediment (270.5 ± 20.1 μmol N-N2 m-2 h-1). Thus, bacteria carrying nosZI genes were found to be an important denitrifier, facilitating nitrogen removal in oyster reefs. In addition, this is the first study to validate the use of 16S gene based metabolic inference as a method for determining microbiome function, such as denitrification, by comparing inference results with qPCR gene quantification and rate measurements.

T1  - Experimental moose reduction lowers wolf density and stops decline of endangered caribou
AN  - 1952363823
AB  - The expansion of moose into southern British Columbia caused the decline and extirpation of woodland caribou due to their shared predators, a process commonly referred to as apparent competition. Using an adaptive management experiment, we tested the hypothesis that reducing moose to historic levels would reduce apparent competition and therefor recover caribou populations. Nested within this broad hypothesis were three specific hypotheses: (1) sport hunting could be used to substantially reduce moose numbers to an ecological target; (2) wolves in this ecosystem were primarily limited by moose abundance; and (3) caribou were limited by wolf predation. These hypotheses were evaluated with a before-after control-impact (BACI) design that included response metrics such as population trends and vital rates of caribou, moose, and wolves. Three caribou subpopulations were subject to the moose reduction treatment and two were in a reference area where moose were not reduced. When the moose harvest was increased, the moose population declined substantially in the treatment area (by 70%) but not the reference area, suggesting that the policy had the desired effect and was not caused by a broader climatic process. Wolf numbers subsequently declined in the treatment area, with wolf dispersal rates 2.5× greater, meaning that dispersal was the likely mechanism behind the wolf numerical response, though reduced recruitment and starvation was also documented in the treatment area. Caribou adult survival increased from 0.78 to 0.88 in the treatment area, but declined in the reference. Caribou recruitment was unaffected by the treatment. The largest caribou subpopulation stabilized in the treatment area, but declined in the reference area. The observed population stability is comparable to other studies that used intensive wolf control, but is insufficient to achieve recovery, suggesting that multiple limiting factors and corresponding management tools must be addressed simultaneously to achieve population growth.

T1  - Invasive Species Awareness: CONSERVATION
AN  - 1922281984
AB  - Someone gets the fish as a pet and rather than disposing of it the right way, they either take the kids out to release it into a lake or flush it down the toilet.

The threat of the Northern Snakehead is a very serious threat because these fish are voracious predators that can live out of water for long periods of time and could wipe out our sport fish populations.

When introduced into the wild, they prey on native fish, compete for food, impact habitat through their spawning events, and can cause disturbance and water turbidity.

How do I apply for the draw or get a Saskatchewan resident hunting licence?

[...]you obtain a Saskatchewan Health Card, you cannot get a license on the online HAL system.

If this happens the fishing event is over and the rod should be put down with the line in until the butterfly or grasshopper is gone and junior is ready to fish again.

[...]next week...keep your rod tip up!

T1  - Assessing the impact of Benzo[a]pyrene on Marine Mussels: Application of a novel targeted low density microarray complementing classical biomarker responses
AN  - 1913783639
AB  - Despite the increasing use of mussels in environmental monitoring and ecotoxicological studies, their genomes and gene functions have not been thoroughly explored. Several cDNA microarrays were recently proposed for Mytilus spp., but putatively identified partial transcripts have rendered the generation of robust transcriptional responses difficult in terms of pathway identification. We developed a new low density oligonucleotide microarray with 465 probes covering the same number of genes. Target genes were selected to cover most of the well-known biological processes in the stress response documented over the last decade in bivalve species at the cellular and tissue levels. Our new ‘STressREsponse Microarray’ (STREM) platform consists of eight sub-arrays with three replicates for each target in each sub-array. To assess the potential use of the new array, we tested the effect of the ubiquitous environmental pollutant benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) at 5, 50, and 100 μg/L on two target tissues, the gills and digestive gland, of Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed invivo for three days. Bioaccumulation of B[a]P was also determined demonstrating exposure in both tissues. In addition to the well-known effects of B[a]P on DNA metabolism and oxidative stress, the new array data provided clues about the implication of other biological processes, such as cytoskeleton, immune response, adhesion to substrate, and mitochondrial activities. Transcriptional data were confirmed using qRT-PCR. We further investigated cellular functions and possible alterations related to biological processes highlighted by the microarray data using oxidative stress biomarkers (Lipofuscin content) and the assessment of genotoxicity. DNA damage, as measured by the alkaline comet assay, increased as a function of dose.DNA adducts measurements using 32P-postlabeling method also showed the presence of bulky DNA adducts (i.e. dG-N2-BPDE). Lipofiscin content increased significantly in B[a]P exposed mussels. Immunohistochemical analysis of tubulin and actin showed changes in cytoskeleton organisation. Our results adopting an integrated approach confirmed that the combination of newly developed transcriptomic approcah, classical biomarkers along with chemical analysis of water and tissue samples should be considered for environmental bioimonitoring and ecotoxicological studies to obtain holistic information to assess the impact of contaminants on the biota.

T1  - Seasonally distinct taxonomic and functional shifts in macroinvertebrate communities following dam removal
AN  - 1953314052
AB  - Dam removal is an increasingly popular restoration tool, but our understanding of ecological responses to dam removal over time is still in the early stages. We quantified seasonal benthic macroinvertebrate density, taxonomic composition, and functional traits for three years after lowhead dam removal in three reaches of the Olentangy River (Ohio, USA): two upstream of former dam (one restored, one unrestored), and one downstream of former dam. Macroinvertebrate community density, generic richness, and Shannon–Wiener diversity decreased between ∼9 and ∼15 months after dam removal; all three variables consistently increased thereafter. These threshold responses were dependent on reach location: density and richness increased ∼15 months after removal in upstream reaches versus ∼19 months downstream of the former dam. Initial macroinvertebrate density declines were likely related to seasonality or life-history characteristics, but density increased up to 2.27× from year to year in three out of four seasons (late autumn, early spring, summer) across all reaches. Macroinvertebrate community composition was similar among the three reaches, but differed seasonally based on non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). Seasonal differences among communities tended to decrease after dam removal. We detected community-wide shifts in functional traits such as multivoltinism, depositional habitat use, burrowing, and collector-gatherer feeding mode. We observed that these traits were expressed most strongly with Chironomidae, which was the most abundant family. Our results suggest that seasonal environmental conditions can play a role in the response and recovery of macroinvertebrate communities—often used to monitor ecosystem condition—following dam removal. In particular, macroinvertebrate density and diversity can show recovery after dam removal, especially in seasons when macroinvertebrate density is typically lowest, with concomitant changes to functional trait abundance. Thus, we recommend scientists and managers consider responses to dam removal throughout the year. Further, similar density, generic richness, and functional traits among reaches suggest that channel restoration after dam removal may initially have equivocal effects on invertebrate communities.

T1  - The effects of environment on Arctica islandica shell formation and architecture
AN  - 1881095247
AB  - Mollusks record valuable information in their hard parts that reflect ambient environmental conditions. For this reason, shells can serve as excellent archives to reconstruct past climate and environmental variability. However, animal physiology and biomineralization, which are often poorly understood, can make the decoding of environmental signals a challenging task. Many of the routinely used shell-based proxies are sensitive to multiple different environmental and physiological variables. Therefore, the identification and interpretation of individual environmental signals (e.g., water temperature) often is particularly difficult. Additional proxies not influenced by multiple environmental variables or animal physiology would be a great asset in the field of paleoclimatology. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential use of structural properties of Arctica islandica shells as an environmental proxy. A total of 11 specimens were analyzed to study if changes of the microstructural organization of this marine bivalve are related to environmental conditions. In order to limit the interference of multiple parameters, the samples were cultured under controlled conditions. Three specimens presented here were grown at two different water temperatures (10 and 15°C) for multiple weeks and exposed only to ambient food conditions. An additional eight specimens were reared under three different dietary regimes. Shell material was analyzed with two techniques; (1) confocal Raman microscopy (CRM) was used to quantify changes of the orientation of microstructural units and pigment distribution, and (2) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to detect changes in microstructural organization. Our results indicate that A. islandica microstructure is not sensitive to changes in the food source and, likely, shell pigment are not altered by diet. However, seawater temperature had a statistically significant effect on the orientation of the biomineral. Although additional work is required, the results presented here suggest that the crystallographic orientation of biomineral units of A. islandica may serve as an alternative and independent proxy for seawater temperature.

T1  - Use of fish species from different trophic levels to control algae and water quality: An enclosure experiment in eutrophic area of Xiaojiang River
AN  - 1875378377
AB  - The effects of stocking both filter-feeding fish and piscivorous fish were compared to the effects of stocking only filter-feeding fish for suppressing algal blooms and improving water quality in the impoundment area of Xiaojiang River where catfish were dominant. Using only filter-feeding fish for algal suppression and water quality control was more effective in the short-term, but use of both filter-feeding fish and piscivorous fish was better in the long-term. Obvious suppression of phytoplankton biomass (PB) only occurred during the first 14 days regardless of the fish stocked. Adding fish to the enclosure clearly alters phytoplankton community structure and introducing piscivorous fish to an enclosure stocked with filter-feeding fish changed the relative densities of dominant algae species. While stocking filter-feeding fish decreased total nitrogen concentration by removing phytoplankton, it did not effectively decrease total phosphorus and Chlorophyll a concentrations. Introducing piscivorous fish to the enclosure weakened the relationship between nutrients and phytoplankton. Results indicate that stocking only filter-feeding fish to improve water quality and suppress phytoplankton in an impoundment area is insufficient and other technologies and means should be applied simultaneously.

T1  - Effects of food resources on the fatty acid composition, growth and survival of freshwater mussels
AN  - 1875113867
AB  - Increased nutrient and sediment loading in rivers have caused observable changes in algal community composition, and thereby, altered the quality and quantity of food resources available to native freshwater mussels. Our objective was to characterize the relationship between nutrient conditions and mussel food quality and examine the effects on fatty acid composition, growth and survival of juvenile mussels. Juvenile Lampsilis cardium and L. siliquoidea were deployed in cages for 28 d at four riverine and four lacustrine sites in the lower St. Croix River, Minnesota/Wisconsin, USA. Mussel foot tissue and food resources (four seston fractions and surficial sediment) were analyzed for quantitative fatty acid (FA) composition. Green algae were abundant in riverine sites, whereas cyanobacteria were most abundant in the lacustrine sites. Mussel survival was high (95%) for both species. Lampsilis cardium exhibited lower growth relative to L. siliquoidea (p <0.0001), but growth of L. cardium was not significantly different across sites (p = 0.13). In contrast, growth of L. siliquoidea was significantly greater at the most upstream riverine site compared to the lower three lacustrine sites (p = 0.002). In situ growth of Lampsilis siliquoidea was positively related to volatile solids (10 – 32 μm fraction), total phosphorus (<10 and 10 – 32 μm fractions), and select FA in the seston (docosapentaeonic acid, DPA, 22:5n3; 4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic, 22:5n6; arachidonic acid, ARA, 20:4n6; and 24:0 in the <10 and 10 – 32 μm fractions). Our laboratory feeding experiment also indicated high accumulation ratios for 22:5n3, 22:5n6, and 20:4n6 in mussel tissue relative to supplied algal diet. In contrast, growth of L. siliquiodea was negatively related to nearly all FAs in the largest size fraction (i.e., >63 μm) of seston, including the bacterial FAs, and several of the FAs associated with sediments. Reduced mussel growth was observed in L. siliquoidea when the abundance of cyanobacteria exceeded 9% of the total phytoplankton biovolume. Areas dominated by cyanobacteria may not provide sufficient food quality to promote or sustain mussel growth.

T1  - Microcystis Rising: Why Phosphorus Reduction Isn't Enough to Stop CyanoHABs
AN  - 1863565778
AB  - Human-generated phosphorus loads do fuel HABs in Lake Erie and elsewhere, but researchers now understand that an excess of another nutrient, nitrogen, shifts the balance in favor of Microcystis rather than other HAB-forming cyanobacteria, diatoms, or green algae.  Multiple scientists and farmers interviewed for this story indicate that the task of managing non-point source pollution is complicated, because many landowners resent government prescriptions as to how they manage their farms--particularly if they are required to take cropland out of production to create vegetated buffer zones or restore wetlands.

T1  - Enhanced Content Bio-Imaging Tools: Realising the Potential for High-Throughput Zebrafish Bioassays
AN  - 2838333942
AB  - Estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EEDCs) are environmental contaminants that can alter hormone signalling in both humans and wildlife, exerting their action through estrogen receptors (ERs). A wealth of evidence has indicated that EEDCs are capable of producing a broad range of adverse outcomes by interacting with, and disrupting, the normal functioning of the estrogen system. Fish are particularly vulnerable to endocrine disruption due to EEDCs being frequently discharged into waterways. With more than 900 chemicals identified as being endocrine disruptors, of which ~200 may exert estrogenic effects, there is an urgent need for screening processes that can assess the estrogenic potential of chemicals in order to avoid human and environmental health risks. In vivo models capable of demonstrating the physiological effects of EEDCs hold great utility for understanding the potential health impacts of estrogens, and transgenic (TG) zebrafish (Danio rerio) models are particularly well-suited for the screening of EEDCs via bioimaging approaches. The pigment-free estrogen-responsive ERE:GFP:Casper model represents a promising transgenic line for qualifying and quantifying EEDC-induced fluorescence responses in larval fish and is amenable to high-throughput screening (HTS). We optimised a medium-throughput semi-automated in vivo bioimaging assay using the model, while simultaneously generating important data concerning estrogen-driven responses to an EEDC (EE2). Through refinement of assay parameters, including the use of various image-masking and pixel-thresholding approaches, controlled-breeding to reduce genetic variability and standardised larval orientation for image acquisition, we established the most sensitive and robust approaches for screening of the EE2-exposed model using a semi-automated imaging modality. Our optimised assay was capable of detecting a significant GFP response in 4 day old zebrafish larvae at an environmentally relevant (5ng/L) concentration of EE2. These specifications were then adopted for investigating the influence of varying incubation temperatures (24, 28 and 32°C) on EE2-exposed ERE:GFP:Casper larval growth and GFP responses. This analysis provided information concerning the potential for an EEDC to interact with temperature in a fish model, with important implications for subsequent interpretation of results. We screened the same animal over a series of timepoints generating valuable data concerning estrogen-induced fluorescence responses and specific larval growth. Incubation temperature was found to have a significant effect on GFP induction, both alone and in interaction with EE2. The findings of this thesis help to outline an improved approach for further development of higher-throughput in vivo estrogenic screening of a transgenic zebrafish model.

T1  - Immunotoxic Impact of Pharmaceuticals on Harbor Seal (Phoca vitulina) Leukocytes
AN  - 2812056192
AB  - La contamination anthropogénique des régions côtières et estuaires a des conséquences pour la santé de l’écosystème. L'exposition des organismes de niveau trophique aux contaminants historiques a été corrélé à des défauts de reproduction, à l’apparition de cancer, et à la favorisation de maladies infectieuses qui peuvent conduire parfois à des évènements de mortalité de masse. Les principes actifs pharmaceutiques représentent une catégorie de contaminants d’intérêt croissant du fait de leur petite taille, de leur habileté à traverser les membranes, et de leur capacité à interagir avec les systèmes biologiques. L’étude de l’effet potentiel de leur combinaison entre eux ou à d’autres familles de composés en milieu aquatique en n'est qu'à ses premiers balbutiements.Mon travail de thèse se décompose en trois études ayant pour but l’évaluation de l’effet que des composés pharmaceutiques, seuls ou en combinaison, peuvent avoir sur le système immunitaire adaptatif des phoques communs (Phoca vitulina). Un ensemble de biomarqueurs a été utilisé pour évaluer la toxicité aigüe des principes actifs pharmaceutiques au niveau cellulaire ainsi que plus finement au niveau de l’expression de certains gènes. L’objectif principal était d’établir des courbes dose-réponse, ainsi que de déterminer la toxicité (IC50) pour les composés sélectionnés.La première étude consistait à évaluer de l’immunotoxicité de composés pharmaceutiques sur une lignée cellulaire dérivée d’un lymphome à cellules B de phoque commun. Des biomarqueurs comme la prolifération lymphoblastique, le cycle cellulaire et l’apoptose, ainsi que la viabilité ont été utilisés pour mesurer le niveau de toxicité de composés pharmaceutiques, seuls ou en combinaison. La prolifération lymphoblastique ainsi que le cycle cellulaire ont été affectés lors de l’utilisation de certains composés. Par ailleurs, les tests (à l'exception de celui de viabilité) ont révélé des effets synergiques lors du traitement avec des combinaisons de composés.La deuxième étude consistait à évaluer de l’immunotoxicité de composés pharmaceutiques sur des cultures primaires de lymphocytes T de chiots de phoques communs en liberté. Dans cette étude, la prolifération lymphocytaire a été inhibée alors que la viabilité est demeurée globalement inchangée lors de traitements avec les composés, seuls ou en combinaison. Les effets des combinaisons de composés n'ont pas été additifs. Les lymphocytes T étaient plus sensibles aux composés individuels que la lignée cellulaire dérivée d’un lymphome à cellules B, mais moins sensibles aux combinaisons.Lors de la troisième étude, nous voulu vérifier si le composé pharmaceutique le plus toxique lors des études précédentes (17α-ethinyl estradiol, EE2), à des concentrations inférieures, était capable d’interférer avec l’expression de certains gènes, dans le but d’identifier plus précisément les mécanismes de toxicité. Nous avons observé une toxicité sur la lignée cellulaire dérivée d’un lymphome à cellules B associée a une augmentation importante de l’expression de l’ARNm de la protéine de choc thermique de 70 kDa uniquement pour les concentrations entrainant des effets sur la prolifération et le cycle cellulaire.Dans son ensemble, ce travail a suggéré que le système immunitaire du phoque commun pouvait être affecté par l’exposition à des composés pharmaceutiques présents dans l’environnement, cependant à des concentrations supérieures à celles mesurées actuellement.Alternate abstract:Anthropogenic contamination of coastal regions and estuaries has consequences for the ecosystem’s health. Exposure to legacy contaminants in organisms of higher trophic levels has been linked to an impairment of reproduction, occurrence of cancer, and an increase in infectious diseases that even led to mass mortality events. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are a contaminant class of emerging interest, since the molecules are rather small, penetrate membranes easily and were designed to interact with a biological system. Their potential effect in the cocktail of substances in the aquatic environment just begun to be discovered.During the course of this dissertation work, three studies were implemented to elucidate the effect that pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical mixtures can have on the adaptive immune system of harbor seals (Phoca vitulina). A battery of biomarkers was used to assess the acute toxicity of APIs on the cellular as well as the gene expression level. The main objective was to determine dose-response curves and IC50 values for the selected compound list.In a first study, immunotoxicity of pharmaceuticals on a harbor seal B cell lymphoma cell line was assessed. Biomarkers like lymphocyte proliferation, cell cycle and apoptotic events as well as viability were used to determine the range of toxicity of individual pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical mixtures. Both lymphocyte proliferation and the cell cycle were impacted by some of the individual compounds, and mixtures demonstrated synergistic effects in all assays, but the viability assay.In a second study, the immunotoxic effect of pharmaceuticals on T lymphocytes of free-ranging harbor seal pups was determined. Lymphocyte proliferation was inhibited while viability remained mainly unaffected for all individual compounds and mixtures tested. Mixtures had non-additive mixed effects. T lymphocytes were more sensitive to individual compounds than the B cell lymphoma cell line, but less sensitive to binary mixtures of pharmaceuticals than the cell line.In a third study, we wanted to assess if the most toxic pharmaceutical compound in our study (17α-ethinyl estradiol, EE2) would present toxic effects at lower concentrations at the gene expression level compared to the cellular level that was tested in previous studies, and furthermore discover potential mechanisms of action of the toxic response. We observed a toxicity towards the harbor seal B lymphoma cell line with a strong increase of the 70 kDa heat shock protein mRNA in those concentrations only that caused effects at the cellular level (i.e. lymphocyte proliferation and cell cycle changes).Overall this work suggests that the immune system of harbor seals can be affected by an exposure to pharmaceutical compounds, however at higher concentrations than currently found in the environment.

T1  - The purplish bifurcate mussel Mytilisepta virgata gene expression atlas reveals a remarkable tissue functional specialization
AN  - 2348351866
AB  - Background 
Mytilisepta virgata is a marine mussel commonly found along the coasts of Japan. Although this species has been the subject of occasional studies concerning its ecological role, growth and reproduction, it has been so far almost completely neglected from a genetic and molecular point of view. In the present study we present a high quality de novo assembled transcriptome of the Japanese purplish mussel, which represents the first publicly available collection of expressed sequences for this species.
 Results 
The assembled transcriptome comprises almost 50,000 contigs, with a N50 statistics of ~1 kilobase and a high estimated completeness based on the rate of BUSCOs identified, standing as one of the most exhaustive sequence resources available for mytiloid bivalves to date. Overall this data, accompanied by gene expression profiles from gills, digestive gland, mantle rim, foot and posterior adductor muscle, presents an accurate snapshot of the great functional specialization of these five tissues in adult mussels.
 Conclusions 
We highlight that one of the most striking features of the M. virgata transcriptome is the high abundance and diversification of lectin-like transcripts, which pertain to different gene families and appear to be expressed in particular in the digestive gland and in the gills. Therefore, these two tissues might be selected as preferential targets for the isolation of molecules with interesting carbohydrate-binding properties.
In addition, by molecular phylogenomics, we provide solid evidence in support of the classification of M. virgata within the Brachidontinae subfamily. This result is in agreement with the previously proposed hypothesis that the morphological features traditionally used to group Mytilisepta spp. and Septifer spp. within the same clade are inappropriate due to homoplasy.

T1  - Chitons (Mollusca, Polyplacophora) from Alacranes Reef, Yucatan, Mexico
AN  - 2170262710
AB  - This study represents the first comprehensive chiton study from Alacranes Reef, the largest reef system in the Gulf of Mexico. Nine chiton species were found in seven localities within the area, in the intertidal and subtidal to 12 m depth. SEM examination of  C. janeirensis ,  A. hemphilli ,  T. schrammi  and  C. floridanus , showed variations in the sculpture and radular teeth morphology when compared to specimens of the same species from Florida Keys, Bahamas and Puerto Rico. The distribution ranges of  T. schrammi ,  L. liozonis  and  S. floridana  are extended into the south-western area of the Gulf of Mexico. Altogether, combining previous literature and the present survey, reports eleven chiton species which have now been recorded within the Alacranes reef area.

T1  - Environmental variables driving the larval distribution of Limnoperna fortunei in the upper Paraná River floodplain, Brazil
TT  - Variáveis ambientais que direcionam a distribuiçâo larval de Limnoperna fortunei na planicie de inundaçao do alto rio Paraná, Brasil
AN  - 2110240952
AB  - Aim: To verify the temporal dynamics of Limnoperna fortunei larval stages and to identify the main environmental variables driving the larval density patterns in an area highly impacted by reservoirs. Methods: Samplings were performed quarterly, from February to December 2014, in 10 transects along to the Paraná River main channel. For each sample site, 100 L of water were filtered. The filtrated was fixed in alcohol 80%, and the larval stages were counted and classified under the optical microscope. Concomitant to biological collections we took some of the main water variables. We performed a Redundancy Analysis (RDA) in order to summarize the variations in densities of larval stages in relation to the main physical and chemical water variables. Results: We found a total of200,590 L. fortunei larvae, in which 83.6% were identified as the initial stages. The most abundant months in L. fortunei larvae were December and February. The first two axes of RDA sum up 96% of the total data variation, and the most significant environmental variables explaining variations in larval densities were: water temperature, total nitrogen, electrical conductivity, phosphate, dissolved oxygen, depth and ammoniac ion. The warmer months were influenced by the major values of water temperature and depth, besides the higher densities of all larval stages. Conclusions: Our results indicate that L. fortunei reproduction follows a general pattern throughout the upper Paraná River floodplain, what seems to occur mainly between February and December. Thus, we suggest that measures for the L. fortunei control should be done during low-density periods (i.e., April to August), when the water level is low, and consequently, the dispersion of this species might be limited.Alternate abstract:Objetivo: Verificar a dinámica temporal dos estágios larvais de Limnoperna fortunei, e identificar as variáveis ambientais direcionadoras desses padröes, em uma área altamente impactada pela construçâo de reservatórios. Métodos: As amostragens foram realizadas trimestralmente, de fevereiro a dezembro de 2014, em 10 transectos ao longo do canal principal do rio Paraná. Para cada local de amostragem, foram filtrados 100 L de água. O filtrado foi fixado em álcool 80%, e os estágios larvais foram contados e identificados sob microscopio óptico. Concomitantemente as coletas biológicas, avaliamos as principais variáveis limnológicas nos pontos de amostragem. Realizamos uma ordenaçâo pela Análise de Redundancia (RDA), para sumarizar a variaçâo das densidades dos estágios larvais em relaçâo as principais variáveis físicas e químicas da água. Resultados: Encontramos um total de 200.590 larvas de L. fortunei, do qual 83,6% foram identificados como estágios iniciais. As densidades mais elevadas de larvas de L. fotunei foram os meses de dezembro e fevereiro. Os dois primeiros eixos da RDA sumarizaram 96% da variaçâo total dos dados, e as variáveis ambientais significativas para explicar as variaçöes nas densidades larvais foram: temperatura da água, nitrogenio total, condutividade elétrica, fosfato, oxigenio dissolvido, profundidade, e íon amonio. Os meses quentes foram influenciados pela temperatura e profundidade, juntamente com as maiores densidades dos estágios larvais. Conclusoes: Nossos resultados indicam que a reproduçâo segue um padrâo geral ao longo de toda a planície, acontecendo principalmente nos meses de fevereiro e dezembro. Assim, sugerimos que medidas de controle de L. fortunei devem ser tomadas nos períodos de baixas densidades (junho e agosto), quando o nivel da água está baixo, e consequentemente, sua dispersâo está limitada.

T1  - Microbial Diseases of Bivalve Mollusks: Infections, Immunology and Antimicrobial Defense
AN  - 2108554956
AB  - A variety of bivalve mollusks (phylum Mollusca, class Bivalvia) constitute a prominent commodity in fisheries and aquacultures, but are also crucial in order to preserve our ecosystem’s complexity and function. Bivalve mollusks, such as clams, mussels, oysters and scallops, are relevant bred species, and their global farming maintains a high incremental annual growth rate, representing a considerable proportion of the overall fishery activities. Bivalve mollusks are filter feeders; therefore by filtering a great quantity of water, they may bioaccumulate in their tissues a high number of microorganisms that can be considered infectious for humans and higher vertebrates. Moreover, since some pathogens are also able to infect bivalve mollusks, they are a threat for the entire mollusk farming industry. In consideration of the leading role in aquaculture and the growing financial importance of bivalve farming, much interest has been recently devoted to investigate the pathogenesis of infectious diseases of these mollusks in order to be prepared for public health emergencies and to avoid dreadful income losses. Several bacterial and viral pathogens will be described herein. Despite the minor complexity of the organization of the immune system of bivalves, compared to mammalian immune systems, a precise description of the different mechanisms that induce its activation and functioning is still missing. In the present review, a substantial consideration will be devoted in outlining the immune responses of bivalves and their repertoire of immune cells. Finally, we will focus on the description of antimicrobial peptides that have been identified and characterized in bivalve mollusks. Their structural and antimicrobial features are also of great interest for the biotechnology sector as antimicrobial templates to combat the increasing antibiotic-resistance of different pathogenic bacteria that plague the human population all over the world.

T1  - The experimental set for in situ research of benthic communities in marine and freshwater ecosystems
AN  - 2056756258
AB  - The presented system of experimental trays permits conducting field experiments at considerable depths, all year round, and with no application of diving techniques. The deployed set can be entirely hidden under water, which is an advantage in crowded areas. The set is composed of single units, each composed of a tray filled with a substrate, four-legged bridles, and a hanging rope with a removable marker float fixed on top by means of a carabiner clip. The float provides information on the location of deployed trays, and permits proper distribution of next trays to be deployed. After deployment from a boat, the units are connected with a rope, extended on one end by a sinking retrieval rope. The floats are removed immediately after deployment. Any number of units can be deployed to the bottom. It depends on the experimental design and the number of replicates. Retrieval of the set starts with locating the trays by means of GPS, and searching for the retrieval rope by means of a grappling hook dragged behind the boat. Based on our own experience and the literature, the possibilities of development of the described system are proposed depending on the local field conditions and research objectives.
Le dispositif de plate-forme expérimentale présenté permet de réaliser des expériences de terrain à des profondeurs considérables, toute l'année, et sans besoin de techniques de plongée. L'ensemble déployé peut être entièrement caché sous l'eau, ce qui est un avantage dans les zones fréquentées. L'ensemble est composé d'unités simples, chacune composée d'un plateau rempli d'un substrat, avec une corde à chaque coin avec boucle, et d'une corde de suspension avec un flotteur marqueur amovible fixé au moyen d'un mousqueton. Le flotteur fournit des informations sur l'emplacement des plateaux déployés et permet une distribution correcte des plateaux successifs à déployer. Après le déploiement depuis un bateau, les unités sont reliées par une corde, prolongée à une extrémité par une corde de récupération lestée. Les flotteurs sont retirés immédiatement après le déploiement. Un nombre quelconque d'unités peut être déployé sur le fond. Cela dépend de la conception expérimentale et du nombre de répétitions. La récupération de l'ensemble commence par la localisation des plateaux au moyen du GPS et la recherche de la corde de récupération au moyen d'un crochet traîné derrière le bateau. Sur la base de notre propre expérience et de la littérature, les possibilités de développement du système décrit sont proposées en fonction des conditions locales de terrain et des objectifs de recherche.

T1  - Escape Burrowing of Modern Freshwater Bivalves as a Paradigm for Escape Behavior in the Devonian Bivalve Archanodon catskillensis
AN  - 1988722759
AB  - Many freshwater bivalves restore themselves to the sediment water interface after burial by upward escape burrowing. We studied the escape burrowing capacity of two modern unionoids, Elliptio complanata and Pyganodon cataracta and the invasive freshwater venerid Corbicula fluminea, in a controlled laboratory setting varying sediment grain size and burial depth. We found that the relatively streamlined E. complanata is a better escape burrower than the more obese P. cataracta. E. complanata is more likely to escape burial in both fine and coarse sand, and at faster rates than P. cataracta. However, successful escape from 10 cm burial, especially in fine sand, is unlikely for both unionoids. The comparatively small and obese C. fluminea outperforms both unionoids in terms of escape probability and escape time, especially when body size is taken into consideration. C. fluminea can escape burial depths many times its own size, while the two unionoids rarely escape from burial equivalent to the length of their shells. E. complanata, and particularly P. cataracta, are morphological paradigms for the extinct Devonian unionoid bivalve Archanodon catskillensis, common in riverine facies of the Devonian Catskill Delta Complex of the eastern United States. Our observations suggest that the escape burrowing capability of A. catskillensis was no better than that of P. cataracta. Archanodon catskillensis was likely unable to escape burial of more than a few centimeters of anastrophically deposited sediment. The long (up to 1 meter), vertical burrows that are associated with A. catskillensis, and interpreted to be its escape burrows, represent a response to episodic, small-scale sedimentation events due to patterns of repetitive hydrologic or weather-related phenomena. They are not a response to a single anastrophic event involving the influx of massive volumes of sediment.

T1  - Development and Validation of an On-Line Water Toxicity Sensor with Immobilized Luminescent Bacteria for On-Line Surface Water Monitoring
AN  - 1977872553
AB  - Surface water used for drinking water production is frequently monitored in The Netherlands using whole organism biomonitors, with for example Daphnia magna or Dreissena mussels, which respond to changes in the water quality. However, not all human-relevant toxic compounds can be detected by these biomonitors. Therefore, a new on-line biosensor has been developed, containing immobilized genetically modified bacteria, which respond to genotoxicity in the water by emitting luminescence. The performance of this sensor was tested under laboratory conditions, as well as under field conditions at a monitoring station along the river Meuse in The Netherlands. The sensor was robust and easy to clean, with inert materials, temperature control and nutrient feed for the reporter organisms. The bacteria were immobilized in sol-gel on either an optical fiber or a glass slide and then continuously exposed to water. Since the glass slide was more sensitive and robust, only this setup was used in the field. The sensor responded to spikes of genotoxic compounds in the water with a minimal detectable concentration of 0.01 mg/L mitomycin C in the laboratory and 0.1 mg/L mitomycin C in the field. With further optimization, which should include a reduction in daily maintenance, the sensor has the potential to become a useful addition to the currently available biomonitors.

T1  - Petroleum Performances
AN  - 1947710098
AB  - This dissertation is a study of petroleum performances. It is a creative, performative, and speculative analysis of industrial petroleum operations, rhetorics about petroleum, and everyday North American life capacitated by petroleum products. North American petroleum operations and relations are examined through comparison and substitution with indigenous legal thought. This dissertation, in two parts, focuses on two technical operations of the petroleum industry, a refinery and a pipeline hub.    Part One: Refining Petroleum Performances is about petroleum performances analyzed and speculated through the refining processes of the BP Cherry Point Refinery located at Xwe'chi'eXen. These chapters explore petroleum performances through analogy, parable and allegory figured by thinking with indigenous jurisprudence and ecological figuration. The analysis and speculations are arranged around a technical description of refinery processes from incoming crude to finished fuels. Nested and nestled within the refinery performance, its form analogizes to refine a taxonomy of petroleum performances; combustion, petroleum relations, motive power, works and rhetoric about petroleum, petroleum infrastructure and backgrounds, petroleum jurisprudence, and petroleum allegories. The technical description diagrams a parable of petroleum performance saturated with examples from art, industry, and the everyday.    Part two of Petroleum Performances, Pipelining Spacetime, examines how pipelines perform petroleum spacetime. It demonstrates how petroleum and petroleum rhetoric perform and reinforce grand narratives and teleological futures. This petroleum space/time continuum is contrasted with periodic and place-based temporalities of some indigenous jurisdictions. Pipeline Spacetime investigates Patoka terminal, a place full of pipelines through experiences of times and places that refuses pipelines.

T1  - Generating Genomic Resources for Two Crustacean Species and their Application to the Study of White Spot Disease
AN  - 1913434597
AB  - Over the last decades the crustacean aquaculture sector has been steadily growing, in order to meet global demands for its products. A major hurdle for further growth of the industry is the prevalence of viral disease epidemics that are facilitated by the intense culture conditions. A devastating virus impacting on the sector is the White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), responsible for over US $ 10 billion in losses in shrimp production and trade. The Pathogenicity of WSSV is high, reaching 100 % mortality within 3-10 days in penaeid shrimps. In contrast, the European shore crab Carcinus maenas has been shown to be relatively resistant to WSSV. Uncovering the basis of this resistance could help inform on the development of strategies to mitigate the WSSV threat. C. maenas has been used widely in studies on ecotoxicology and host-pathogen interactions. However, like most aquatic crustaceans, the genomic resources available for this species are limited, impairing experimentation. Therefore, to facilitate interpretations of the exposure studies, we first produced a C. maenas transcriptome and genome scaffold assembly. We also produced a transcriptome for the European lobster (Homarus gammarus), an ecologically and commercially important crustacean species in United Kingdom waters, for use in comparing WSSV responses in this, a susceptible species, and C. maenas.For the C. maenas transcriptome assembly we isolated and pooled RNA from twelve different tissues and sequenced RNA on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. After de novo assembly a transcriptome encompassing 212,427 transcripts was produced. Similar, the H. gammarus transcriptome was based on RNA from nine tissues and contained 106,498 transcripts. The transcripts were filtered and annotated using a variety of tools (including BLAST, MEGAN and RSEM) and databases (including GenBank, Gene Ontology and KEGG). The annotation rate for transcripts in both transcriptomes was around 20-25 % which appears to be common for aquatic crustacean species, as a result of the lack of well annotated gene sequences for this clade. Since it is likely that the host immune system would play an important role in WSSV infection we characterized the IMD, JAK/STAT, Tolllike receptor and other innate immune system pathways. We found a strong overlap between the immune system pathways in C. maenas and H. gammarus. In addition we investigated the sequence diversity of known WSSV interacting proteins amongst susceptible penaeid shrimp/lobster and the more resistant C. maenas. There were differences in viral receptor sequences, like Rab7, that correlate with a less efficient infection by WSSV.To produce the genome scaffold assembly for C. maenas we isolated DNA from muscle tissue and produced both paired-end and mate pair libraries for processing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. A de novo draft genome assembly consisting of 338,980 scaffolds and covering 362 Mb (36 % of estimated genome size) was produced, using SOAP-denovo2 coupled with the BESST scaffolding system. The generated assembly was highly fragmented due to the presence of repetitive areas in the C. maenas genome.

T1  - Distribution of Herbivorous Fish Is Frozen by Low Temperature
AN  - 1899447025
AB  - The number of herbivores in populations of ectothermic vertebrates decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, fish consuming plant matter are exclusively omnivorous. We assess whether omnivorous fish readily shift to herbivory or whether animal prey is typically preferred. We address temperature as the key factor causing their absence at higher latitudes and discuss the potential poleward dispersion caused by climate changes. A controlled experiment illustrates that rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) readily utilize plant matter at water temperatures above 20 °C and avoid its consumption below 20 °C. Field data support these results, showing that plant matter dominates rudd diets during the summer and is absent during the spring. Utilizing cellulose requires the enzyme cellulase, which is produced by microorganisms growing at temperatures of 15-42 °C. Water temperatures at higher latitudes do not reach 15 °C year-round; at our latitude of 50°N~150 days/year. Hence, the species richness of omnivorous fish decreases dramatically above 55° latitude. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that strict herbivorous specialists have developed only in the tropics. Temperatures below 15 °C, even for a short time period, inactivate cellulase and cause diet limitations for omnivorous fish. However, we may expect increases in herbivory at higher latitudes caused by climate change.

T1  - Screening of 17[alpha]-ethynylestradiol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals accumulation in Mytilus edulis trossulus (Gould, 1890) collected from the Gulf of Gdansk
AN  - 1851003766
AB  - Pharmaceuticals are commonly found in water collected from wastewater treatment plants, fresh water and saline water. Their presence in water may result in constant accumulation in living organisms, and consequently a negative impact on those organisms. Abiotic samples collected from the Gulf of Gdansk were already proven to be polluted by several classes of pharmaceuticals, but the bioaccumulation was not investigated as far. This study presents the first results on the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in [Mytilus edulis trossulus] (Gould 1890) mussels collected from the Gulf of Gdansk. The content of target 6 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, paracetamol, naproxen, ketoprofen) and 17α-ethynylestradiol in water and tissue samples was determined. The selected pharmaceuticals (paracetamol, flurbiprofen, 17α-ethynylestradiol) were found only in the largest individuals. The in situ BAFs calculated for paracetamol and flurbiprofen were 2850 and 16154 l kg[-1] (dry weight), respectively, suggesting a high potential for the bioaccumulation of these compounds. The synthetic hormone 17α-ethynylestradiol was also found in the collected mussels at the concentration of 310 ng g[-1] of dry weight. Generally, the examined mussels showed poor condition and it is highly likely that the accumulated pharmaceuticals are one of the important factors contributing to this.

T1  - How to eliminate invasive species and safeguard summer outdoor activities
AN  - 1805202347
AB  - Unfortunately, your favorite Ontario cottage and camping activities - such as boating, fishing, gardening and outdoor chores - are being seriously hurt by the rise of invasive species. In fact, every year invasive plants cost the agriculture and forest industries in Canada about $7.3 billion. In Ontario, the impacts from zebra mussels alone cost between $75 million and $91 million per year.

              
To keep your lake beautiful and protect the native species that belong there, it's important to be able to identify, prevent the spread of, report and eliminate the invasive species that don't belong.

              
You can report sightings of invasive species by calling the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters' Invading Species Hotline at 1-800-563-7711 or by emailing info@invadingspecies.com. You can also use the EDDMapS Ontario system to report sightings through your computer or smartphone.

T1  - River Science:&nbsp;Research and Management for the 21st Century
AN  - 2130951848
AB  - River Science is a rapidly developing interdisciplinary field at the interface of the natural sciences, engineering and socio-political sciences. It recognises that the sustainable management of contemporary rivers will increasingly require new ways of characterising them to enable engagement with the diverse range of stakeholders.
 
 This volume represents the outcome of research by many of the authors and their colleagues over the last 40 years and demonstrates the integral role that River Science now plays in underpinning our understanding of the functioning of natural ecosystems, and how societal demands and historic changes have affected these systems. The book will inform academics, policy makers and society in general of the benefits of healthy functioning riverine systems, and will increase awareness of the wide range of ecosystem goods and services they provide.

David Gilvear is a Professor of River Science at the University of Plymouth, UK. His river research has been at the hydrology, geomorphology and ecology interface within a geographically-led space-time framework - inspired by his PhD supervisor, Professor Petts. The majority of research has been in response to catchment specific, national or global issues in river management and as such he has worked with industry, environmental bodies and regulatory authorities. 

Malcolm Greenwood is an ecologist, with a special interest in entomology, and is now retired from Loughborough University. He has worked closely with Professor Petts over many years, bringing together the biological principles appropriate to our understanding of contemporary and palaeo river systems, including the changes brought about by river engineering and management practices. 

Martin Thoms is a Professor of River Science at the University of New England, Armidale, Australia. He believes the most exciting research is undertaken at boundaries - the boundaries between different disciplines, the science-management-policy boundary and the boundaries between rivers and their floodplains. His research in this domain has occurred in both national and international settings. 

Paul Wood is Professor of Ecohydrology at Loughborough University, UK. His research encompasses the disciplines of hydrology, ecology, geomorphology and environmental management to address contemporary questions in River Science. His research is centred on environmental flows and the effects of disturbances in surface and groundwater dominated systems.

T1  - Branchiosyllis, Haplosyllis, Opisthosyllis and Trypanosyllis (Annelida: Syllidae) from Brazil, with the Description of Two New Species
AN  - 1798997403
AB  - Brazilian specimens of Branchiosyllis cf. exilis, B. tamandarensis sp. n., Haplosyllis lattigae sp. n., H. loboi, Opisthosyllis brunnea and O. viridis are described and illustrated herein, from recently collected material; also, the distributions of Haplosyllis amphimedonicola and H. rosenalessoae are expanded to other localities in the states of Paraíba and Pernambuco. Branchiosyllis tamandarensis sp. n. was found associated with sponges and is characterized by having a flattened, ribbon-like body, with longitudinal line of mid-dorsal papillae, peristomium dorsally inconspicuous, branchiae with up to six lobes, branchiae and ungulae on all parapodia, and falcigers absent. Haplosyllis lattigae sp. n. is characterized by having two kinds of chaetae with different sizes and shapes per parapodium, papillate dorsum from midbody, and midbody dorsal cirri alternating in length. Additionally, we provide keys to the Brazilian species of Branchiosyllis, Haplosyllis and Opisthosyllis, comparative tables of the new species described herein and selected similar congeners, and the first record for Trypanosyllis zebra in the states of Espírito Santo and Paraíba.

T1  - Male personality and female spawning consistency in a goby with exclusive male care
AN  - 1783659806
AB  - Abstract              Consistent inter-individual behavioral differences in animals, or animal personalities, are increasingly recognized as an important component of sexual selection. Despite growing evidence for personality-mediated effects on reproductive success in species with biparental care, the link between personality and intrasexual competition or mate choice in species with uniparental care remains largely unexplored. Here, the non-caring sex in particular should seek partners with personality traits that promise high quality care. Therefore, we investigated effects of male personality in the common goby, a well-established model species for sexual selection under exclusive male care. Using competitive trials, we investigated how personality affects male ability to monopolize either of two central reproductive resources, nesting sites (male-male competition) and ready-to-spawn females (female choice). Personalities were scored in a feeding context and thus independent of reproduction. We found that slow-feeding individuals better succeeded in monopolizing nests, but that female spawning decisions were independent of the foraging personality of two male competitors. Instead, females showed a remarkably consistent between-female spawning preference for slightly heavier males and males with more elaborate nests. Our findings indicate that fitness benefits of the male personality type only materialize via male-male competition in environments where nesting sites are a limiting resource, whereas female choice favors large males with elaborate nests independent of male personality.              Significance statement              Animal personality can strongly affect reproductive success in species with parental care. We studied this link in the common goby, a fish where males build nests and solely take care of the brood until hatching. Hence, females should choose a male whose personality traits promise high quality care. We scored male personalities and conducted nest-competition and mate-choice trials. We found that male personality had an effect on nest monopolization, but not on female mating preferences. Instead, females agreed remarkably well in their mating decisions and consistently favored large males with elaborate nests. Our results show that male personality is important for nest allocation, which is crucial in environments where nesting sites are rare.

T1  - Dogs and drones battle invasive species; Prevention costs just a fraction of potential damage
AN  - 1762280722
AB  - The inspection stations have conducted about 21,500 boat inspections, of which 11 carried invasive mussels - more than half of them headed for B.C. Invasive mussels are especially challenging because they can survive for about a month out of water, clinging to hard surfaces on boats.    Since invasive mussels were introduced to North America in the late 1980s in ship ballast, they have caused havoc to water infrastructure and native ecosystems, Sawchuk said.

T1  - Predicting Effects of Water Regime Changes on Waterbirds: Insights from Staging Swans
AN  - 1764342605
AB  - Predicting the environmental impact of a proposed development is notoriously difficult, especially when future conditions fall outside the current range of conditions. Individual-based approaches have been developed and applied to predict the impact of environmental changes on wintering and staging coastal bird populations. How many birds make use of staging sites is mostly determined by food availability and accessibility, which in the case of many waterbirds in turn is affected by water level. Many water systems are regulated and water levels are maintained at target levels, set by management authorities. We used an individual-based modelling framework (MORPH) to analyse how different target water levels affect the number of migratory Bewick’s swans Cygnus columbianus bewickii staging at a shallow freshwater lake (Lauwersmeer, the Netherlands) in autumn. As an emerging property of the model, we found strong non-linear responses of swan usage to changes in water level, with a sudden drop in peak numbers as well as bird-days with a 0.20 m rise above the current target water level. Such strong non-linear responses are probably common and should be taken into account in environmental impact assessments.

T1  - A feminist political ecology of indigenous vegetables in a South African protected area community
AN  - 1881315667
AB  - For over 100 years, the communities adjacent to the Dwesa and Cwebe Forests in South Africa have been caught in a conflict over natural resources. Residents were forcibly removed from the area for decades by colonial and apartheid-era governments. After being declared a Nature Reserve in 1978, locals were fenced out, losing all access to natural resources. Although the communities won a land-claim battle in 2001, the current management of the reserve still reflects a “fortress conservation” model, where local people are prohibited from harvesting natural resources, including indigenous vegetables. Remarkably, the knowledge associated with these foods endures, primarily through the stories, actions, and resistance of local women.   Using a feminist political ecology framework to illustrate the gendered power dynamics that mediate the knowledge, valuation, and use of indigenous vegetables, (known locally as imifino), this study describes how women’s everyday practices, traditions, and resistance strategies are being deployed to promote indigenous vegetable (imifino) consumption from both the protected area site as well as in homestead gardens. Analyzing how these local struggles are connected to the wider political discourse on biodiversity conservation sheds light on how formal management rules and regulations interplay with, and are negotiated on a daily basis by protected area community members. Results of the study indicate that a co-management structure that takes women’s knowledge into account could encourage the sustainable use of these resources and consequently, help maintain the indigenous knowledge associated with indigenous vegetables (imifino ).   A mixed methods approach was taken to gather a holistic picture of the knowledge and practices surrounding these indigenous vegetables. A variety of qualitative and visual methods including participant observation, key informant interviews, facilitated group discussions, free-listing of species, forest walks, community history mapping, and participatory photography were chosen to gain in-depth understanding of indigenous knowledge, community challenges, and everyday strategies of adaptation and resistance to current reserve management. A household survey of 80 homesteads in Southern Hobeni Village was used to provide information on the different varieties of imifino grown in homestead gardens (igadi) as well as intra-household data on the gendered labor dynamics for cultivating these varieties.

T1  - Population genetic structure of softshell clams (Mya arenaria) with regard to a saxitoxin-resistant mutation and neutral genetic markers in the Gulf of Maine
AN  - 1847984004
AB  - The softshell clam, Mya arenaria, is a commercially important bivalve species that is found in soft-bottom intertidal habitats throughout the Gulf of Maine, USA. This species is subjected to seasonal blooms of the toxic algae Alexandrium spp., and acts as a vector for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) during harmful algal bloom (HAB) events. Some clams possess a naturally occurring genetic mutation of their voltage-gated sodium channels that grants them a resistance to the paralytic effects of saxitoxin (STX) produced by Alexandrium spp. The mutation allows these individuals to continue feeding during HABs, and greatly increases their tissue toxicity through bioaccumulation. This work describes the distribution of the resistant mutation in wild clam populations in the Gulf of Maine, and explores the population structure of M. arenaria with regard to the mutation, as well as neutral genetic markers. Analysis of neutral markers revealed no significant population structure within the Gulf of Maine, however  M arenaria does exhibit strong localized structure at the STX-resistant mutation locus. This structure is sustained by differential selective pressure exerted by Alexandrium spp. blooms, despite freely occurring gene flow among clam populations. In Penobscot Bay, one area where the prevalence of the resistant mutation did not match the strength of selective pressure, it is likely that the resistant allele is maintained by gene flow through larval transport from other regions, rather than by seeding of hatchery stock carrying the mutation. This work can aid PSP monitoring efforts by identifying areas where risk is greatest to humans due to high numbers of resistant clams. In addition, distinguishing areas where one genotype is clearly favored over the others may be of interest to seeding programs trying to ensure that their stock is well-suited for the location to which they will be transplanted.

T1  - Zebrafish: A Versatile Animal Model for Fertility Research
AN  - 1816880110
AB  - The utilization of zebrafish in biomedical research is very common in the research world nowadays. Today, it has emerged as a favored vertebrate organism for the research in science of reproduction. There is a significant growth in amount numbers of scientific literature pertaining to research discoveries in reproductive sciences in zebrafish. It has implied the importance of zebrafish in this particular field of research. In essence, the current available literature has covered from the very specific brain region or neurons of zebrafish, which are responsible for reproductive regulation, until the gonadal level of the animal. The discoveries and findings have proven that this small animal is sharing a very close/similar reproductive system with mammals. More interestingly, the behavioral characteristics and along with the establishment of animal courtship behavior categorization in zebrafish have laid an even stronger foundation and firmer reason on the suitability of zebrafish utilization in research of reproductive sciences. In view of the immense importance of this small animal for the development of reproductive sciences, this review aimed at compiling and describing the proximate close similarity of reproductive regulation on zebrafish and human along with factors contributing to the infertility, showing its versatility and its potential usage for fertility research.

T1  - Biomonitoring Climate Change and Pollution in Marine Ecosystems: A Review on Aulacomya ater
AN  - 1816601691
AB  - The sedentarism and wide global distribution of the blue mussel Mytilus edulis have made it a useful bioindicator to assess changes in the health status of the marine ecosystem in response to pollution and other environmental stresses. Effective biomonitoring of an ecosystem requires, however, that multiple biomarkers be used to obtain an accurate measure of the cumulative effects of different sources of environmental stress. Here, we provide a first integrated review of the biological, economical, and geographical characteristics of another species of mussels, the ribbed mussel Aulacomya ater. We discuss the use of Aulacomya ater as a complementary biomonitor to the blue mussel to assess the impact of pollutants and climate change. Recent findings have indeed shown that Mytilus edulis and Aulacomya ater have distinctive anatomy and physiology and respond differently to environmental stress. Monitoring of mixed beds containing blue and ribbed mussels may thus represent a unique opportunity to study the effect of environmental stress on the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, most notably in the Southern hemisphere, which is particularly sensitive to climate change and where both species often cohabitate in the same intertidal zones.

T1  - Proteomic Analysis of the Schistosoma mansoni Miracidium
AN  - 1759161524
AB  - Despite extensive control efforts, schistosomiasis continues to be a major public health problem in developing nations in the tropics and sub-tropics. The miracidium, along with the cercaria, both of which are water-borne and free-living, are the only two stages in the life-cycle of Schistosoma mansoni which are involved in host invasion. Miracidia penetrate intermediate host snails and develop into sporocysts, which lead to cercariae that can infect humans. Infection of the snail host by the miracidium represents an ideal point at which to interrupt the parasite’s life-cycle. This research focuses on an analysis of the miracidium proteome, including those proteins that are secreted. We have identified a repertoire of proteins in the S. mansoni miracidium at 2 hours post-hatch, including proteases, venom allergen-like proteins, receptors and HSP70, which might play roles in snail-parasite interplay. Proteins involved in energy production and conservation were prevalent, as were proteins predicted to be associated with defence. This study also provides a strong foundation for further understanding the roles that neurohormones play in host-seeking by schistosomes, with the potential for development of novel anthelmintics that interfere with its various life-cycle stages.

T1  - Assessing the impact of removal scenarios on population viability of a threatened, long-lived avian scavenger
AN  - 1899804876
AB  - The removal of eggs or chicks from wild populations to create captive populations, reinforce free-ranging populations or reintroduce species into the wild is a restoration tool that requires an assessment of potential detrimental effects upon the donor population. This is an absolute prerequisite when wild donor populations are scarce and small. Here, we forecast the population trend of the largest European population of the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) over the next 30 years under different demographic and management scenarios (removal of eggs, chicks or fledglings). Projections derived from the combination of a PDP model (Population Dynamic P-system) and a Box-Behnken design would lead to a decline in 77% of all 57 scenarios analysed. Among the 13 scenarios predicting a population increase, only 4 seem realistic in terms of growth rate (0.04%-1.01%), at least if current age at first breeding and productivity would remain constant over time. Our simulations thus suggest that most extraction scenarios would have detrimental effects on the demography of the donor population. Release of captive-born young or removal of only the second hatched chick for subsequent captive rearing and translocation into the wild appear to represent much better supplementation and reintroduction options in this threatened species.

T1  - Biomonitoring Heavy Metal Pollution Using an Aquatic Apex Predator, the American Alligator, and Its Parasites
AN  - 1732312185
AB  - Monitoring the bioaccumulation of chemical elements within various organismal tissues has become a useful tool to survey current or chronic levels of heavy metal exposure within an environment. In this study, we compared the bioaccumulations of As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb, Se, and Zn between the American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis, and its parasites in order to establish their use as bioindicators of heavy metal pollution. Concomitant with these results, we were interested to determine if parasites were more sensitive bioindicators of heavy metals relative to alligators. We found parasites collectively accumulated higher levels of As, Cu, Se, and Zn in comparison to their alligator hosts, whereas Fe, Cd, and Pb concentrations were higher in alligators. Interestingly, Fe levels were significantly greater in intestinal trematodes than their alligator hosts when analyzed independently from other parasitic taxa. Further analyses showed alligator intestinal trematodes concentrated As, Cu, Fe, Se, and Zn at significantly higher levels than intestinal nematodes and parasites from other organs. However, pentastomids also employed the role as a good biomagnifier of As. Interestingly, parasitic abundance decreased as levels of As increased. Stomach and intestinal nematodes were the poorest bioaccumulators of metals, yet stomach nematodes showed their ability to concentrate Pb at orders of magnitude higher in comparison to other parasites. Conclusively, we suggest that parasites, particularly intestinal trematodes, are superior biomagnifiers of As, Cu, Se, and Zn, whereas alligators are likely good biological indicators of Fe, Cd, and Pb levels within the environment.

T1  - Mussel adhesion is dictated by time-regulated secretion and molecular conformation of mussel adhesive proteins
AN  - 1727649504
AB  - Interfacial water constitutes a formidable barrier to strong surface bonding, hampering the development of water-resistant synthetic adhesives. Notwithstanding this obstacle, the Asian green mussel Perna viridis attaches firmly to underwater surfaces via a proteinaceous secretion (byssus). Extending beyond the currently known design principles of mussel adhesion, here we elucidate the precise time-regulated secretion of P. viridis mussel adhesive proteins. The vanguard 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (Dopa)-rich protein Pvfp-5 acts as an adhesive primer, overcoming repulsive hydration forces by displacing surface-bound water and generating strong surface adhesion. Using homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations, we find that all mussel adhesive proteins are largely unordered, with Pvfp-5 adopting a disordered structure and elongated conformation whereby all Dopa residues reside on the protein surface. Time-regulated secretion and structural disorder of mussel adhesive proteins appear essential for optimizing extended nonspecific surface interactions and byssus' assembly. Our findings reveal molecular-scale principles to help the development of wet-resistant adhesives.

T1  - Handbook of Road Ecology
AN  - 2131989520
AB  - This authoritative volume brings together some of the world's leading researchers, academics, practitioners and transportation agency personnel to present the current status of the ecological sustainability of the linear infrastructure - primarily road, rail and utility easements - that dissect and fragment landscapes globally. It outlines the potential impacts, demonstrates how this infrastructure is being improved, and how broad ecological principles are applied to mitigate the impact of road networks on wildlife.
 
 Research and monitoring is an important aspect of road ecology, encompassing all phases of a transportation project. This book covers research and monitoring to span the entire project continuum - starting with planning and design, through construction and into maintenance and management. It focuses on impacts and solutions for
 species groups and specific regions, with particular emphasis on the unique challenges facing Asia, South America and Africa. 
Other key features: 
 

 Contributions from authors originating from over 25 countries, including from all continents 

 Each chapter summarizes important lessons, and includes lists of further reading and thoroughly up to date references 

 Highlights principles that address key points relevant to all phases in all road projects 

 Explains best-practices based on a number of successful international case studies 

 Chapters are 'stand-alone', but they also build upon and complement each other; extensive cross-referencing directs the reader to relevant material elsewhere in the book  

 
Handbook of Road Ecology offers a comprehensive summary of approximately 30 years of global efforts to quantify the impacts of roads and traffic and implement effective mitigation. As such, it is essential reading for those involved in the planning, design, assessment and construction of new roads; the management and
 maintenance of existing roads; and the modifying or retrofitting of existing roads and problem locations. This handbook is an accessible resource for both developed and developing countries, including government transportation agencies, Government environmental/conservation agencies, NGOs, and road funding and donor organisations.

T1  - Nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria stimulates production in Baltic food webs
AN  - 1683722987
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Baltic Sea ecosystem-based management under climate change              Filamentous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria form extensive summer blooms in the Baltic Sea. Their ability to fix dissolved N2 allows cyanobacteria to circumvent the general summer nitrogen limitation, while also generating a supply of novel bioavailable nitrogen for the food web. However, the fate of the nitrogen fixed by cyanobacteria remains unresolved, as does its importance for secondary production in the Baltic Sea. Here, we synthesize recent experimental and field studies providing strong empirical evidence that cyanobacterial nitrogen is efficiently assimilated and transferred in Baltic food webs via two major pathways: directly by grazing on fresh or decaying cyanobacteria and indirectly through the uptake by other phytoplankton and microbes of bioavailable nitrogen exuded from cyanobacterial cells. This information is an essential step toward guiding nutrient management to minimize noxious blooms without overly reducing secondary production, and ultimately most probably fish production in the Baltic Sea.

T1  - Composition, Shell Strength, and Metabolizable Energy of Mulinia lateralis and Ischadium recurvum as Food for Wintering Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata)
AN  - 1681094752
AB  - Decline in surf scoter (Melanitta perspicillata) waterfowl populations wintering in the Chesapeake Bay has been associated with changes in the availability of benthic bivalves. The Bay has become more eutrophic, causing changes in the benthos available to surf scoters. The subsequent decline in oyster beds (Crassostrea virginica) has reduced the hard substrate needed by the hooked mussel (Ischadium recurvum), one of the primary prey items for surf scoters, causing the surf scoter to switch to a more opportune species, the dwarf surfclam (Mulinia lateralis). The composition (macronutrients, minerals, and amino acids), shell strength (N), and metabolizable energy (kJ) of these prey items were quantified to determine the relative foraging values for wintering scoters. Pooled samples of each prey item were analyzed to determine composition. Shell strength (N) was measured using a shell crack compression test. Total collection digestibility trials were conducted on eight captive surf scoters. For the prey size range commonly consumed by surf scoters (6–12 mm for M. lateralis and 18–24 mm for I. recurvum), I. recurvum contained higher ash, protein, lipid, and energy per individual organism than M. lateralis. I. recurvum required significantly greater force to crack the shell relative to M. lateralis. No difference in metabolized energy was observed for these prey items in wintering surf scoters, despite I. recurvum’s higher ash content and harder shell than M. lateralis. Therefore, wintering surf scoters were able to obtain the same amount of energy from each prey item, implying that they can sustain themselves if forced to switch prey.

T1  - Metabolic Activity and Functional Diversity Changes in Sediment Prokaryotic Communities Organically Enriched with Mussel Biodeposits
AN  - 1676622044
AB  - This experimental microcosm study reports the influence of organic enrichments by mussel biodeposits on the metabolic activity and functional diversity of benthic prokaryotic communities. The different biodeposit enrichment regimes created, which mimicked the quantity of faeces and pseudo-faeces potentially deposited below mussel farms, show a clear stimulatory effect of this organic enrichment on prokaryotic metabolic activity. This effect was detected once a certain level of biodeposition was attained with a tipping point estimated between 3.25 and 10 g day-1 m-2. Prokaryotic communities recovered their initial metabolic activity by 11 days after the cessation of biodeposit additions. However, their functional diversity remained greater than prior to the disturbance suggesting that mussel biodeposit enrichment may disturb the functioning and perhaps the role of prokaryotic communities in benthic ecosystems. This manipulative approach provided new information on the influence of mussel biodeposition on benthic prokaryotic communities and dose-response relationships and may support the development of carrying capacity models for bivalve culture.

T1  - Consequences of Lower Food Intake on the Digestive Enzymes Activities, the Energy Reserves and the Reproductive Outcome in Gammarus fossarum
AN  - 1673824818
AB  - Digestive enzyme activity is often used as a sensitive response to environmental pollution. However, only little is known about the negative effects of stress on digestive capacities and their consequences on energy reserves and reproduction, although these parameters are important for the maintenance of populations. To highlight if changes in biochemical responses (digestive enzymes and reserves) led to impairments at an individual level (fertility), Gammarus fossarum were submitted to a lower food intake throughout a complete female reproductive cycle (i.e. from ovogenesis to offspring production). For both males and females, amylase activity was inhibited by the diet stress, whereas trypsin activity was not influenced. These results underline similar sensitivity of males and females concerning their digestive capacity. Energy reserves decreased with food starvation in females, and remained stable in males. The number of embryos per female decreased with food starvation. Lower digestive activity in males and females therefore appears as an early response. These results underline the ecological relevance of digestive markers, as they make it possible to anticipate upcoming consequences on reproduction in females, a key biological variable for population dynamics.

T1  - Brooding in the Chilean Oyster Ostrea chilensis: Unexpected Complexity in the Movements of Brooded Offspring within the Mantle Cavity
AN  - 1673122294
AB  - Brooding in invertebrates serves to protect embryos from stressful external conditions by retaining progeny inside the female body, effectively reducing the risk of pelagic stages being exposed to predation or other environmental stressors, but with accompanying changes in pallial fluid characteristics, including reduced oxygen availability. Brooded embryos are usually immobile and often encapsulated, but in some Ostrea species the embryos move freely inside the female pallial cavity in close association with the mother’s gills for as long as eight weeks. We used endoscopic techniques to characterize the circulation pattern of embryos brooded by females of the oyster, Ostrea chilensis. Progeny at embryonic and veliger stages typically circulated in established patterns that included the use of dorsal and ventral food grooves (DFG, VFG) to move anteriorly on the gills. Both embryos and veligers accumulated around the mother’s palps, and remained there until an active maternal countercurrent moved them to the gill inhalant area. Both food grooves were able to move embryos, veligers, and food-particle aggregates anteriorly, but the DFG was more important in progeny transport; early embryos were moved more rapidly than veligers in the DFG. A microcirculation pattern of embryos was apparent when they were moved by gill lamellae: when they were close to the VFG, most embryos lost gill contact and ´´fell´´ down to the DFG. Those that actually reached the DFG moved anteriorly, but others came into contact with the base of the lamellae and again moved towards the VFG. The circulation pattern of the progeny appears well-suited for both cleaning them and directing them posteriorly to an area where there is more oxygen and food than in the palp region. This process for actively circulating progeny involves the feeding structures (gill and palps) and appears to be energetically costly for the female. It also interferes with feeding, which could explain the poor energy balance previously documented for brooding females of this species.

T1  - Maintaining Economic Value of Ecosystem Services Whilst Reducing Environmental Cost: A Way to Achieve Freshwater Restoration in China
AN  - 1666309708
AB  - Freshwater fisheries are central to food security in China and this remains one of the most important priorities for the growing human population. Thus, combining ecosystem restoration with economics is pivotal in setting successful conservation in China. Here, we have developed a practical management model that combines fishery improvement with conservation. For six years, a ban on fertilizer and a reduction of planktivorous fish stocking along with the introduction of both mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi and Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis was apparent in Wuhu Lake, a highly eutrophic lake located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Annual fish yield decreased slightly after the change in management, whereas fisheries income increased 2.6 times. Mandarin fish and Chinese mitten crab accounted for only 16% of total fisheries production but for 48% of total fisheries income. During this six year period, water clarity increased significantly from 61 cm to 111 cm. Total nitrogen, total phosphorus and chlorophyll decreased significantly from 1.14 to 0.84 mg/L, 0.077 to 0.045 mg/L, and 21.45 to 11.59 μg/L respectively, and macrophyte coverage increased by about 30%. Our results showed that the ecological status of shallow lakes could be rapidly reversed from eutrophic to oligotrophic using simple biomanipulation, whilst maintaining fisheries economic value. It also offers a better approach to shallow fisheries lake management in Asia where traditionally the stocking of Chinese carp and use of fertilizers is still popular.

T1  - Length- and weight-dependent clearance rates of juvenile mussels (Mytilus edulis) on various planktonic prey items
AN  - 1655676224
AB  - Filtration capacity and feeding behaviour has been intensely studied for adult mussels (Mytilus edulis), but less information is available for juvenile mussels (1.5-25 mm, <1 year), especially in natural sea water. The recent introduction of mussel seed collectors in the Netherlands prompted the need for more detailed information on juvenile mussel behaviour. To estimate the impact of juvenile populations on ecosystem carrying capacity, information on clearance rate as well as usage of different prey items is essential. Clearance rates were measured in an experimental study, incubating juvenile mussels in natural sea water. Rates were related to isometrics as well as specified for the prey items bacteria, picophytoplankton (<3 [mu]m), nanophytoplankton (3-20 [mu]m), and ciliates. Results showed that the clearance rate of juvenile mussels depends on shell length^sup 2^, while the relationship between clearance rate and weight was more variable. Length is thus a better parameter for estimating clearance rate than weight. Ciliates and nanophytoplankton were cleared at comparable, but variable rates, while picoalgae were cleared from the water at the rate of 11-64 % compared to nanophytoplankton. For bacteria, the clearance rate was on average 9 %. This study showed different retention of particles of similar size (picoalgae and bacteria) as well as variability in particle retention for the different prey items. This variable retention efficiency could not be related to seston concentration nor to dominance in cell size. The results from this study can be used to estimate the effect of mussel seed collectors on the carrying capacity of the Dutch Wadden Sea.

T1  - Response to "Prevent the Spread of Invasive Species"
AN  - 1643365684
AB  - Examine all the 'scary' invaders the media has warned us about. The Japanese long horn beetle, emerald ash borer, purple loose strife, spruce bud worm, and Dutch elm disease. These alien invaders make a big splash in the media and then they disappear. That is exactly what happens in nature. They become part of the natural landscape. I've lived with all of these organisms for over three decades and my landscape still has spruce, elm and ash trees.

              
What does tend to happen initially, for an alien species that finds an open niche, is an 'overpopulation' locally for a period of time but eventually a new population equilibrium is established because there are limited resources in any ecosystem, which becomes the limiting factor for any 'overpopulation.' The only way an invasive population can continue to expand is by importing those resources which are limited in its immediate vicinity. We can process economic trade, and the globalization of trade means the globalization of both alien species and disease organisms, i.e. west Nile virus. It is ironic that economic trade is responsible for the redistribution of most alien species.

              
Wouldn't it be refreshing if politicians, bureaucrats and the media learned a little natural history so their good intensions would have a sound biological basis. Then I'd be less suspicious of such legislation as just 'smoke and mirrors' to avoid dealing with the really important contemporary issues.

T1  - Impacts d’une Contamination Métallique sur le Métabolisme des Rétinoïdes et la Réponse au Stress Oxydant chez la Perchaude (Perca flavescens)
TT  - Impacts of Metal Contamination on Retinoid Metabolism and Oxidative Stress Response in Yellow Perch (Perca flavescens)
AN  - 2813649345
AB  - Généralement le terme « vitamine A » réfère à un groupe de molécules d’origine naturelle ayant une structure proche de celle du rétinol et capable d’exercer une activité biologique. En plus de jouer un rôle essentiel dans diverses fonctions physiologiques, certains rétinoïdes possèdent des propriétés antioxydantes. Cependant, l’action de lutte contre le stress oxydant ne sera efficace que si toutes les composantes du système de défense antioxydante, y compris enzymatiques, interagissent ensemble. Des études suggèrent qu’une exposition des poissons à certains métaux engendre un accroissement des espèces réactives à l’oxygène pouvant entrainer des dommages cellulaires graves. L’utilité de la perchaude (Perca flavescens) comme biomonitrice d’évaluation du risque des métaux en milieu naturel n’est plus à démontrer. C’est une espèce qui tolère la présence des métaux et les accumule dans ses tissus. Ubiquitaire en Amérique du Nord, elle domine dans certains lacs des zones minières et des fonderies du Canada, telle que la région de Rouyn-Noranda, Québec. Des preuves substantielles établissant un lien entre une exposition aux contaminants organiques et la perturbation du métabolisme des rétinoïdes existent. Cependant très peu d’études font état de l’impact des contaminants inorganiques, notamment celui des métaux, sur ce métabolisme. Ce projet de doctorat vise donc à évaluer les risques associés à la présence des métaux sur le métabolisme des rétinoïdes et à améliorer notre compréhension de l’impact des métaux sur les réponses au stress oxydant chez les poissons.L’hypothèse principale de l’étude postulait que les métaux, principalement le Cd, provoquent une perturbation du métabolisme des rétinoïdes par altération de l’action des enzymes clées, entraînant par la même occasion une accumulation anormale des métabolites dans les tissus des poissons. Quatre objectifs principaux ont été à la base de ce projet de doctorat. Le premier consistait à déterminer non seulement les impacts d’un gradient métallique sur le métabolisme des rétinoïdes, mais aussi la réponse des biomarqueurs du stress oxydant chez les populations de perchaudes sauvages. Afin d’atteindre cet objectif, nous avons échantillonné plusieurs lacs représentant un gradient de contamination métallique. Les résultats montrent que les poissons des lacs contaminés présentent des concentrations en rétinoïdes hépatiques et plasmatiques plus élevées. Ils suggèrent ainsi la mise en oeuvre des mécanismes de lutte contre le stress oxydant chez les poissons. De plus, bien que ces résultats concordent avec une augmentation du niveau de transcription du gène impliqué dans la synthèse de la rétinol déshydrogénase-2, ils contrastent cependant avec la diminution du pourcentage du déhydrorétinol libre observée dans le foie, traduisant alors un effet négatif des métaux sur les enzymes et/ou les protéines de liaison impliquées dans l’homéostasie des rétinoïdes. Conformément au postulat selon lequel une augmentation du niveau de transcription de la rétinol déshydrogénase-2 (rdh-2) accroit la protection contre le stress oxydant, nous avons observé une augmentation du niveau de transcription de la glucose-6-phosphate déshydrogénase (g6pdh) accompagnée d’une activité élevée de cette enzyme dans le foie. Par contre l’activité de la superoxide dismutase était faible. Cette faiblesse révèle que les métaux ont une influence négative sur les activités de certaines enzymes antioxydantes.Des études ont montré qu’en milieu naturel les variations saisonnières avaient une influence sur l’accumulation des métaux et sur la disponibilité des ressources alimentaires. C’est pourquoi le deuxième objectif de ce projet de doctorat a été de vérifier si une variation saisonnière des concentrations métalliques tissulaires avait des effets sur le métabolisme des rétinoïdes et sur la réponse des biomarqueurs du stress oxydant chez des perchaudes sauvages.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerGenerally the term "vitamin A" refers to a group of molecules of natural origin having a structure close to that of retinol and capable of exerting a biological activity. In addition to playing an essential role in various physiological functions, certain retinoids possess antioxidant properties. However, the action against oxidative stress will only be effective if all the components of the antioxidant defense system, including enzymes, interact together. Studies suggest that exposure of fish to certain metals leads to an increase in reactive oxygen species which can lead to serious cell damage. The usefulness of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) as a biomonitor for metal risk assessment in the natural environment is well established. It is a species that tolerates the presence of metals and accumulates them in its tissues. Ubiquitous in North America, it dominates in certain lakes in mining and foundry areas of Canada, such as the Rouyn-Noranda region, Quebec. Substantial evidence linking exposure to organic contaminants to disruption of retinoid metabolism exists. However, very few studies report the impact of inorganic contaminants, especially metals, on this metabolism. This doctoral project therefore aims to assess the risks associated with the presence of metals on the metabolism of retinoids and to improve our understanding of the impact of metals on responses to oxidative stress in fish.The main hypothesis of the study postulated that metals, mainly Cd, cause a disturbance of the metabolism of retinoids by altering the action of key enzymes, at the same time leading to an abnormal accumulation of metabolites in fish tissues. Four main objectives were the basis of this doctoral project. The first was to determine not only the impacts of a metal gradient on retinoid metabolism, but also the response of oxidative stress biomarkers in wild yellow perch populations. In order to achieve this objective, we sampled several lakes representing a gradient of metal contamination. The results show that fish from contaminated lakes have higher hepatic and plasma retinoid concentrations. They thus suggest the implementation of mechanisms to fight against oxidative stress in fish. Moreover, although these results are consistent with an increase in the level of transcription of the gene involved in the synthesis of retinol dehydrogenase-2, they contrast however with the decrease in the percentage of free dehydroretinol observed in the liver, thus reflecting a negative effect of metals on binding enzymes and/or proteins involved in retinoid homeostasis. In accordance with the postulate that an increase in the level of transcription of retinol dehydrogenase-2 (rdh-2) increases protection against oxidative stress, we observed an increase in the level of transcription of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6pdh) accompanied by elevated activity of this enzyme in the liver. On the other hand, the activity of superoxide dismutase was weak. This weakness reveals that metals have a negative influence on the activities of certain antioxidant enzymes.Studies have shown that in the natural environment, seasonal variations have an influence on the accumulation of metals and on the availability of food resources. This is why the second objective of this doctoral project was to verify whether a seasonal variation in tissue metal concentrations had effects on the metabolism of retinoids and on the response of biomarkers of oxidative stress in wild yellow perch.

AB  - Le sélénium (Se) est un élément essentiel, mais une concentration interne cinq fois plus élevée que celle nécessaire peut induire des effets toxiques. Son écotoxicologie a été très étudiée, mais plusieurs mécanismes d’accumulation et d’effet ne sont pas compris. Nous avons mesuré les concentrations de trois espèces chimiques du sélénium (sélénite, séléniate et séléniures organiques) dans l’eau d’une quinzaine de lacs des régions de Sudbury, Ontario et Rouyn-Noranda, Québec. Ces mesures ont été comparées avec les concentrations de sélénium ([Se]) dans une chaîne trophique planctonique composée de microplancton (algues et bactéries), de crustacés planctoniques et de larves du diptère Chaoborus. Ce sont les concentrations de séléniures organiques dissous qui sont les mieux corrélées avec les [Se] dans cette chaîne trophique, mais l’addition des concentrations de séléniate rend les corrélations plus fortes. Afin de comprendre les mécanismes derrière ces observations, nous avons exposé l’algue verte unicellulaire Chalmydomonas reinhardtii à la même concentration de sélénite, de séléniate ou de sélénométhionine, au laboratoire, mais à des concentrations variables de sulfate, d’ions hydrogène et ce, pour plusieurs durées d’exposition. Ces expériences démontrent que l’accumulation par cette algue verte est plus importante lorsqu’exposée au séléniate qu’au sélénite, mais à des concentrations de sulfate très élevées, la prise en charge de sélénite est un peu plus importante. Par contre, l’accumulation de sélénométhionine n’a pas été influencée par les concentrations de sulfate. À des [SO4] représentatives des lacs étudiés, les [Se] chez l’algue étaient trois fois plus élevées lorsqu’exposée à la sélénométhionine qu’aux espèces inorganiques. Dans toutes les conditions expérimentales, les [Se] chez C. reinhardtii étaient faibles comparativement à celles mesurées dans le microplancton naturel des lacs, et ce à de plus faibles concentrations aqueuses. Nous avons donc récolté le microplancton du lac Bédard (lac témoin) au nord de la ville de Québec et exposé ces organismes aux mêmes conditions que l’algue verte. Ces expériences démontrent que les [Se] chez microplancton naturel étaient 30 fois plus élevées que celles de C. reinhardtii lorsqu’exposés à la sélénométhionine. Contrairement à l’algue, les [Se] chez le microplancton étaient plus élevées lorsqu’exposé au sélénite qu’au séléniate. De façon générale, pour une concentration donnée de Se dissous, l’accumulation de la forme organique sera supérieure à celle observée pour les formes inorganiques, mais l’accumulation préférentielle des espèces chimiques du sélénium est étroitement liée aux types de micro-organisme étudiés. Ces données de laboratoire nous ont permis d’estimer les [Se] mesurées chez les organismes pélagiques des lacs étudiés.Nous n’avons pas observé de bioamplification du Se dans la chaîne trophique pélagique constituée d’invertébrés et de microplancton pélagiques, mais une bioamplification du Se a été observée entre les perchaudes et leur proie. De plus, lorsque les perchaudes se nourrissent davantage de proies venant des sédiments, elles sont exposées à des [Se] plus élevées. Effectivement, nous avons obtenu des régressions négatives entre la signature isotopique de soufre (δ34S) et les [Se] dans les perchaudes et leurs proies suggérant que plus les organismes se nourrissent dans un environnement anoxique, plus ils sont exposés au Se. Les chironomes qui consomment les sédiments (p. ex. Chironomus) sont les invertébrés avec les plus fortes [Se]. Nous suggérons donc de les utiliser pour les évaluations du risque environnemental afin d’estimer l’exposition maximale potentielle des perchaudes.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerSelenium (Se) is an essential element, but an internal concentration five times higher than that necessary can induce toxic effects. Its ecotoxicology has been extensively studied, but several mechanisms of accumulation and effect are not understood. We measured the concentrations of three chemical species of selenium (selenite, selenate and organic selenides) in the water of fifteen lakes in the regions of Sudbury, Ontario and Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. These measurements were compared with the concentrations of selenium ([Se]) in a planktonic trophic chain composed of microplankton (algae and bacteria), planktonic crustaceans and larvae of the Diptera Chaoborus. Dissolved organic selenide concentrations correlate best with [Se] in this food chain, but adding selenate concentrations makes the correlations stronger. In order to understand the mechanisms behind these observations, we exposed the unicellular green alga Chalmydomonas reinhardtii to the same concentration of selenite, selenate or selenomethionine, in the laboratory, but to varying concentrations of sulphate, hydrogen ions and this, for multiple exposure times. These experiments demonstrate that the accumulation by this green algae is greater when exposed to selenate than to selenite, but at very high sulfate concentrations, the uptake of selenite is somewhat greater. In contrast, selenomethionine accumulation was not influenced by sulfate concentrations. At [SO4] representative of the lakes studied, the [Se] in the algae was three times higher when exposed to selenomethionine than to the inorganic species. In all experimental conditions, [Se] in C. reinhardtii were low compared to those measured in natural lake microplankton, at lower aqueous concentrations. We therefore collected microplankton from Lac Bédard (control lake) north of Quebec City and exposed these organisms to the same conditions as green algae. These experiments demonstrate that the [Se] in natural microplankton was 30 times higher than that of C. reinhardtii when exposed to selenomethionine. Unlike algae, [Se] in microplankton were higher when exposed to selenite than to selenate. In general, for a given concentration of dissolved Se, the accumulation of the organic form will be greater than that observed for the inorganic forms, but the preferential accumulation of the chemical species of selenium is closely linked to the types of microorganisms studied. These laboratory data allowed us to estimate the [Se] measured in the pelagic organisms of the lakes studied.We did not observe Se biomagnification in the pelagic food chain consisting of pelagic invertebrates and microplankton, but Se biomagnification was observed between yellow perch and their prey. In addition, when yellow perch feed more on sediment prey, they are exposed to higher [Se]. Indeed, we obtained negative regressions between the isotopic signature of sulfur (δ34S) and [Se] in yellow perch and their prey suggesting that the more organisms feed in an anoxic environment, the more they are exposed to Se. Sediment-eating chironomids (eg Chironomus) are the invertebrates with the highest [Se]. We therefore suggest using them for environmental risk assessments to estimate the maximum potential exposure of yellow perch.

AB  - Human-related activities have increased the fluxes of many trace elements from the earth‘s crust. Trace elements can reach freshwater ecosystems, where they can be readily accumulated, leading to toxic effects. As a result of the need to evaluate the effects of such contaminants on the environment, ecological risk assessments for trace elements have been developed in the last decades. These approaches used to assess the risk posed by trace metal contamination involve three main components: metal availability, metal bioaccumulation and metal toxicity. In this context, significant progress has been made in relating the chemical speciation of trace elements to their bioaccumulation and toxicity for a variety of aquatic organisms, but they have not been completely successful in predicting the toxicity of trace elements. One important element to be refined in such models is the estimation of the subcellular metal concentrations that are likely to be responsible for adverse effects in living cells. Such subcellular estimations will also reveal the metal-handling strategies that aquatic organisms use to cope with these contaminants. Furthermore, detailed characterizations of the biomolecules either involved in metal-detoxification responses or targeted by the trace metals are also required to better understand intracellular metal-trafficking in aquatic organisms chronically exposed in the environment.To do so, two aquatic animals with differing tolerance to trace metals were collected from metal-contaminated environments, final-instar larvae of the insect Chaoborus and North Atlantic yellow eels (A. anguilla and A. rostrata). A subcellular partitioning procedure using differential centrifugation, NaOH digestion and thermal shock steps was applied to obtain putative metal-sensitive fractions (heat-denatured proteins, mitochondria, microsomes and lysosomes) and detoxified metal fractions (heat-stable proteins and NaOH-resistant granules). To analyse metal complexes with intracellular biomolecules, a metallomic approach based on SEC-ICPMS analysis was applied to the insect.The subcellular partitioning of trace metals in these aquatic organisms revealed the metal-handling strategies used by these animals to prevent the binding of non-essential metals at physiologically important sites. Metal sequestration by metallothioneins or metallothionein-like proteins played an important role in metal detoxification (e.g., Cd, Ag). In this respect, the hyphenated analysis of the cytosolic fractions of Chaoborus showed that distinct thermostable proteins (or MT isoforms) are involved in Cd sequestration. Incorporation of metals such as Ni, Pb and Tl into mineral inclusions appears to be another important and complementary metal-detoxification strategy. These strategies were not completely successful since significant accumulations in metal-sensitive fractions were observed for all the metals studied; even for animals collected from references sites exposed at the lower end of the metal contamination gradient. These inappropriate bindings of non-essential metals could induce deleterious effects. Among the metal-sensitive fractions, mitochondria appear to be a major binding compartment (for As, Cd, Pb and Tl). The percentage of accumulated trace metals stored in detoxified form varied greatly among metals and animals. Such information should help the development of improved models for predicting metal toxicity, based on the biologically active pools that contribute to toxic responses and not on the total accumulated metal concentrations.Alternate abstract:Les activités humaines ont augmenté le flux de plusieurs métaux traces. Ces métaux peuvent atteindre des systèmes aquatiques où ils peuvent être accumulés par des organismes pouvant entraîner des effets toxiques. Afin d‘évaluer les effets de ces contaminants dans l‘environnement, des évaluations de risque environnemental ont été développées. Ces approches ayant comme objectif d‘évaluer la probabilité des effets adverses causés par l‘exposition de contaminants métalliques ont généralement trois composantes principales : exposition, bioaccumulation et toxicité. Dans ce contexte, différents modèles ont été développés afin de lier la spéciation chimique des éléments traces avec la bioaccumulation et la toxicité. Néanmoins, des modèles ne sont pas capables de déterminer le métal qui est biologiquement actif et donc qui peut être responsable pour les effets adverses. Des mesures de fractionnement subcellulaire de métaux traces qui permettent la séparation des formes détoxiquées et les fractions contribuant aux effets toxiques sont nécessaires pour mieux comprendre la relation entre la bioaccumulation et toxicité des métaux traces. De telles études peuvent aussi révéler les stratégies de gestion de métaux traces utilisées par les organismes aquatiques afin de faire face à ces contaminants. De plus, des caractérisations détaillées des biomolécules qui sont impliquées dans les réponses de détoxication ou sensibles aux métaux traces sont nécessaires pour mieux comprendre la spéciation intracellulaire des métaux traces.Pour ce faire, deux organismes aquatiques ayant des tolérances différentes à ces contaminants ont été récoltés dans le milieu naturel : des larves de Chaoborus et des anguilles nord-atlantiques (A. anguilla et A. rostrata). Un protocole de répartition subcellulaire incluant des étapes de centrifugation différentielle, digestion avec hydroxyde de sodium et traitement thermique a été appliqué pour déterminer les concentrations de métaux trouvés dans le compartiment de métaux détoxiqués de celui dites sensible telles que dans les fractions de protéines thermosensibles, les mitochondries et d‘autres organites. Pour analyser des complexes métalliques avec des biomolécules intracellulaires, une approche métallomique basée sur l'analyse SEC-ICPMS a été aussi appliquée chez les larves de l'insecte.La répartition subcellulaire de métaux traces chez les organismes aquatiques étudiés a révélé des stratégies intracellulaires de gestions de métaux par ces animaux afin de prévenir la liaison de ces métaux non essentiels avec des sites physiologiquement importants. La séquestration de métaux par les métallothionéines ou par des protéines semblables aux métallothionéines joue un rôle important dans la détoxication des métaux (par exemple Cd, Ag). À cet égard, l'analyse métallomique des fractions du cytosol de Chaoborus a montré que différentes protéines thermostables (ou isoformes de métallothionéines) sont impliquées dans la séquestration du Cd. L'incorporation de métaux tels que Ni, Pb et Tl en inclusions minérales semble être une autre stratégie importante et complémentaire de détoxication de ces métaux. Cependant, ces stratégies de détoxication n‘ont pas été complètement efficaces pour éviter des accumulations de métaux traces dans les fractions sensibles, même chez des organismes exposés à des faibles concentrations de métaux traces. Ces liaisons de métaux avec des sites inappropriés peuvent induire des effets délétères chez les organismes étudies. Parmi les sites sensibles étudiés, les mitochondries, où des processus biochimiques importants ont lieu, se sont révélés comme la fraction la plus importante en concentrations de ces contaminants potentiellement toxiques (par exemple, pour l‘As, le Cd, le Pb et le Tl). Le pourcentage d‘un métal trace qui est détoxiquée a varié entre les métaux et les organismes étudiés. L‘ensemble des informations peuvent être utiles pour raffiner les évaluations de risque en précisant les concentrations de métaux accumulées qui sont susceptibles de causer des effets néfastes.

T1  - Écotoxicité des nanotubes de carbone mono-paroi chez des invertébrés aquatiques: influence de facteurs abiotiques
TT  - Ecotoxicity of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes in Aquatic Invertebrates: Influence of Abiotic Factors
AN  - 2812065804
AB  - Ces dernières années, la production et l’utilisation des nanomatériaux se sont accrues. En effet, de nombreux secteurs peuvent tirer des bénéfices de l’incorporation de nanomatériaux dans leurs produits tels que l’électronique, le pharmaceutique ou encore la cosmétique. Parmi les nanomatériaux, les nanotubes de carbone tiennent une place importante. Ils sont déjà présents dans du matériel électronique et sportif et l’on envisage de les utiliser pour l’élimination des contaminants présents dans l’eau ou encore pour la vectorisation de molécules thérapeutiques. La présence des nanomatériaux dans l’environnement va donc augmenter et il est primordial d’évaluer leurs effets toxiques potentiels sur les organismes susceptibles de se retrouver en contact avec eux.Ce projet de recherche avait pour but d’étudier l’écotoxicité des nanotubes de carbone monoparoi (SWCNT) et l’influence de divers paramètres extérieurs, à l’aide de trois organismes aquatiques : l’amphipode Hyalella azteca, la daphnie Daphnia magna et la moule Elliptio complanata. Pour la réalisation des travaux, 3 sous-objectifs ont été définis : 1) déterminer l’influence de facteurs abiotiques sur la toxicité des nanotubes de carbone ; 2) étudier les effets indirects des nanotubes de carbone par une étude préliminaire des effets de l’adsorption d’un métal toxique sur les organismes présents dans le milieu, à l’aide de tests de toxicité ; et 3) mesurer les effets sous létaux des nanotubes de carbone seuls et co-exposé à un métal toxique à l’aide de biomarqueurs cellulaires et moléculaires.Les résultats obtenus ont révélé une diminution de la survie et de la croissance des hyalelles exposées aux nanotubes de carbone mono-paroi en fonction de la durée d’exposition. De plus, nous avons constaté que la présence de sédiment artificiel, non contaminé, diminuait la toxicité des nanotubes de carbone bruts dispersés dans le milieu d’exposition. La deuxième partie du projet nous a permis de calculer un faible taux d’adsorption du cadmium par les SWCNT (24,4 mg Cd /kg SWCNT). De plus, la présence de nanotubes de carbone bruts à une concentration non toxique (500 ou 1 000 μg/L) a augmenté la toxicité du cadmium pour la daphnie D. magna d’un facteur 2. Nous avons donc poursuivi l’étude des effets indirects des SWCNT, et, la dernière partie du projet a permis d’observer que les nanotubes de carbone bruts et purifiés avaient la capacité d’induire des dommages à l’ADN et qu’il existait un effet potentialisateur des nanotubes de carbone vis-à-vis du cadmium à de faibles concentrations (500 μg/L pour les SWCNT et 20 μg/L pour le Cd). Par contre, aucun effet n’a été observé au niveau du stress oxydant et des paramètres immunitaires.L’ensemble de ces résultats nous indique la complexité de l’étude des effets écotoxicologiques des nanomatériaux et l’importance de considérer les facteurs environnementaux, en particulier la présence des sédiments et celle de contaminants. De plus, ce travail met en avant l’intérêt d’utiliser des approches complémentaires. Nos résultats indiquent qu’il est essentiel de caractériser les nanomatériaux étudiés et notamment l’état d’agglomération. Enfin, généralement, tout comme dans la première partie de ce travail, les effets toxiques directs sont mesurés à des concentrations élevées. Ces concentrations sont éloignées de celles qui sont estimées dans l’environnement. Par contre, les effets indirects via les interactions avec d’autres contaminants peuvent intervenir à des concentrations beaucoup plus faibles. Dans le futur, il serait pertinent de poursuivre l’étude des effets d’interactions entre les nanotubes de carbone et les contaminants présents dans le milieu aquatique tels que les métaux ou les composants organiques.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Indeed, many sectors can benefit from the incorporation of nanomaterials in their products such as electronics, pharmaceuticals or cosmetics. Among nanomaterials, carbon nanotubes hold an important place. They are already present in electronic and sports equipment and we plan to use them for the elimination of contaminants present in water or for the vectorization of therapeutic molecules. The presence of nanomaterials in the environment will therefore increase and it is essential to assess their potential toxic effects on organisms likely to come into contact with them.The aim of this research project was to study the ecotoxicity of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and the influence of various external parameters, using three aquatic organisms: the amphipod Hyalella azteca, the daphnia Daphnia magna and the Elliptio complanata mussel. To carry out the work, 3 sub-objectives were defined: 1) determine the influence of abiotic factors on the toxicity of carbon nanotubes; 2) study the indirect effects of carbon nanotubes by a preliminary study of the effects of the adsorption of a toxic metal on the organisms present in the environment, using toxicity tests; and 3) measure the sub-lethal effects of carbon nanotubes alone and co-exposed to a toxic metal using cellular and molecular biomarkers.The results obtained revealed a decrease in the survival and growth of hyalellae exposed to single-walled carbon nanotubes as a function of the duration of exposure. Additionally, we found that the presence of artificial, uncontaminated sediment decreased the toxicity of crude carbon nanotubes dispersed in the exposure medium. The second part of the project allowed us to calculate a low adsorption rate of cadmium by the SWCNTs (24.4 mg Cd / kg SWCNT). In addition, the presence of crude carbon nanotubes at a non-toxic concentration (500 or 1000 μg/L) increased the toxicity of cadmium for daphnia D. magna by a factor of 2. We therefore continued the study of the indirect effects of SWCNTs, and, the last part of the project made it possible to observe that raw and purified carbon nanotubes had the capacity to induce DNA damage and that there was a potentiating effect of carbon nanotubes vis -to cadmium at low concentrations (500 μg/L for SWCNTs and 20 μg/L for Cd). On the other hand, no effect was observed on the level of oxidative stress and immune parameters.All of these results indicate the complexity of the study of the ecotoxicological effects of nanomaterials and the importance of considering environmental factors, in particular the presence of sediments and that of contaminants. In addition, this work highlights the interest of using complementary approaches. Our results indicate that it is essential to characterize the studied nanomaterials and in particular the state of agglomeration. Finally, generally, as in the first part of this work, the direct toxic effects are measured at high concentrations. These concentrations are far from those estimated in the environment. On the other hand, indirect effects via interactions with other contaminants can occur at much lower concentrations. In the future, it would be relevant to continue studying the effects of interactions between carbon nanotubes and contaminants present in the aquatic environment such as metals or organic compounds.

T1  - Mercury concentration in bivalve molluscs
AN  - 2545234318
AB  - A total of 85 mussel samples of eight species were examined. Analysis of mercury in the freeze-dried samples was carried out by atomic absorption spectrometry method using direct mercury analyser AMA 254. The analytical procedure for determination of mercury was covered by the quality assurance programme of research and participation in national and international proficiency tests. Concentrations of total mercury in all investigated samples were found to be generally low, in the range of 0.033-0.577 mg/kg of dry weight and of 0.003-0.045 mg/kg of wet weight. The results indicate that obtained levels of mercury in bivalve molluscs are not likely to pose a risk to the health of consumers.

T1  - Importation and Transmission of Parasitic and Other Infectious Diseases Associated with International Adoptees and Refugees Immigrating into the United States of America
AN  - 1731736454
AB  - Each year, hundreds of millions of people travel across international borders or even oceans, and up to 230 million may remain for long periods.  Among these, 3-5 million settle permanently in their new homes, with about 1 million migrating permanently to the United States of America. This may result in transport of parasites and other pathogens, which might become established, infecting individuals in the new location.  Beyond concern of disease spread, the health of migrants is of concern since the rigors, circumstances, and living conditions surrounding migrations may increase the vulnerability of migrants to infections.  International adoptees and refugees are a small subset of these migrants but are of special significance inasmuch as adoptees may be more vulnerable to infection due to their immature immune status, and refugees may be more vulnerable due to substandard living conditions.  Both originate from diverse regions, but often from environments of low hygiene and health care standards.  This review examines recent examples of infections reported from adoptees and refugees entering the USA through 2010, highlighting the most common origin countries and the diseases most frequently involved, including Chagas disease, Balamuthia amebic meningoencephalitis, giardiasis, microsporidiosis, hepatitis, measles, pertussis, tuberculosis, malaria, intestinal helminths, and syphilis.

T1  - The Fate of Microcystins in the Environment and Challenges for Monitoring
AN  - 1706292551
AB  - Microcystins are secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria that act as hepatotoxins in higher organisms. These toxins can be altered through abiotic processes, such as photodegradation and adsorption, as well as through biological processes via metabolism and bacterial degradation. Some species of bacteria can degrade microcystins, and many other organisms metabolize microcystins into a series of conjugated products. There are toxicokinetic models used to examine microcystin uptake and elimination, which can be difficult to compare due to differences in compartmentalization and speciation. Metabolites of microcystins are formed as a detoxification mechanism, and little is known about how quickly these metabolites are formed. In summary, microcystins can undergo abiotic and biotic processes that alter the toxicity and structure of the microcystin molecule. The environmental impact and toxicity of these alterations and the metabolism of microcystins remains uncertain, making it difficult to establish guidelines for human health. Here, we present the current state of knowledge regarding the alterations microcystins can undergo in the environment.

T1  - Invasive species legislation reintroduced at Queen's Park
AN  - 1628478072
AB  - "Invasive species like zebra mussels cost the Ontario economy tens of millions of dollars every year. Others, like Asian carp, have the potential to do long-lasting damage to our economic and environmental systems, such as significantly impacting our $2.2-billion recreational fishing industry," said senior media relations officer Jolanta Kowalski. "The proposed legislation would benefit all of Ontario, including the Muskoka area."

              
"Preventing invasive species from arriving and becoming established in Ontario is critical in our fight against this growing threat," said Kowalski. "Evidence has shown that the costs associated with controlling an established invasive species are generally higher than those associated with preventing invasive species from becoming established."

              
"It's missing fish species that are known to be invasive in other neighbouring jurisdictions but are not yet here," she said. "That's a potential loophole because they could be brought into the province."

T1  - An investigation into the effectiveness of mechanical dredging to remove Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774) from test plots in an Irish river system
AN  - 2287017730
AB  - The invasive Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774) has established a high density and self-sustaining population within the tidal reaches of the River Barrow, Ireland. A field trial was carried out to test the respective efficacy of three different mechanical dredge methods at reducing Corbicula clam numbers by estimating changes in abundance and biomass immediately following dredging. Quadrat samples were collected by SCUBA divers before and after dredging. A maximum pre-dredge density of 17,872 individuals/m2 and a biomass of 43.94 kg/m2 was recorded. Three sites which supported different population density and biomass levels within the tidal section of the River Barrow were subject to each of the dredge methods. A reduction of greater than 95% biomass and 95% density was achieved at the high density, high biomass site, while an 82% biomass and 65% density reduction was recorded at the low density, low biomass site. A 74% biomass and 92% density reduction was achieved at the high density, low biomass site. The methodology and results indicate that, while dredging can achieve a large reduction in Corbicula population numbers, further research is required before this can be considered as a management tool for control of Asian clams.

T1  - Native Fishes of Ohio
AN  - 2132078223
AB  - Ohio’s original heavily forested landscape included glacial lakes, large rivers, and streams that teemed with an abundant variety of fish, most of which remain resident today. Native Fishes of Ohio documents the more than 130 species originally found in the state and describes how their aquatic habitats have evolved as a result of agriculture and industrial development. Naturalist Dan Rice and photographer Gary Meszaros draw upon more than 40 years of fieldwork and recent hands-on experience to detail the natural history of each species of Ohio fish. The authors provide field identification characteristics and describe each fish’s habitat, ecology, and distribution. The book is profusely illustrated with Gary Meszaros’s spectacular color photographs of live specimens in their natural environment, a resource unique to this volume. The range of shapes and vivid colors will give the reader insight into the fascinating world of the state’s native fishes. An ideal resource for the nonspecialist, Native Fishes of Ohio will interest nature lovers, teachers, and anglers and is a must for every Ohio school and public library.

AN  - 2131079553
AB  - There is need in environmental research for a book on fresh waters including rivers and lakes. Compared with other books on the topic, this book has a unique outline in that it follows pollution from sources to impact. Included in the text is the treatment of various tracers, ranging from pathogens to stable isotopes of elements and providing a comprehensive discussion which is lacking in many other books on pollution control of natural waters. Geophysical processes are discussed emphasizing mixing of water, interaction between water and the atmosphere, and sedimentation processes. Important geochemistry processes occurring in natural waters are described as are the processes specific to nutrients, organic pollutants, metals, and pathogens in subsequent chapters. Each of these chapters includes an introduction on the selected groups, followed by the physicochemical properties which are the most relevant to their behavior in natural waters, and the theories and models to describe their speciation, transport and transformation. The book also includes the most up to date information including a discussion on emerging pollutants such as brominated and phosphate flame retardants, perflurochemicals, and pharmaceutical and personal care products. Due to its importance an ecotoxicology chapter has been included featuring molecular biological methods, nanoparticles, and comparison of the basis of biotic ligand model with the Weibull dose-response model. Finally, the last chapter briefly summarizes the regulations on ambient water quality.There is need in environmental research for a book on fresh waters including rivers and lakes.

T1  - Phylogenies of Microcystin-Producing Cyanobacteria in the Lower Laurentian Great Lakes Suggest Extensive Genetic Connectivity
AN  - 1561282966
AB  - Lake St. Clair is the smallest lake in the Laurentian Great Lakes system. MODIS satellite imagery suggests that high algal biomass events have occurred annually along the southern shore during late summer. In this study, we evaluated these events and tested the hypothesis that summer bloom material derived from Lake St. Clair may enter Lake Erie via the Detroit River and represent an overlooked source of potentially toxic Microcystis biomass to the western basin of Lake Erie. We conducted a seasonally and spatially resolved study carried out in the summer of 2013. Our goals were to: 1) track the development of the 2013 summer south-east shore bloom 2) conduct a spatial survey to characterize the extent of toxicity, taxonomic diversity of the total phytoplankton population and the phylogenetic diversity of potential MC-producing cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Planktothrix and Anabaena) during a high biomass event, and 3) compare the strains of potential MC-producers in Lake St. Clair with strains from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Our results demonstrated a clear predominance of cyanobacteria during a late August bloom event, primarily dominated by Microcystis, which we traced along the Lake St. Clair coastline downstream to the Detroit River's outflow at Lake Erie. Microcystin levels exceeded the Province of Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standard (1.5 µg L−1) for safe drinking water at most sites, reaching up to five times this level in some areas. Microcystis was the predominant microcystin producer, and all toxic Microcystis strains found in Lake St. Clair were genetically similar to toxic Microcystis strains found in lakes Erie and Ontario. These findings suggest extensive genetic connectivity among the three systems.

T1  - Not moving firewood can help curb the spread of invasive species
AN  - 1558286411
AB  - One does not have to look very far to see and hear stories of invasive species and the environmental damage they can cause. They take many forms and can affect different elements of our ecosystem. Certainly, few people have not heard about zebra mussels and how they have spread to so many of our water bodies. How about the Asian carp - displacing native species in waterways in North America and videos showing how dangerous it is to boat through those waterways as the fish literally jump into the boat endangering passengers. Then there is the round goby - a fish from Eurasia that has displaced native fish species in more and more of our water bodies - thought to originally have been introduced through ballast water of ships. Spiny waterflea, Eurasian water-milfoil, garlic mustard, dog-strangling vine ... the list goes on of damaging invasive species in Ontario. It is thought that the Asian long-horned beetle was introduced to the Toronto area by way of wooden shipping pallets. Thirty thousand trees were removed in an effort to stop its spread and it was declared eradicated from that infestation in the spring of 2013. Unfortunately, another infestation was found in August 2013 near the Pearson airport, requiring all infested and susceptible trees within 800 metres removed in an effort to stop that infestation from spreading. If this insect was able to spread to the broader forests of central Ontario, including Parry Sound-Muskoka, I shudder at what the impacts would be as all maples, birches, poplars and willows could succumb to this insect. People should particularly familiarize themselves with giant hogweed. This invasive plant has been found in isolated places in our region. What makes it of particular concern, is that it is poisonous requiring a person to wash their skin immediately in cool soapy water and not to expose the affected area to sunlight. It can reach over three metres tall so a person's skin can easily come in contact with this plant. A simple Internet search can help identify this noxious weed. These invasive species often have no native enemies here so can quickly build up populations and dominate their environments.

AB  - "We're happy with the dogs and I've talked to my department, we might even get our own... It's amazing to see how small the larvae really are but those dogs sniffed them out, no problem," said Robin Campbell, Alberta's minister of environment and sustainable resource development.              "Dogs, because they search with their noses, they're not distracted by visual clutter," [Pete Coppolillo] said. "They can know what's inside cracks and unexposed spaces, even without physically getting into those spaces. That just makes them much more efficient, more effective and sensitive. They can detect scents in the parts per billion."              "What makes them good scent dogs, the characteristics that we look for, are often the ones that land these dogs in the shelter," Coppolillo said. "They're high-drive, they're obsessive, they want to go, go, go, all day long. Interestingly, they do calm down when they're working, because they've got that mental stimulation and they do have a job."

T1  - Looking for a needle in a haystack: molecular detection of larvae of invasive Corbicula clams
AN  - 2287016438
AB  - The invasive bivalves Corbicula spp. and Limnoperna fortunei predominate in South American rivers. They can be sympatric in distribution, and because their larval stages are morphologically similar, monitoring them in zooplankton using microscopy protocols is often inefficient, producing ambiguous results. We designed a pair of primers to amplify a fragment of the mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I of Corbicula species. A multiplex reaction, containing the specific primer pair and a pair of universal primers (to control for the quality of the DNA in the sample) was tested with regards to specificity and ability to detect Corbicula spp. larvae in plankton samples that also contain other species in different proportions. Our molecular protocol allows for fast and accurate detection of Corbicula spp. even when concentrations of these species are low in samples, which is useful when examining large volumes of ballast/piped water. Further, the protocol is valuable for the monitoring/prospecting of early stages of the life cycle of Corbicula spp. in watersheds that have been invaded, or which are considered at risk of invasion by these species.

T1  - Future Oceanic Warming and Acidification Alter Immune Response and Disease Status in a Commercial Shellfish Species, Mytilus edulis L.
AN  - 1978565551
AB  - Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide are leading to physical changes in marine environments including parallel decreases in ocean pH and increases in seawater temperature. This study examined the impacts of a six month exposure to combined decreased pH and increased temperature on the immune response and disease status in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis L. Results provide the first confirmation that exposure to future acidification and warming conditions via aquarium-based simulation may have parallel implications for bivalve health. Collectively, the data suggests that temperature more than pH may be the key driver affecting immune response in M. edulis. Data also suggests that both increases in temperature and/or lowered pH conditions may lead to changes in parasite abundance and diversity, pathological conditions, and bacterial incidence in M. edulis. These results have implications for future management of shellfish under a predicted climate change scenario and future sustainability of shellfisheries. Examination of the combined effects of two stressors over an extended exposure period provides key preliminary data and thus, this work represents a unique and vital contribution to current research efforts towards a collective understanding of expected near-future impacts of climate change on marine environments.

T1  - Searching for "Environmentally-Benign" Antifouling Biocides
AN  - 1540859859
AB  - As the result of the ecological impacts from the use of tributyltins (TBT) in shipping, environmental legislation for the registration of chemicals for use in the environment has grown to a monumental challenge requiring product dossiers to include information on the environmental fate and behavior of any chemicals. Specifically, persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity, collectively known as PBT, are properties of concern in the assessment of chemicals. However, existing measurements of PBT properties are a cumbersome and expensive process, and thus not applied in the early stages of the product discovery and development. Inexpensive methods for preliminary PBT screening would minimize risks arising with the subsequent registration of products. In this article, we evaluated the PBT properties of compounds reported to possess anti-fouling properties using QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) prediction programs such as BIOWIN(TM) (a biodegradation probability program), KOWWIN(TM) (log octanol-water partition coefficient calculation program) and ECOSAR(TM) (Ecological Structure Activity Relationship Programme). The analyses identified some small (Mr < 400) synthetic and natural products as potential candidates for environmentally benign biocides. We aim to demonstrate that while these methods of estimation have limitations, when applied with discretion, they are powerful tools useful in the early stages of research for compound selection for further development as anti-foulants.

T1  - What is it like to take care of the land? Toward an understanding of private land conservation
AN  - 1532505378
AB  - Land conversion for agriculture, residential developments and infrastructure expansion is one of the main problems in environmental conservation. Government policies for public lands alone are unlikely to stem these dynamics. It is increasingly recognized that private land conservation is an essential part of environmental protection and especially properties of non-farm, private landowners are interesting for conservation purposes. However, non-farm, private landowners are less likely to respond to traditional motivators for environmental conservation and little is known about the conservation attitudes and values of this group. Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis was used as the approach because of its practical ability to reveal how personal contexts and experiences shape these relationships and how personal meaning is created. These relationships increase quality of life, give a sense of belonging, and motivate a desire to protect the land against environmental degradation. The present private landowners expressed a well-developed conservation ethic. However, future conservation approaches for these properties are less clear, but might be achieved through conservation easement programs.

T1  - Long-Term Citizen-Collected Data Reveal Geographical Patterns and Temporal Trends in Lake Water Clarity
AN  - 1520143204
AB  - We compiled a lake-water clarity database using publically available, citizen volunteer observations made between 1938 and 2012 across eight states in the Upper Midwest, USA. Our objectives were to determine (1) whether temporal trends in lake-water clarity existed across this large geographic area and (2) whether trends were related to the lake-specific characteristics of latitude, lake size, or time period the lake was monitored. Our database consisted of >140,000 individual Secchi observations from 3,251 lakes that we summarized per lake-year, resulting in 21,020 summer averages. Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we found approximately a 1% per year increase in water clarity (quantified as Secchi depth) for the entire population of lakes. On an individual lake basis, 7% of lakes showed increased water clarity and 4% showed decreased clarity. Trend direction and strength were related to latitude and median sample date. Lakes in the southern part of our study-region had lower average annual summer water clarity, more negative long-term trends, and greater inter-annual variability in water clarity compared to northern lakes. Increasing trends were strongest for lakes with median sample dates earlier in the period of record (1938–2012). Our ability to identify specific mechanisms for these trends is currently hampered by the lack of a large, multi-thematic database of variables that drive water clarity (e.g., climate, land use/cover). Our results demonstrate, however, that citizen science can provide the critical monitoring data needed to address environmental questions at large spatial and long temporal scales. Collaborations among citizens, research scientists, and government agencies may be important for developing the data sources and analytical tools necessary to move toward an understanding of the factors influencing macro-scale patterns such as those shown here for lake water clarity.

T1  - Influence of Molting and Starvation on Digestive Enzyme Activities and Energy Storage in Gammarus fossarum
AN  - 1520142599
AB  - Among the many biological responses studied in ecotoxicology, energy-based biomarkers such as digestive enzyme activities and energy reserves appear to be useful predictive tools for detecting physiological disturbances in organisms. However, the use of these biological responses as biomarkers could be limited by the effects of confounding factors (biotic and abiotic) and physiological processes, such as the reproductive cycle. Thus, the optimal use of these biomarkers will be facilitated by understanding the effects of these factors on the energy metabolism of the sentinel species being studied. We considered abiotic factors (temperature and conductivity) in a previous study, whereas the present study investigated the effects of gender, the female reproductive stage, and food availability on the digestive enzyme activities and energy storage of Gammarus fossarum. The results indicated that, during the female reproductive cycle, the activities of digestive enzymes (amylase, cellulase, and trypsin) decreased significantly, whereas the levels of reserves (proteins, lipids, and sugar) increased until the last premolt stage. Restricted food diets only led to decreased amylase activities in both sexes. Food starvation also induced a decrease in the energy outcomes in females, whereas there were no effects in males. In general, the biochemical (digestive enzyme activities) and physiological (energy reserves) responses were more stable in males than in females. These results support the use of males fed ad libitum to limit the effects of confounding factors when using these energy biomarkers in Gammarus fossarum during biomonitoring programs.

T1  - Alaska's Changing Arctic:&nbsp;Ecological Consequences for Tundra, Streams, and Lakes
AN  - 2134792640
AB  - In this edition of the Long Term Ecological Research Network series, editors John Hobbie and George Kling and 58 co-authors synthesize the findings from the NSF-funded Arctic LTER project based at Toolik Lake, Alaska, a site that has been active since the mid-1970s. The book presents research on the core issues of climate-change science in the treeless arctic region of Alaska. As a whole, it examines both terrestrial and freshwater-aquatic ecosystems, and their three typical habitats: tundra, streams, and lakes. The book provides a history of the Toolik Lake LTER site, and discusses its present condition and future outlook. It features contributions from top scientists from many fields, creating a multidisciplinary survey of the Alaskan arctic ecosystem. Chapter topics include glacial history, climatology, land-water interactions, mercury found in the Alaskan arctic, and the response of these habitats to environmental change. The final chapter predicts the consequences that arctic Alaska faces due to global warming and climate change, and discusses the future ecology of the LTER site in the region. Alaska's Changing Arctic is the definitive scientific survey of the past, present, and future of the ecology of the Alaskan arctic.

T1  - Still time for Ontario to pass environmental legislation
AN  - 1496366989
AB  - Ontario borders four of the five Great Lakes, meaning it has a huge stake in the health of these inland seas. The threats facing our lakes, however, seem to multiply by the day - everything from falling water levels to the potential invasion of voracious Asian carp, an event that could make the introduction of zebra mussels look like an ecological picnic by comparison. Efforts to take better care of the lakes, however, involve a tangle of jurisdictions, treaties, laws and regulations, with responsibility spread widely across the provincial government and no clear central authority. The Great Lakes Protection Act seeks to make greater sense of our efforts to help the lakes by better co-ordinating actions to protect water quality and quantity, prevent pollution, and restore and protect natural ecosystems. It's a "must-have" if we are going to have any chance of keeping one of our greatest natural assets - and the source of drinking water for millions of people - thriving in the face of major threats such as climate change, invasive species and a growing continent-wide thirst for water.

T1  - Impacts des Contaminants Inorganiques sur les Capacités Métaboliques des Anguilles Jaunes D'amérique et D'europe
AN  - 2812066100
AB  - Les anguilles d'Amérique (Anguilla rostrata) et d'Europe (Anguilla anguilla) ont vu leurs populations décliner de façon très importante depuis les années 1980. Comme pour d'autres facteurs (surpêche, obstacles à la migration, changements du climat et des courants marins), la contamination semble jouer un rôle dans les déclins observés. En particulier, des effets sur l'activité d'enzymes liées aux différentes capacités métaboliques peuvent ainsi se traduire par une influence sur la croissance, la capacité de nage, les capacités respiratoires, et l'accumulation de réserves énergétiques, et possiblement contribuer à compromettre leur migration et/ou leur reproduction dans la mer des Sargasses. Dans le cadre du projet IMMORTEEL, la présente étude avait pour but de déterminer si les contaminants inorganiques accumulés dans le foie et le muscle (Cd, Cu, Zn, Ag, As, Pb, Cr, Ni, Se et Hg) pouvaient affecter les capacités métaboliques des deux espèces d'anguilles au stade jaune. Les mesures d'activités d'enzymes du foie et du muscle associées aux capacités aérobies (citrate synthase, CS; cytochrome C oxydase, CCO), aux capacités anaérobies (lactate déshydrogénase, LDH), aux capacités glycolytiques (pyruvate kinase, PK) et au métabolisme des lipides (glucose-6-phosphate déshydrogénase, G6PDH) ont alors été faites. Dans le foie d'A. rostrata, les plus fortes corrélations obtenues indiquent que la PK et la CS sont liées positivement au Zn et au Pb respectivement, tandis que la G6PDH et la LDH sont principalement affectées négativement par l'Ag et le Ni respectivement. Au niveau du muscle, la PK, la CS et la CCO sont toutes affectées particulièrement par le Hg, même si seule la PK montre une corrélation positive. Du côté d'A. anguilla, la PK et la CS du foie sont toutes deux affectées par le Pb, mais de manière positive et négative respectivement, puis la LDH est liée négativement au Zn. Dans le muscle, la PK et la LDH montrent des corrélations négatives avec l'As et le Se respectivement, puis la CS et la CCO sont toutes deux principalement liées positivement à la contamination en Zn. Par ailleurs, les résultats indiquent aussi que la concentration en protéines semble être liée aux variations d'activités enzymatiques observées dans le foie et le muscle des deux espèces d'anguilles, mais jamais de façon systématique pour une enzyme ou une espèce donnée. Enfin, la masse est aussi fortement liée de façon positive aux capacités aérobies du muscle (CS et CCO), et ce pour les deux espèces d'anguilles. Les résultats indiquent donc que la plupart des contaminants inorganiques dosés ont des effets sur les capacités métaboliques des deux espèces.Alternate abstract:American (Anguilla rostrata) and European (Anguilla anguilla) eels have experienced severe population declines since the 1980s. Along with other factors (overfishing, turbines, dams and migration obstacles, climate and ocean sea currents changes), chemical contaminants may play a key role in the observed declines. Effects of contaminants on the activity of enzymes associated with specific metabolic capacities may influence growth, swimming capacity, respiratory capacities and energetic reserves accumulation of the eels, and ultimately compromise their migration and/or reproduction in the Sargasso Sea. As a part of the IMMORTEEL project, the present study aimed to determine whether inorganic contaminants (Cd, Cu, Zn, Ag, As, Pb, Cr, Ni, Se and Hg) accumulated in liver and muscle could have an effect on the metabolic capacities of both species in their yellow stage. Enzyme activity measurements were performed for aerobic capacities (citrate synthase, CS; cytochrome C oxidase, CCO), anaerobic capacities (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), glycolitic capacities (pyruvate kinase, PK), and lipid metabolism (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH). In liver of A. rostrata, the strongest correlations obtained indicate that PK and CS are positively related to Zn and Pb, respectively, while G6PDH and LDH are principally negatively related to Ag and Ni, respectively. In muscle, PK is positively correlated to Hg, while CS and CCO are negatively correlated to Hg. For A. anguilla, liver PK and CS are positively and negatively related to Pb, respectively, and LDH is negatively related to Zn. In the muscle, PK and LDH show negative correlations with As and Se, respectively, while CS and CCO are both positively correlated to Zn concentrations. Otherwise, results indicate that protein concentration seems to be linked to the enzyme activity variations observed in liver and muscle of both eel species, but not in a systematic way for a given enzyme or species. Finally, weight is also strongly associated to the aerobic capacities (CS and CCO) of both species. AU these results allow us to believe that most of the inorganic contaminants studied have effects on the metabolic capacities of both eel species.

T1  - Influence de la Physico-chimie du Milieu (pH, NH₄⁺, Ca²⁺) sur L'internalisation et la Toxicité du Platine et du Palladium Chez L'algue Verte: Chlamydomonas Reinhardfii
AN  - 2812066061
AB  - Les concentrations de platine et de palladium dans l'environnement ont considérablement augmenté dans les trente dernières années en raison des particules émises par les convertisseurs catalytiques des systèmes d'échappement des véhicules. Peu de données sont disponibles quant à la biodisponibilité et la toxicité de ces deux métaux. Pour évaluer la toxicité de ces deux éléments, l'algue verte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii a été exposée à plusieurs concentrations de Pd et de Pt. Pour évaluer l'influence de la spéciation du métal sur sa toxicité et son internalisation, trois différentes valeurs de pH (6,0, 7,0 et 8,0) ont été utilisées. Les concentrations nominales d'exposition étaient comprises entre 18 et 282 nM pour le palladium et entre 26 et 512 nM pour le platine; les concentrations expérimentales ont été mesurées par ICP-MS. La spéciation du palladium a été modélisée en utilisant Visual MINTEQ, mais celle du Pt n'a pu être estimée en raison de l'absence de données thermodynamiques fiables. La densité cellulaire a été déterminée à chaque 24 heures et a été utilisée comme paramètre pour l'évaluation de la toxicité. Aucun des deux métaux n'a eu d'incidence sur le rendement, mais un retard dans la croissance a été observé à mesure que les concentrations augmentaient. Pour le Pd, la croissance a été retardée de manière plus importante à pH 7 comparé à pH 6 et aucun délai n'a été constaté à pH 8 pour une même gamme de concentrations. Des résultats similaires ont été observés pour le Pt. Les CE50 déterminées ont confirmé une toxicité accrue à pH neutre. L'internalisation de ces métaux est fortement corrélée avec la concentration de métal mesurée dans le milieu de culture et change en fonction du pH. Pour évaluer l'influence de la complexation du Pd par l'ammoniac, des expériences ont été menées avec une concentration plus faible en ammonium, avec comme résultat une toxicité réduite. Étonnamment, une variation de la concentration de calcium dans le milieu de culture n'a pas eu d'effet sur la toxicité du palladium. Les concentrations environnementales de Pt et de Pd peuvent se rapprocher des CE50 calculées et l'émission continue de ces métaux dans l'environnement laisse présager une augmentation des concentrations dans l'eau qui pourraient nuire aux écosystèmes aquatiques dans un proche avenir.Alternate abstract:Platinum and palladium concentrations in the environ ment have increased considerably over the past 30 years, due to particles emitted by the catalytic converters in vehicle exhaust systems. Yet, little is known about the bioavailability and toxicity of these two metals. To assess the toxicity of these two elements towards aquatic organisms, the freshwater green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was exposed to various concentratidns of Pd and Pt. To explore the influence of metal speciation on uptake and toxicity, experiments were performed at pH 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0. Targeted total metal concentrations varied from 18 to 282 nM for palladium and from 26 to 512 nM for platinum; total metal concentrations were determined by ICP-MS. Palladium speciation was modeled using the Visual MINTEQ program, but speciation couldn't be estimated for Pt, due to the lack of reliable thermodynamic data. The algal density was monitored every 24 h and was used as a toxicity endpoint. Neither metal had an effect or' the yield, but both induced an increase in the lag phase as the exposure concentrations increased. For Pd, the lag phase was longer at pH 7 than at pH 6 whereas no effects were observed at pH 8 over the tested range of concentrations; similar results were obtained for Pt. The calculated ECso confirmed a higher toxicity at neutral pH than for the other tested pHs. The uptake of the two metals was strongly correlated with measured metal content of the exposure media and was influenced by pH. To investigate the influence of ammonia on Pd complexation, experiments were also performed in low ammonium media, which resulted in reduced toxicity. The effect of water hardness on Pd toxicity was also studied, without clear evidence of an influence on the algal response. Environmental concentrations of Pt and Pd can be near the calculated ECso values and the continued emissions of these two metals to the environ ment suggest that exceedances may happen more frequently in the future.

T1  - A predictive model for the antifouling efficacy of engineered microtopographies
AN  - 1847568013
AB  - We have developed a model, the Surface Energetics Attachment (SEA) model that relates the work of adhesion for an organism to the probability of attachment. The model was used to predict the attachment density of four organisms to a variety of topographies from data available in the literature. The results showed the model was capable of predicting relative attachment density to a high degree of accuracy (R2 = 0.83). Additionally, local effects of topographic configuration were identified and predicted by the model.    An additional tool, the radial distribution function, was applied to zoospores of Ulva linza attached to topographies. This analysis was combined with previously developed mapping techniques to help identify local topographic configuration effects on Ulva attachment that may by missed the SEA model analysis. The radial distribution function showed differences in Rmax and screening distance dependent on the location of the spore on the topography. Additionally, the contributory effects of a single spore extended only 20 μm from the reference which indicated an ideal size for the topography.   Topographies were characterized for their adhesion properties through Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements and contact angle measurements. The AFM measurements showed site dependence for the work of adhesion for a colloidal probe on a wetted topography as predicted by the SEA model. The contact angle measurements configuration dependence for static, advancing and receding contact angle measurements for DI water.    Bioassays with Ulva linza and Balanus amphitrite  showed good agreement with the SEA model predictions. A high throughput assay was developed to test the Ulva attachment and was successfully used to discriminate differences between 32 simultaneously tested patterns. A series of topographies ranging from 5 μm to 200 μm in size were evaluated for the barnacle cyprid. These were found to inhibit attachment in line with the model predictions. Additionally, tracking experiments showed disruption of the cyprid surface probing dependent on the size of the topography.

T1  - Closer to the ground: Environmental sociology of children
AN  - 1738989388
AB  - The negative impacts of human behavior on the natural environment are increasingly apparent, and while environmental education offers the hope that teaching and engaging young people will lead them on alternative paths in their interactions with the natural world that worthy goal has not come to fruition. Our environmentally significant behaviors as a society only continue to worsen. I suggest not only that we have not taken the time to understand children and their own child-centered understanding of the world, but more importantly that it is this very understanding that will reshape how we think about environmental education. To do this, I present an environmental sociology of children.   I orient this project within the tradition of American Pragmatism, allowing multiple methods and operationalized theories to be applied in tandem. I address three primary questions using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies, with a sample of 191 kids at a Title I public Montessori school in Northern Indiana. - What does “nature” mean to children aged 3 – 11? - What are these children’s attitudes towards nature? - What do environmental identities in kids, aged 7 – 11, look like? Key findings include: - Constructions of nature were often close to home, immediate, and experiential. - These kids hold strong pro-environmental attitudes, but how they make sense of these attitudes vary in meaningful ways. - Those kids with strong environmental identities made sense of their own and other people’s interactions with the natural world in two primary and often overlapping ways – giving moral standing to the natural world and/or applying the theory of evolution to make sense of human interaction with the natural world.   These findings point to the need to recognize the legitimacy of child-centered ways of knowing as pathways to engage youth and underscore the need for greater consideration and intentionality in the development of a nuanced pedagogy of human/nature interaction in environmental education. I conclude the dissertation with suggestions for improving environmental education.

T1  - Nuisance species: beyond the ecological perspective
AN  - 1652857132
AB  - 'Nuisance species' (or 'invasive' species) are often proposed to be the second most important concern in the context of the current biodiversity crisis. Despite increasing evidence that exotic species do not always become invasive, this perception is still common in the scientific community. This suggests that other issues are at stake in the concept of nuisance species rather than just the problems they raise, grounded mostly in ecological or economic arguments.              We retraced the evolution of pigeon representation in France through an extensive review of ancient texts related to pigeons and reviewed more than 240 source texts, dating from the seventh century to the 1990s. We completed these data with literature on human-animal relationships and animal conceptions in religious, philosophical, scientific, and political currents of thought that were representative of Western and, specifically, French tradition.              We used the heated debate over pigeons (Columba livia) as pests as a case study by analyzing the ecological, social, economic, and political relations regarding pigeons. Through a historical perspective of the debate about and understanding of pigeons, we propose a new and complementary explanation for the modern thinking of pigeons as a nuisance species, based on what we termed their socio-nature characteristics. In particular, we used social representations theory to highlight the issues of human identity construction at stake in the construction of pigeons as a nuisance species.              We invite the reader to consider the impact of such human self-definition on environmental stances, as it could constrain further developments or improvements of conservation perspectives.

T1  - Stage-specific transcriptomic analyses of reproductive tissue in the pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas
AN  - 1559962044
AB  - The Pacific oyster is an important aquaculture species which suffers from reduced larval survival related to variation in state of gonad maturation among broodstock used for larval production.  Gene expression was investigated as a potential indicator of reproductive stage.  Stage-specific libraries were created by RNA sequencing, which were used for testing and identification of stage-specific, differentially expressed genes.  Multiple factors related to the normalization and interpretation of gene expression data were queried, including the role of deadenylation of mRNA in developing oocytes.  A set of candidate biomarker genes were screened for their correlation with and ability to predict maturation stage in female oysters.  The results justify further development and use of expression data to identify maturation state.

T1  - Synergistic Effects of Toxic Elements on Heat Shock Proteins
AN  - 1552843991
AB  - Heat shock proteins show remarkable variations in their expression levels under a variety of toxic conditions. A research span expanded over five decades has revealed their molecular characterization, gene regulation, expression patterns, vast similarity in diverse groups, and broad range of functional capabilities. Their functions include protection and tolerance against cytotoxic conditions through their molecular chaperoning activity, maintaining cytoskeleton stability, and assisting in cell signaling. However, their role as biomarkers for monitoring the environmental risk assessment is controversial due to a number of conflicting, validating, and nonvalidating reports. The current knowledge regarding the interpretation of HSPs expression levels has been discussed in the present review. The candidature of heat shock proteins as biomarkers of toxicity is thus far unreliable due to synergistic effects of toxicants and other environmental factors. The adoption of heat shock proteins as "suit of biomarkers in a set of organisms" requires further investigation.

T1  - Population control to mitigate the spread of marine pests: insights from management of the Asian kelp Undaria pinnatifida and colonial ascidian Didemnum vexillum
AN  - 2287017482
AB  - The control of marine pest populations in transport hubs has the potential to contain or limit spread by minimizing the infection of vessels and other vectors. We draw on New Zealand experiences with eradication or population control attempts on two marine pests, the Asian kelp Undaria pinnatifida Harvey Suringar and the colonial ascidian Didemnum vexillum Kott, to evaluate the extent to which vector infection was mitigated by management efforts. For both species we compare two levels of effort: sustained control involving intensive regional-scale eradication programs, and shorter-duration less intensive efforts that we refer to as partial control. The mean monthly proportion of vessels infected by Undaria was ~1% in two regions where sustained control reduced densities in marine habitats to 1–5% of the pre-treatment population. By contrast, 39% of vessels were infected during a partial control effort, which was comparable to the proportion of vessels infected in four ports where Undaria populations were not managed. For Didemnum, a reduction of the population to < 0.1% of the pre-treatment level almost completely negated vessel infection, to the extent that few vessels were implicated in the further spread of Didemnum while sustained control was in place. By contrast, partial population control led to limited benefit in terms of vector risk reduction. More importantly, a cessation or reduction in population control efforts resulted in relatively rapid vessel re-infection. Both case studies illustrate that intensive control of marine pest populations can greatly reduce the infection of susceptible vectors, but achieving such an outcome requires an indefinite commitment of resources, and may be impractical for multiple pest species or multiple infested locations. Although slowing the spread of marine pests can lead to demonstrable benefits, for population control to have greater practicality and stakeholder support, there is a need for socially acceptable and affordable control tools that are effective across relatively large spatial scales.

T1  - Fish on the Move: Magazine of the Royal Ontario Museum
AN  - 1547840537
AB  - Fishes are often classified into warm-, cool-, and cold-water guilds depending on the temperatures in which they best survive and reproduce. The northern range-boundaries of many warm- and cool-water fish species lie within Ontario. Until recently, the areas north and east of Lake Superior and most of the northern half of the province were too cold for Smallmouth Bass, a warmwater species. In the past, many introductions of warm-water fish in northern lakes would have failed because colder temperatures limited the establishment of these species. With climate warming, the northern range-boundaries of Smallmouth Bass and other cooland warm-water fishes are expected to move north. My colleagues at the University of Toronto and I recently investigated this hypothesis using data from the ROM's fish collection database and surveys completed by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.

              
Freshwater ecosystems are believed to be particularly vulnerable to species introductions. The devastating effects of zebra mussels in Ontario's Lake St. Clair (so clearly illustrated in the Life in Crisis: Schad Gallery of Biodiversity at the ROM) are an example of the impacts introduced species can have. As fish species move toward more northerly latitudes they are introduced to new lakes and stream reaches. Range-expansion by populations of Smallmouth Bass, a predator that often feeds on small fish, is predicted to threaten thousands of populations of minnows. Smallmouth Bass is also known to compete for food with Lake Trout, a coldwater fish. In some lakes where Smallmouth Bass has been introduced. Lake Trout has changed its diet and begun feeding on less rewarding prey, which may very well reduce growth and reproduction.

              
The now irrefutable fact of climate warming has begun to facilitate the spread and establishment of many species into new areas, and the different impacts of these introductions on resident species and their ecosystems are still unclear in most cases. Climate warming has been and is expected to be most intense at higher latitudes and, according to the IPCC, the region around the Great Lakes is projected to warm 50 percent more than the global average. There's no doubt therefore that the ROM's collection will become increasingly important as we continue to investigate the impacts of climate change in Ontario and around the globe, o

T1  - Don't discount Asian carp threat
AN  - 1443688901
AB  - The discovery of two grass carp - one in April, the other in August - in the Grand River near Dunnville, close to Lake Erie - is giving federal and provincial biologists pause, and well it should. While both of the carp were determined to be sterile, and although they may not be as feared as two other varieties of this invasive species - the bighead carp and the jumping silver carp - this is no time for complacency.              Gord Miller, Ontario's environmental commissioner, said as much Oct. 11 as he released his annual report. In that report, he bemoaned the lack of a provincial action plan, and the attendant funding, to confront invasive species such as Asian carp and the emerald ash borer. Miller said it would be a "wise investment, potentially averting the risks and financial costs associated with invasive species that we have seen with previous introductions." The zebra mussel invasion of the Great Lakes is an illustration of that.

T1  - The effect of glyphosate-based herbicide on aquatic organisms - a case study
AN  - 1493423949
AB  - The non-selective, post-emergence herbicides based on glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine] are one of the most widely used pesticides in agriculture, urban areas and forestry. Although there has been documentation on the physical, chemical and toxicological properties of glyphosate, the aquatic toxicity of such formulations still requires assessment and evaluation. In the present study, we describe deliberate use of glyphosate-based herbicide in a bathing area of Lake Lednica (Wielkopolska, Poland) by unknown perpetrators in April, 2011. Glyphosate was detected using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in the water samples collected from the bathing area at a mean concentration of 0.09 mg dm-3. Aboveground parts of emerged macrophytes (Phragmites australis and Typha latifolia) covering the investigated area were completely withered. Studies of benthic macroinvertebrates revealed no significant differences in taxa number between event (13 taxa) and control (14 taxa) sites although differences in abundance of particular taxa were observed. Significantly lower numbers of Chironomidae (by 41%), Oligochaeta (by 43%), Vivipariae (by 75%), Hirudinae (by 75%), Asellus aquaticus (by 77%), Gammarus pulex (by 38%) and Dreissena polymorpha (by 42%) were found at the glyphosate-treated site. Furthermore, compared to the control, chironomids (Chironomidae) exposed to glyphosate were represented by specimens smaller in length while A. aquaticus only showed large adults. The ranges of glyphosate concentration in the tissues of sampled macroinvertebrates and Phragmites australis organs were 7.3-10.2 μg kg-1 and 16.2-24.7 μg kg-1, respectively. Our study indicates that glyphosate-based herbicides may have adverse effects on aquatic organisms including macroinvertebrates, thus their use in (or nearby) surface waters should be subject to strict limitation.

T1  - Cephalopods as Vectors of Harmful Algal Bloom Toxins in Marine Food Webs
AN  - 1536901455
AB  - Here we summarize the current knowledge on the transfer and accumulation of harmful algal bloom (HAB)-related toxins in cephalopods (octopods, cuttlefishes and squids). These mollusks have been reported to accumulate several HAB-toxins, namely domoic acid (DA, and its isomers), saxitoxin (and its derivatives) and palytoxin (and palytoxin-like compounds) and, therefore, act as HAB-toxin vectors in marine food webs. Coastal octopods and cuttlefishes store considerably high levels of DA (amnesic shellfish toxin) in several tissues, but mainly in the digestive gland (DG)-the primary site of digestive absorption and intracellular digestion. Studies on the sub-cellular partitioning of DA in the soluble and insoluble fractions showed that nearly all DA (92.6%) is found in the cytosol. This favors the trophic transfer of the toxins since cytosolic substances can be absorbed by predators with greater efficiency. The available information on the accumulation and tissue distribution of DA in squids (e.g., in stranded Humboldt squids, Dosidicus gigas) is scarcer than in other cephalopod groups. Regarding paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), these organisms accumulate them at the greatest extent in DG >> kidneys > stomach > branchial hearts > posterior salivary glands > gills. Palytoxins are among the most toxic molecules identified and stranded octopods revealed high contamination levels, with ovatoxin (a palytoxin analogue) reaching 971 μg kg-1 and palytoxin reaching 115 μg kg-1 (the regulatory limit for PlTXs is 30 μg kg-1 in shellfish). Although the impacts of HAB-toxins in cephalopod physiology are not as well understood as in fish species, similar effects are expected since they possess a complex nervous system and highly developed brain comparable to that of the vertebrates. Compared to bivalves, cephalopods represent a lower risk of shellfish poisoning in humans, since they are usually consumed eviscerated, with exception of traditional dishes from the Mediterranean area.

T1  - Brevibacillus laterosporus, a Pathogen of Invertebrates and a Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Species
AN  - 1523657853
AB  - Brevibacillus laterosporus, a bacterium characterized by the production of a unique canoe-shaped lamellar body attached to one side of the spore, is a natural inhabitant of water, soil and insects. Its biopesticidal potential has been reported against insects in different orders including Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and against nematodes and mollusks. In addition to its pathogenicity against invertebrates, different B. laterosporus strains show a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity including activity against phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi. A wide variety of molecules, including proteins and antibiotics, have been associated with the observed pathogenicity and mode of action. Before being considered as a biological control agent against plant pathogens, the antifungal and antibacterial properties of certain B. laterosporus strains have found medical interest, associated with the production of antibiotics with therapeutic effects. The recent whole genome sequencing of this species revealed its potential to produce polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and toxins. Another field of growing interest is the use of this bacterium for bioremediation of contaminated sites by exploiting its biodegradation properties. The aim of the present review is to gather and discuss all recent findings on this emerging entomopathogen, giving a wider picture of its complex and broad-spectrum biocontrol activity.

T1  - Development of Genomic Resources for a thraustochytrid Pathogen and Investigation of Temperature Influences on Gene Expression
AN  - 1433331893
AB  - Understanding how environmental changes influence the pathogenicity and virulence of infectious agents is critical for predicting epidemiological patterns of disease. Thraustochytrids, part of the larger taxonomic class Labyrinthulomycetes, contain several highly pathogenic species, including the hard clam pathogen quahog parasite unknown (QPX). QPX has been associated with large-scale mortality events along the northeastern coast of North America. Growth and physiology of QPX is temperature-dependent, and changes in local temperature profiles influence pathogenicity. In this study we characterize the partial genome of QPX and examine the influence of temperature on gene expression. Genes involved in several biological processes are differentially expressed upon temperature change, including those associated with altered growth and metabolism and virulence. The genomic and transcriptomic resources developed in this study provide a foundation for better understanding virulence, pathogenicity and life history of thraustochytrid pathogens.

T1  - Biosecurity:&nbsp;The Socio-Politics of Invasive Species and Infectious Diseases
AN  - 2135969425
AB  - Biosecurity is the assessment and management of potentially dangerous infectious diseases, quarantined pests, invasive (alien) species, living modified organisms, and biological weapons. It is a holistic concept of direct relevance to the sustainability of agriculture, food safety, and the protection of human populations (including bio-terrorism), the environment, and biodiversity. Biosecurity is a relatively new concept that has become increasingly prevalent in academic, policy and media circles, and needs a more comprehensive and inter-disciplinary approach to take into account mobility, globalisation and climate change. In this introductory volume, biosecurity is presented as a governance approach to a set of concerns that span the protection of indigenous biological organisms, agricultural systems and human health, from invasive pests and diseases. It describes the ways in which biosecurity is understood and theorized in different subject disciplines, including anthropology, political theory, ecology, geography and environmental management. It examines the different scientific and knowledge practices connected to biosecurity governance, including legal regimes, ecology, risk management and alternative knowledges. The geopolitics of biosecurity is considered in terms of health, biopolitics and trade governance at the global scale. Finally, biosecurity as an approach to actively secure the future is assessed in the context of future risk and uncertainties, such as globalization and climate change.

T1  - The Global Casino:&nbsp;An Introduction to Environmental Issues
AN  - 2134956620
AB  - The Global Casino is an introduction to environmental issues which deals both with the workings of the physical environment and the political, economic and social frameworks in which the issues occur. Using examples from all over the world, the book highlights the underlying causes behind environmental problems, the human actions which have made them issues, and the hopes for solutions. It is a book about the human impact on the environment and the ways in which the natural environment impacts human society. The fifth edition has been fully revised and updated throughout, with new case studies, figures, and online resources such as downloadable figures and tables from the text and multiple choice questions for students, accessible at: www.routledge.com/cw/middleton. New topics covered in extended boxed case studies include payment for environmental services, ocean acidification, biofuels in Brazil, waste reduction through industrial symbiosis, and the long-term impact of natural disasters on vulnerable groups. Other approaches and concepts covered for the first time in this new edition include traditional ecological knowledge, environmental justice, the 'resource curse', and urban biodiversity. Eighteen chapters on key issues follow three initial chapters which outline the background contexts of the physical and human environments and the concept of sustainable development. Each chapter provides historical context for key issues, outlines why they have arisen, and highlights areas of controversy and uncertainty to appraise how issues can be resolved both technically and in political and economic frameworks. Each chapter also contains an updated critical guide to further reading and websites, as well as discussion points and essay questions. The text can be read in its entirety or individual chapters adopted as standalone reading. The Global Casino is an essential resource for students of the environment, geography, earth sciences and development studies. It provides comprehensive and inspirational coverage of all the major global environmental issues of the day in a style that is clear and critical.

T1  - Ecosystem Services for Sustainability
AN  - 2373492941
AB  - Ecosystem Services for Sustainability covers the many benefits provided by things we too often take for granted: the aquifers and glaciers that provide our drinking water, the forests and oceans that store excess carbon dioxide, the microscopic organisms that enrich the soil in which we grow our food, and the insects that play a crucial role in maintaining the global food supply. A team of well-known authors, writing for the nonexpert reader, looks at how nature provides for humankind, and how humankind can, in return, protect valuable and limited natural resources. The authors also explore practical ways of managing ecosystem services and integrating them into our global economy.

T1  - Relative Importance of Social Status and Physiological Need in Determining Leadership in a Social Forager
AN  - 1351913079
AB  - Group decisions on the timing of mutually exclusive activities pose a dilemma: monopolized decision-making by a single leader compromises the optimal timing of activities by the others, while independent decision-making by all group members undermines group coherence. Theory suggests that initiation of foraging should be determined by physiological demand in social foragers, thereby resolving the dilemma of group coordination. However, empirical support is scant, perhaps because intrinsic qualities predisposing individuals to leadership (social status, experience or personality), or their interactions with satiation level, have seldom been simultaneously considered. Here, we examine which females initiated foraging in eider (Somateria mollissima) brood-rearing coalitions, characterized by female dominance hierarchies and potentially large individual differences in energy requirements due to strenuous breeding effort. Several physiological and social factors, except for female breeding experience and boldness towards predators, explained foraging initiation. Initiators spent a larger proportion of time submerged during foraging bouts, had poorer body condition and smaller structural size, but they were also aggressive and occupied central positions. Initiation probability also declined with female group size as expected given random assignment of initiators. However, the relative importance of physiological predictors of leadership propensity (active foraging time, body condition, structural size) exceeded those of social predictors (aggressiveness, spatial position) by an order of magnitude. These results confirm recent theoretical work suggesting that ‘leading according to need’ is an evolutionary viable strategy regardless of group heterogeneity or underlying dominance structure.

T1  - Perceptions of ecological risk associated with introduced marine species in marine protected areas
AN  - 2287018715
AB  - The perception of ecological risks (impact and acceptability) associated with introduced marine species (IMS), what demographic variables influence those perceptions, respondent’s knowledge of IMS, and people’s support for controlling introduced marine species impacts on the marine environment was explored at three locations in Western Australia: Ningaloo Reef Marine Park, Rottnest Island Marine Reserve, and Hamelin Bay. Recognition that introduced marine species are an issue at state, national and international levels exists; yet often marine protected area management plans do not reflect this recognition. Therefore, we hypothesise that there is a lack of translation of concern regarding introduced marine species as a risk into tactical objectives within marine protected area management plans. This may be due to low stakeholder perceptions of the risk posed by introduced marine species. Survey respondents had a high level (89%) of self-rated awareness of introduced marine species and they also indicated (93%) a willingness to support management interventions to prevent, or control the spread of introduced marine species in Western Australia. Our results also indicate that gender (males) and age (18–45 age group) influenced respondents’ perception of risk (impact) of IMS, yet no examined demographic variables influenced respondents acceptability of risk. Furthermore, knowledge of introduced marine species, education level, and income variables did not influence respondents’ perception of risk (impact or acceptability). Understanding demographic characteristics that influence participants perceptions related to introduced marine species can be useful for targeted, educational initiatives to reduce the likelihood of IMS incursions. This begins to smooth the way for management to proactively develop and implement policies that are necessary to more fully protect the Western Australian marine environment.

T1  - Size-selective predation of the catfish Pimelodus pintado (Siluriformes: Pimelodidae) on the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei (Bivalvia: Mytilidae)
AN  - 1323569578
AB  - This paper describes the size-selective predation on Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857) by Pimelodus pintado (Azpelicueta, Lundberg & Loureiro, 2008) from the time it arrived at the Mirim Lagoon basin (2005). Sampling was carried out using bottom trawl in depths of 3-6 m, from January to November 2005, and from October to November 2008. Pimelodus pintado began to prey upon L. fortunei soon after its arrival (austral spring of 2005). On the spring of 2008, L. fortunei was found to be the most important food item of P. pintado. The variation in length of the mussels (0.7-3.2 cm, with a mode of 1.3 cm) indicates that the species is now fully established in the system. Our data indicates that large individuals of P. pintado incorporate more mussels in their diets than small individuals. However, regardless of their size, P. pintado individuals predate only on small (<1.4 cm) representatives of L. fortunei. This prey size corresponds to a phase when the mussel is more mobile and readily available for fish. Larger, more aggregated prey groups that are attached to hard substrates are avoided by fish predators.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Effects of Short-Term Exposure to Municipal Wastewater Effluent on Signalling Pathways in the Liver of Fish
AN  - 2812064795
AB  - Characterization of Montreal municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) has identified the presence of pharmaceuticals and persona} care products (PPCP), alkyphenols (AP), polychlminated biphenyls (PCB), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and heavy metals. MWWE contains mixtures of xenobiotics that have been shown to disrupt normal metabolic and cellular functions.Previous studies have shown that fish exposed to MWWE have resulted in altered cellular signaling in the testis. These processes are facilitated by transmembrane proteins called connexins (Cx) which form gap junctions (GJ). GJ allow the passage of small molecules between neighbouring cells, called gap junction intercellular signaling (GJIC). Brook trout exposed to MWWE for 4 and 12 weeks showed altered testicular Cx levels at both ti me points. At 4 weeks there was a significant increase in both Cx43 and Cx31. At 12 weeks a decrease in Cx31 and an increase in Cx43 and Cx43.4 was observed. The presence of xenobiotics has been shown to target and disrupt Cx mRNA levels resulting in altered cellular functions. Similar results were reported in Spottail shiners living within the effluent plume of MWWE. Shiners displayed altered testicular Cx levels resulting in delayed spermatogenesis, increased vitellogenin levels, intersex characteristics and decreased sperm motility. MWWE has been shown to target Cxs in the testis causing an alteration in key signaling pathways. lnterestingly, few studies have examined the effects of MWWE on cellular signaling in the liver considering the important role it plays in xenobiotic metabolism.Xenobiotics can accumulate in the li ver if the complex signaling required to carry out the detoxification process is disrupted. GJIC plays an important role in the regulation of normal homeostatic processes in the liver including xenobiotic metabolism, bile secretion and glycogenolysis. Fish exposed to MWWE have demonstrated altered Cx expression levels and cellular signaling in the testis, it can be hypothesized that a similar disruption of GJIC could occur in the liver.There are presently no studies that have examined the effects of MWWE on the liver and currently only one Cx has been identified in the Iiver of fish, Cx43 in the zebrafish. ln the present study two Cxs were identified in the li ver of the brook trout, Cx43 and Cx30. When compared to mammalian Cxs, brook trout Cx43 was partially homologous to GJAl in the mouse and rat. Brook trout Cx30 shared sorne homology to mouse GJB6 and human Cx26. This is the first report of Cx30 in the liver of fish.After exposing brook trout for 12 weeks to MWWE, a large increase in Cx30 mRNA levels was observed at the two highest effluent concentrations. Similar results have been previously repmted in the testis and were shown to disrupt normal GJIC. There were no changes to Cx43 levels suggesting either individual contaminants targeting Cx43 were not present or the exposure period was too short for accumulation to occur.To further investigate the effects of MWWE on key signaling pathways in the liver, juvenile fathead minnow were exposed to 20 % MWWE for 21 days. This study aimed to identify key signaling pathways affected by toxicants contained within the effluent mixture. Using a 15 208 eDNA microarray and pathway analysis software, three groups of genes, organized by function, were identified as being altered suggesting effects on various signaling pathways.

T1  - Assessing the Nitrogen and Phosphorus Loading in the Alabama (USA) River Basin Using PLOAD Model
AN  - 1400180275
AB  - Pollutant loadings in two watersheds, Mulberry and Catoma were assessed using the pollutant loading (PLOAD) model and model results were compared with those obtained from field sampling followed by laboratory analysis. The PLOAD model was used to determine water pollutants including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), orthophosphate (PO43-), nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) in two watersheds, Mulberry and Catoma that are part of the Alabama River Basin. Results revealed that both Mulberry and Catoma watersheds had TN and TP values that exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits set for rivers and streams. The TN and TP values were in the range of hypertrophic for lakes, and eutrophic for rivers. The PLOAD model results were in agreement with analytical results. We conclude that PLOAD is a valid model for determining pollutant loading in watersheds and provides a relatively faster and cheaper method of assessing impairment of watershed bodies compared to conventional methods.

T1  - The Biology and Ecology of Tintinnid Ciliates:&nbsp;Models for Marine Plankton
AN  - 2130933994
AB  - Planktonic protists both produce and consume most of the primary production in the world ocean. They not only play key roles in the oceans but also represent an astounding amount of diversity: ecological morphological and genetic. However, for most taxa their ecology, morphology, phylogeny and biogeography are either poorly known or appear to be largely unrelated to one another; this hinders our understanding of their biology as well as interpretation of emerging genetic data. Tintinnid ciliates represent a singular exception. Compared to nearly all other groups of planktonic protists, there is a very substantial and relatively detailed literature (both modern and historical) on tintinnids. This volume synthesizes knowledge concerning a wide variety of topics ranging from anatomy and systematics, physiology, behavior, ecology (including ecological roles, predators, parasites, biogeography, and cysts) to fossil history. It will appeal to an audience ranging from advanced undergraduates to researchers in the fields of Oceanography, Marine Biology and Microbial Ecology.

John Dolan 
has worked on plankton ecology for over 25 years in systems ranging from eutrophic estuaries to the oligotrophic South Pacific. His research subjects are plankton protists, especially ciliates and dinoflagellates and research topics are biodiversity, species packing, and the relationships of form and function. 


David Montagnes 
is an aquatic ecologist. He combines modelling, laboratory, and field studies investigations into the ecophysiology and behaviour of protists- aquatic taxa forming a rich assemblage and occupying environmentally important niches. His research themes include the flow of energy and biomass in ecosystems and how abiotic and biotic properties and anthropogenic perturbations alter individuals, populations, and ecosystems. 


Sabine Agatha 
is a ciliate taxonomist. She has spent over 20 years describing and classifying ciliates mostly from marine habitats by combining morphologic and genetic approaches. The biodiversity, evolution, and biogeography of ciliates are her main research topics.

  


Wayne Coats 
is a recently retired protistologist. His research encompasses ecology, morphology, life history, and taxonomy of dinoflagellates and ciliates. Parasitism and mixotrophy are featured themes of his work.

  


Diane Stoecker 
is a biological oceanographer. Her laboratory and field projects focus on microzooplankton and their grazing on phytoplankton and role as prey for copepods and other mesozooplankton. Plastid retention and mixotrophy in ciliates and dinoflagellates and their effects on population dynamics and trophic transfer are other favorite research topics.

T1  - Dispersal Ecology and Evolution
AN  - 2132026400
AB  - Now that so many ecosystems face rapid and major environmental change, the ability of species to respond to these changes by dispersing or moving between different patches of habitat can be crucial to ensuring their survival. Understanding dispersal has become key to understanding how populations may persist. Dispersal Ecology and Evolution provides a timely and wide-ranging overview of the fast expanding field of dispersal ecology, incorporating the very latest research. The causes, mechanisms, and consequences of dispersal at the individual, population, species, and community levels are considered. Perspectives and insights are offered from the fields of evolution, behavioural ecology, conservation biology, and genetics. Throughout the book theoretical approaches are combined withempirical data, and care has been taken to include examples from as wide a range of species as possible - both plant and animal.

T1  - Patterns of Deep-Sea Genetic Connectivity in the New Zealand Region: Implications for Management of Benthic Ecosystems
AN  - 1326746457
AB  - Patterns of genetic connectivity are increasingly considered in the design of marine protected areas (MPAs) in both shallow and deep water. In the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), deep-sea communities at upper bathyal depths (<2000 m) are vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbance from fishing and potential mining operations. Currently, patterns of genetic connectivity among deep-sea populations throughout New Zealand’s EEZ are not well understood. Using the mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase I and 16S rRNA genes as genetic markers, this study aimed to elucidate patterns of genetic connectivity among populations of two common benthic invertebrates with contrasting life history strategies. Populations of the squat lobster Munida gracilis and the polychaete Hyalinoecia longibranchiata were sampled from continental slope, seamount, and offshore rise habitats on the Chatham Rise, Hikurangi Margin, and Challenger Plateau. For the polychaete, significant population structure was detected among distinct populations on the Chatham Rise, the Hikurangi Margin, and the Challenger Plateau. Significant genetic differences existed between slope and seamount populations on the Hikurangi Margin, as did evidence of population differentiation between the northeast and southwest parts of the Chatham Rise. In contrast, no significant population structure was detected across the study area for the squat lobster. Patterns of genetic connectivity in Hyalinoecia longibranchiata are likely influenced by a number of factors including current regimes that operate on varying spatial and temporal scales to produce potential barriers to dispersal. The striking difference in population structure between species can be attributed to differences in life history strategies. The results of this study are discussed in the context of existing conservation areas that are intended to manage anthropogenic threats to deep-sea benthic communities in the New Zealand region.

T1  - Wetland Environments:&nbsp;A Global Perspective
AN  - 2140996165
AB  - Wetlands - swamp, marsh, bayou, tundra and bog - are places that are rarely visited and often misunderstood but they have, in fact, conspicuous roles in the physical, biological and cultural geography of the world.  They are intrinsically beautiful environments where one may see the natural and essential values in the interaction of water, soil, vegetation, wildlife, and humans.  Wetlands occur at the confluence of unique terrestrial, hydrological and climatic conditions that give rise to some of the most biodiverse regions of the world.  They also play vital roles in the cycling and storage of key nutrients, materials and energy through the Earth?s system. 
A complete study of wetland environments requires the assessment of their physical and biological attributes, properties and functions of these ecosystems, and the economic, political and social aspects that mediate their use globally.  A systems approach is taken throughout this book which emphasizes the interactions between these elements of wetland ecosystems.  Moreover, selected case studies from across the world are used to illustrate wetland characteristics and circumstances.  
This book is intended to foster a greater awareness and appreciation of wetlands, promote a culture of conservation and wise management, and spread the knowledge that wetlands are important, indeed crucial, elements of the global environment.  Our attempts to understand, manage and enhance wetlands in the twenty-first century are part of the larger effort to maintain a sustainable Earth. 

Readership: Undergraduate and graduate students worldwide studying wetland environments, as well as researchers and applied environmental scientists involved in wetland ecology and conservation.Wetlands - swamp, marsh, bayou, tundra and bog - are places that are rarely visited and often misunderstood but they have, in fact, conspicuous roles in the physical, biological and cultural geography of the world.  They are intrinsically beautiful environments where one may see the natural and essential values in the interaction of water, soil, vegetation, wildlife, and humans.  Wetlands occur at the confluence of unique terrestrial, hydrological and climatic conditions that give rise to some of the most biodiverse regions of the world.  They also play vital roles in the cycling and storage of key nutrients, materials and energy through the Earth's system.

T1  - Handbook of Environmental Degradation of Materials
AN  - 2131203503
AB  - Nothing stays the same for ever. The environmental degradation and corrosion of materials is inevitable and affects most aspects of life. In industrial settings, this inescapable fact has very significant financial, safety and environmental implications. The Handbook of Environmental Degradation of Materials explains how to measure, analyse, and control environmental degradation for a wide range of industrial materials including metals, polymers, ceramics, concrete, wood and textiles exposed to environmental factors such as weather, seawater, and fire. Divided into sections which deal with analysis, types of degradation, protection and surface engineering respectively, the reader is introduced to the wide variety of environmental effects and what can be done to control them. The expert contributors to this book provide a wealth of insider knowledge and engineering knowhow, complementing their explanations and advice with Case Studies from areas such as pipelines, tankers, packaging and chemical processing equipment ensures that the reader understands the practical measures that can be put in place to save money, lives and the environment The HandbookOCOs broad scope introduces the reader to the effects of environmental degradation on a wide range of materials, including metals, plastics, concrete, wood and textiles.For each type of material, the book describes the kind of degradation that effects it and how best to protect it.Case Studies show how organizations from small consulting firms to corporate giants design and manufacture products that are more resistant to environmental effects."

T1  - Modelling the Arrival of Invasive Organisms via the International Marine Shipping Network: A Khapra Beetle Study
AN  - 1326545739
AB  - Species can sometimes spread significant distances beyond their natural dispersal ability by anthropogenic means. International shipping routes and the transport of shipping containers, in particular are a commonly recognised pathway for the introduction of invasive species. Species can gain access to a shipping container and remain inside, hidden and undetected for long periods. Currently, government biosecurity agencies charged with intercepting and removing these invasive species when they arrive to a county’s border only assess the most immediate point of loading in evaluating a shipping container’s risk profile. However, an invasive species could have infested a container previous to this point and travelled undetected before arriving at the border. To assess arrival risk for an invasive species requires analysing the international shipping network in order to identify the most likely source countries and the domestic ports of entry where the species is likely to arrive. We analysed an international shipping network and generated pathway simulations using a first-order Markov chain model to identify possible source ports and countries for the arrival of Khapra beetle (Trogoderma granarium) to Australia. We found Kaohsiung (Taiwan) and Busan (Republic of Korea) to be the most likely sources for Khapra beetle arrival, while the port of Melbourne was the most likely point of entry to Australia. Sensitivity analysis revealed significant stability in the rankings of foreign and Australian ports. This methodology provides a reliable modelling tool to identify and rank possible sources for an invasive species that could arrive at some time in the future. Such model outputs can be used by biosecurity agencies concerned with inspecting incoming shipping containers and wishing to optimise their inspection protocols.

T1  - Ecological Restoration and Environmental Change:&nbsp;Renewing Damaged Ecosystems
AN  - 2131427304
AB  - What is a natural habitat? Who can define what is natural when species and ecosystems constantly change over time, with or without human intervention? When a polluted river or degraded landscape is restored from its damaged state, what is the appropriate outcome? With climate change now threatening greater disruption to the stability of ecosystems, how should restoration ecologists respond? Ecological Restoration and Environmental Change addresses and challenges some of these issues which question the core values of the science and practice of restoration ecology. It analyzes the paradox arising from the desire to produce ecological restorations that fit within an historical ecological context, produce positive environmental benefits and also result in landscapes with social meaning. Traditionally restorationists often felt that by producing restorations that matched historic ecosystems they were following nature's plans and human agency played only a small part in restoration. But the author shows that in reality the process of restoration has always been defined by human choices. He examines the development of restoration practice, especially in North America, Europe and Australia, in order to describe different models of restoration with respect to balancing ecological benefit and cultural value. He develops ways to balance more actively these differing areas of concern while planning restorations. The book debates in detail how coming global climate change and the development of novel ecosystems will force us to ask new questions about what we mean by good ecological restoration. When the environment is constantly shifting, restoration to maintain biodiversity, local species, and ecosystem functions becomes even more challenging. It is likely that in the future ecological restoration will become a never-ending, continuously evolving process.

"We can stop their spread by cleaning boats and equipment of visible debris, draining water from all conceivable places (including bilge, buckets, ballast water and wells) and letting boats and equipment dry for 30 days before entering a new body of water" says Crystal Klym, Program Manager for the Central Kootenay Invasive Plant Committee (CKIPC). "These simple acts can protect our waters."

T1  - Environmental Archaeology
AN  - 2132091080
AB  - One of the most significant developments in archaeology in recent years is the emergence of its environmental branch: the study of humans' interactions with their natural surroundings over long periods and of organic remains instead of the ceramic, lithic and architectural elements generally associated with sites. With the current attention paid to human responsibility for environmental change, this innovative field is recognized by scientists, conservation and heritage managers, and policymakers worldwide. 
In this context comes 

Environmental Archaeology by Elizabeth Reitz and Myra Shackley, updating the seminal 1981 text 
Environmental Archaeology by Myra Shackley.  Rigorously detailed yet concise and accessible, this volume surveys the complex and technical field of environmental archaeology for researchers interested in the causes, consequences, and potential future impact of environmental change from the perspective of archaeology. Its coverage acknowledges the multiple disciplines involved in the field, expanding the possibilities for using environmental data from archaeological sites in enriching related disciplines and improving communication among them. Introductory chapters explain the processes involved in the formation of sites, introduce research designs and field methods and walk the reader through biological classifications before focusing on the various levels of biotic and abiotic materials found at sites, including: 
 
Sediments and soils. 
Viruses, bacteria, archaea, protists and fungi. 
Bryophytes and vascular plants. 
Wood, charcoal, stems, leaves and roots. 
Spores, pollen and other microbotanical remains. 
Arthropods, molluscs, echinoderms and vertebrates.  
Stable isotopes, elements and biomolecules.  
The updated 
Environmental Archaeology is a major addition to the resource library of archaeologists,environmentalists, historians, researchers, policymakers--anyone involved in studying, managing, or preserving archaeological sites.First book to enable readers to learn about the wide range of materials and methods in environmental archaeology Helps to evaluate and discriminate among methods Continues in the tradition of the first edition, published by Plenum, while also bringing in advances and updates in the methodology of the field itself

T1  - First Evidence of Immunomodulation in Bivalves under Seawater Acidification and Increased Temperature
AN  - 1340444603
AB  - Water acidification, temperature increases and changes in seawater salinity are predicted to occur in the near future. In such a global climate change (GCC) scenario, there is growing concern for the health status of both wild and farmed organisms. Bivalve molluscs, an important component of coastal marine ecosystems, are at risk. At the immunological level, the ability of an organism to maintain its immunosurveillance unaltered under adverse environmental conditions may enhance its survival capability. To our knowledge, only a few studies have investigated the effects of changing environmental parameters (as predicted in a GCC scenario) on the immune responses of bivalves. In the present study, the effects of both decreased pH values and increased temperature on the important immune parameters of two bivalve species were evaluated for the first time. The clam Chamelea gallina and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, widespread along the coast of the Northwestern Adriatic Sea, were chosen as model organisms. Bivalves were exposed for 7 days to three pH values (8.1, 7.7 and 7.4) at two temperatures (22 and 28°C). Three independent experiments were carried out at salinities of 28, 34 and 40 PSU. The total haemocyte count, Neutral Red uptake, haemolymph lysozyme activity and total protein levels were measured. The results obtained demonstrated that tested experimental conditions affected significantly most of the immune parameters measured in bivalves, even if the variation pattern of haemocyte responses was not always linear. Between the two species, C. gallina appeared more vulnerable to changing pH and temperature than M. galloprovincialis. Overall, this study demonstrated that climate changes can strongly affect haemocyte functionality in bivalves. However, further studies are needed to clarify better the mechanisms of action of changing environmental parameters, both individually and in combination, on bivalve haemocytes.

T1  - Suivi temporel des effets d'un déversement de mazout sur la communauté benthique de la zone portuaire de parry sound
TT  - Temporal Monitoring of the Effects of an Oil Spill on the Benthic Community of the Port Area of Parry Sound
AN  - 2812053714
AB  - Cette étude avait pour but d'évaluer les impacts chroniques causés par un déversement de mazout, survenu en 1950, sur la communauté benthique de la zone portuaire de Parry Sound en Ontario. Pour ce faire, les communautés benthiques échantillonnées au site contaminé et au site de référence, en 1973 et 2009, ont été comparées ainsi que les déformations au niveau des pièces buccales des larves de l'insecte Chironomus cucini (Diptera; Chironomidae) provenant de ces deux époques. Ces comparaisons ont révélé qu'il n'y avait pas de différence dans l'abondance des communautés de 1973 et 2009, sauf pour la famille des Tubificidae, et que les déformations chez les Chironomus cucini ont diminué depuis 1973, retrouvant ainsi un pourcentage d'individus déformés équivalent au site de référence. De plus, la composition de la famille des Chironomidae a été suivie dans le temps à l'aide de capsules céphaliques anciennes prélevées d'une carotte de sédiment, montrant que l'abondance des Tanytarsini et des Chironomini étaient moins élevées dans les strates contaminées par les huiles, mais que celle des Chironomus était plus élevée suite au déversement. Afin d'identifier la cause des changements temporels, nous avons mesuré la concentration des métaux dans les larves de C. cucini et les sédiments de la zone portuaire et d'un site de référence, ainsi que la concentration des huiles et graisses dans une carotte de sédiments de la zone du déversement. L'analyse des métaux nous a permis de constater que la concentration de cadmium chez les larves de la station 1 était significativement plus élevée qu'à la station de référence alors que la mesure de concentration des huiles et graisses nous a indiqué que les sédiments de 3,5 à 5,5 cm de profondeur présentaient de fortes concentrations d'huiles et graisses. Malgré le fait que l'huile est toujours présente dans les sédiments, nos données suggèrent que la communauté benthique de la zone portuaire de Parry Sound démontre des paramètres de population similaires aux populations références, probablement dû aux sédiments contaminés maintenant enfouis en dehors de la zone habitée par la plupart des invertébrés benthiques qui y habitent.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerThe purpose of this study was to assess the chronic impacts caused by a fuel oil spill, which occurred in 1950, on the benthic community of the port area of Parry Sound in Ontario. To do this, the benthic communities sampled at the contaminated site and at the reference site, in 1973 and 2009, were compared as well as the deformations in the mouthparts of the larvae of the insect Chironomus cucini (Diptera; Chironomidae) from these two eras. These comparisons revealed that there was no difference in the abundance of the communities of 1973 and 2009, except for the family Tubificidae, and that deformities in Chironomus cucini have decreased since 1973, thus recovering a percentage of deformed individuals equivalent to the reference site. In addition, the composition of the Chironomidae family was followed over time using ancient head capsules taken from a sediment core, showing that the abundance of Tanytarsini and Chironomini were lower in strata contaminated with oils, but that Chironomus oil was higher following the spill. In order to identify the cause of the temporal changes, we measured the concentration of metals in C. cucini larvae and sediments from the port area and a reference site, as well as the concentration of oils and fats in a carrot sediment from the spill area. The analysis of metals allowed us to observe that the concentration of cadmium in the larvae of station 1 was significantly higher than at the reference station, while the measurement of the concentration of oils and greases indicated to us that the sediments of 3.5 to 5.5 cm deep had high concentrations of oils and greases. Despite the fact that oil is still present in the sediments, our data suggest that the benthic community in the port area of Parry Sound exhibits similar population parameters to reference populations, likely due to contaminated sediments now buried outside the area. inhabited by most of the benthic invertebrates that live there.

T1  - Findings on American Shad and Striped Bass in the Hudson River Estuary: A Fish Community Study of the Long‐Term Effects of Local Hydrology and Regional Climate Change
AN  - 2290342495
AB  - It has been hypothesized that climate change is an underlying factor in determining fish abundances in the Hudson River estuary (HRE). To study the effects of hydrology and climate on the HRE fish community, we applied multivariate statistical methods to data on 20 species–life history stages collected from 1974 to 2005. We confirm that the HRE fish community has changed over this period. These changes are correlated with local hydrology (freshwater flow and water temperature) and regional climate (the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation [AMO] and North Atlantic Oscillation). We found that the abundances of striped bass Morone saxatilis larval stages are positively correlated with high freshwater flows and those of juvenile American shad Alosa sapidissima negatively correlated with the AMO or warmer sea surface temperatures. Our findings suggest that climate‐related variability affects HRE juvenile shad abundances and that management strategies for this declining species should include the implications of climate change.Received March 19, 2011; accepted January 10, 2012

T1  - Grace Before the Fall
AN  - 1924690733
AB  - Grace Before the Fall is an annotated novel that follows a flaneuse on her journey toward love and social activism. It is set in a pre-9/11 New York City, during a week in the summer of 1980.   Geri Lipschultz, in her critical introduction, confronts both the instability and the virtual death of a text (drawing on Robert Scholes and Gayatri Spivak), as well as its revival in the hands of a contemporary reader. Lipschultz positions herself as a new reader in her revision/revival/revitalization of an old text—whose title, contents, and structure have been altered from their original construction thirty years past. She documents her course of revision, which begins with a rupture, itself a consequence of her impulse to investigate the etymology of selected words. Part of her work is an interrogation of the nature of revision itself, which might boil down to the adage offered by Heraclitus: You cannot step into the same river twice.   Lipschultz observes that her novel's initial modernist influences, namely Joyce and Nabokov, have been decentered by the ethos of the postcolonial/postmodern novel, given her changing reading preferences. Her introduction invokes both a personal and a civic history. It introduces the reader not only to the text but also to a paratext that resembles storytelling at times, offering knowledge gleaned only after the fact—for example the way AIDS was ravaging New York without its having a name—and investigates how that retrospective knowledge positions itself for any reader. The revisions within the text, she writes, have provided portal-like openings for character and setting, much as do architectural renovations. The paratext offers historiographic, geographic, and etymological asides—and memoir—whose purpose is to document the passage of time and the metamorphosis of a city. Lipschultz paints these changes with nostalgia and a sense of loss.   She argues that the annotations are not essential. They are there at the reader's discretion—placed as endnotes—as the novel, now situated within a magical realist context, articulates its theme of love and nature in conflict with the powers that be.

T1  - Dinámica espacio-temporal de 13 especies de peces nativos en un ecotono lacustre-fluvial de la Cuenca del Río Valdivia (Chile)/Spatio-temporal dynamics of 13 species of native fish in a lake - river ecotone in the Valdivia River Basin (Chile)
AN  - 1347411284
AB  - The transitional ecotones between lakes and rivers have received less attention than those of terrestrial ecosystems and can meet particular characteristics of great importance for freshwater biodiversity conservation. In order to evaluate this, we studied the spatio-temporal dynamics of the abundances and body sizes of the populations of 13 species of Chilean native fishes, in the ecotonal area Riñihue Lake - San Pedro river, located in the Valdivia river basin (Chile). Thirty five sites were sampled monthly, located in three hydromorphological zones of the study area (number of sites by area: M1 = 9, M2 = 17 M3 = 9). The results of this study show the presence of a dynamic ecotone both spatially and temporally, supporting the hypothesis that these transitional zones have special characteristics that must be taken into account for conservation of biodiversity.

T1  - Acquisition, Concentration, and Retention of Toxoplasma gondii Oocysts From Seawater by Marine Snails
AN  - 1322035688
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan parasite that has a worldwide distribution. The prevalence of T. gondii  infection in southern sea otters approaches 80% in some areas of the California coast, and causes significant sea otter mortality. Sea otters likely acquire the infection by ingestion of oocysts that are transported to the sea in watersheds. The objective of this study was to measure the acquisition, concentration, and retention of T. gondii oocysts by marine snails upon which sea otters prey. Trochid marine snails were experimentally exposed to T. gondii oocysts and microscopy was used to enumerate oocysts in tissue samples and feces from the exposed snails. The snails acquired oocysts, concentrated them, and retained them for up to ten days post-exposure. No naturally-acquired oocysts were detected in field-collected snails. These results suggest that marine snails might play an important role in the transmission of T. gondii to sea otters.

T1  - Political and Economic Interactions in the Hinterland of the Mapungubwe Polity, c. AD 1200-1300, South Africa
AN  - 1283133905
AB  - The focus of this research is on the archaeological site known as Mutamba, situated on the northern slopes of the Soutpansberg, South Africa. The site was occupied during the 13th-century, a period during which northern South Africa, southern Zimbabwe, and eastern Botswana saw an increase in social complexity. In the heartland of the Mapungubwe polity, this process is characterized by the centralization of political, social and ritual power and authority by the elite members of society. Prior to this research, the communities that occupied the hinterland of Mapungubwe were cast as passive participants in this metanarrative. This dissertation critiques the assumption of dominance based solely on differences of complexity.    The extent of Mapungubwe dominance is mostly seen in the distribution of similar ceramic design over the region. This view, however, inherently assumes that similarity in ceramic design entails similarity of social process; hence the dynamics of power and control postulated for the Shashe-Limpopo River Confluence Area (SLCA) heartland are also thought to hold for the greater hinterland.    Excavations at Mutamba yielded multiple strands of information that suggest a reappraisal of the accepted view of hinterland society as inert and un-influential in regional dynamics. The presence of glass beads, gold, iron, copper, wild cotton cloth and marine shells imply that hinterland sites, like Mutamba, had access to a repertoire of artifacts traditionally considered to be restricted to elite consumption. The presence of gold from a hinterland site, suggests its use in both local and regional negotiations of power as well as to obtain other items through diverse trade networks. This indicates that hinterland communities had significant agentive power in shaping their participation and acceptance of exotic items.    Production activities at Mutamba point to a variety of different strategies and scales of organization. Evidence indicates that both shell-bead manufacture and cotton spinning took place within household settings. Shell beads were produced on a limited scale reflecting production to satisfy household needs with some surplus for trade purposes. Cotton spinning points to a much greater involvement in production by many members of the household. In contrast to both, metals were crafted by small groups of specialists, while smelting probably took place off-site. My research supports a view of hinterland communities actively exploiting ecological and environmental settings to engage with long distance trade networks. The picture that emerges is one of a society in which economic participation and power over vast hinterlands were variable. Regionally specific activities such as the production of spun fiber enabled dispersed communities to acquire long distance goods.    The contrasting patterns between the Mapungubwe hinterland and heartland suggest that hierarchy formation in the heartland co-occurred with the horizontal expansion of social relations through networking strategies in the hinterland. Evidence from Mutamba shows that political power at Mapungubwe was counterpoised between maintaining generalized subsistence production and more intensive efforts to acquire trade goods. Centralization and control of exotic items may have existed in tension with the necessity to maintain networks of interaction in order to obtain long distance items. In the Mapungubwe heartland, there was a clear emphasis on centralizing processes and the accumulation of material wealth. However, at settlements in the hinterland, the distribution of prestige items suggests that hinterland communities were able to use their position to acquire trade goods usually considered restricted to elite spheres of society in the heartland. The heartland's interaction with hinterland communities was one of forging networks, with a greater emphasis on wealth in people than control over the economy of the hinterland. At a regional scale, this resulted in a society with weak vertical control and a fluctuating, flexible system of horizontal integration. Centralization in the SLCA was distinguished from a heterogeneous and varied hinterland occupied by foragers, herders, and farming communities. The Mapungubwe hinterland was a region where class and power was expressed in a diversity of ways.

T1  - Cyanotoxins: Bioaccumulation and Effects on Aquatic Animals
AN  - 1536074786
AB  - Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes with wide geographic distribution that can produce secondary metabolites named cyanotoxins. These toxins can be classified into three main types according to their mechanism of action in vertebrates: hepatotoxins, dermatotoxins and neurotoxins. Many studies on the effects of cyanobacteria and their toxins over a wide range of aquatic organisms, including invertebrates and vertebrates, have reported acute effects (e.g., reduction in survivorship, feeding inhibition, paralysis), chronic effects (e.g., reduction in growth and fecundity), biochemical alterations (e.g., activity of phosphatases, GST, AChE, proteases), and behavioral alterations. Research has also focused on the potential for bioaccumulation and transferring of these toxins through the food chain. Although the herbivorous zooplankton is hypothesized as the main target of cyanotoxins, there is not unquestionable evidence of the deleterious effects of cyanobacteria and their toxins on these organisms. Also, the low toxin burden in secondary consumers points towards biodilution of microcystins in the food web as the predominant process. In this broad review we discuss important issues on bioaccumulation and the effects of cyanotoxins, with emphasis on microcystins, as well as drawbacks and future needs in this field of research.

T1  - Les Rongeurs de France - 3 ème édition:&nbsp;Faunistique et Biologie
AN  - 2148094856
AB  - Cet ouvrage en impression à la demande sera envoyé sous 3 semaines environ (France métropolitaine) et dans un colis séparé en cas de commande avec un autre livre papier. Les rongeurs représentent actuellement l'un des ordres les plus diversifiés des mammifères. Répartis sur tous les continents, ils possèdent des niches écologiques très variées. Ils constituent un monde où se retrouvent des espèces « sympathiques » comme l'écureuil ou la marmotte, « effrayantes » comme les rats, ou tout simplement parfaitement inconnues comme nombre de campagnols. Ils peuvent être source de dommages importants ou vecteurs de maladies. En France ils se répartissent en 6 familles (21 genres et 31 espèces). Tout d'abord décrits dans leur rapport avec l'environnement puis avec l'homme, ils sont ensuite présentés dans une monographie illustrée. Cette nouvelle édition fait une synthèse unique et des plus récentes sur le sujet., elle précise les notions développées dans certains chapitres de la précédente édition : santé publique, régulation des populations. Elle actualise la réglementation (lutte et protection). Elle tient compte des nouvelles connaissances acquises sur plusieurs espèces (introductions récentes, nouvelles espèces...)

T1  - Invasive shipping rules put jobs at risk: New York set to impose tough new environmental standards on water
AN  - 898871758
AB  - "They've heard that message loud and clear from any number of people," said Bruce Wood, president of the Hamilton Port Authority. "It's also against the treaties we have with them, but we can't do anything about it yet because they haven't actually imposed them."              "This would really hurt us because we're the big dog on the lakes, the largest Canadian port and the second largest on both sides of the Great Lakes," Wood said. "If your business is tied into the Seaway system and it's shut down by these regulations the impact will be very severe."              "This is a very real concern because you have to transit New York waters to move up the Seaway," he said. "The impact of something like this would be terrible."

T1  - Relationship between element concentrations and body size in the Lake Maggiore population of Unio pictorum mancus (Mollusca, Bivalvia)
AN  - 2417742920
AB  - The study focused on using a fresh-water mussel (Unio pictorum mancus) as a bioindicator of various pollutants, and particularly metals. The elements considered were: Al, As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, V and Zn. This research was carried out at a site where various other studies have been conducted on important characteristics of the same population of Unio. This site is a small bay called "Sabbie d’Oro" located on the south-east coast of Lake Maggiore. Our study involved quantifying the capacity of this mollusc to concentrate large amounts of metal in its body without evident consequences by using detoxification mechanisms. We analysed not only element concentrations, but also their variability (expressed as CV%) in the soft tissues and in the shell, for two main reasons: i) the sampling design should include a preliminary analysis to determine how many specimens is necessary collect to ensure a specified level of precision; ii) the sample variability value may be combined with the value of analytical precision (BCR) to obtain an estimate of the "experimental" precision. In soft tissue, Ca accumulation tended to increase with size, and Al accumulation decreased with size. In shell, Ca and Ni were stored more than in soft tissue, but not proportionally to size. V, Cr and Mo tended to accumulate in the shell progressively over the years, whereas Co and Al are "diluted" during growth, or are absorbed mainly during the juvenile stage. Partition between shell and soft tissue resulted roughly the same in the juvenile and adult stages for the following elements: Fe, Al, Co, As, Pb. The relationships among the various elements were schematized in a hierarchical tree plot.

T1  - Identification of Reproduction-Specific Genes Associated with Maturation and Estrogen Exposure in a Marine Bivalve Mytilus edulis
AN  - 1305528338
AB  - Background While it is established that vertebrate-like steroids, particularly estrogens (estradiol, estrone) and androgens (testosterone), are present in various tissues of molluscs, it is still unclear what role these play in reproductive endocrinology in such organisms. This is despite the significant commercial shellfishery interest in several bivalve species and their decline. Methodology/Principal Findings Using suppression subtraction hybridisation of mussel gonad samples at two stages (early and mature) of gametogenesis and (in parallel) following controlled laboratory estrogen exposure, we isolate several differentially regulated genes including testis-specific kinases, vitelline lysin and envelope sequences. Conclusions The differentially expressed mRNAs isolated provide evidence that mussels may be impacted by exogenous estrogen exposure.

T1  - Phylogeography of a Land Snail Suggests Trans-Mediterranean Neolithic Transport
AN  - 1304813362
AB  - Background 
Fragmented distribution ranges of species with little active dispersal capacity raise the question about their place of origin and the processes and timing of either range fragmentation or dispersal. The peculiar distribution of the land snail Tudorella sulcata s. str. in Southern France, Sardinia and Algeria is such a challenging case.
 Methodology 
Statistical phylogeographic analyses with mitochondrial COI and nuclear hsp70 haplotypes were used to answer the questions of the species' origin, sequence and timing of dispersal. The origin of the species was on Sardinia. Starting from there, a first expansion to Algeria and then to France took place. Abiotic and zoochorous dispersal could be excluded by considering the species' life style, leaving only anthropogenic translocation as parsimonious explanation. The geographic expansion could be dated to approximately 8,000 years before present with a 95% confidence interval of 10,000 to 3,000 years before present.
 Conclusions 
This period coincides with the Neolithic expansion in the Western Mediterranean, suggesting a role of these settlers as vectors. Our findings thus propose that non-domesticated animals and plants may give hints on the direction and timing of early human expansion routes.

T1  - Mute swans in downtown waters are majestic - but unwanted
AN  - 867895979
AB  - "Those are mute swans," said Ralph Toninger, the authority's habitat restoration manager. "They are an invasive species."              "They're like zebra mussels or purple loosestrife," agreed Scott Petrie, a provincial expert on mute swans. "I've got absolutely no love for them at all."              By "managed," he meant their eggs are sprayed with vegetable oil so oxygen can't pass through the shell, smothering the embryo. This is better than smashing the shells, I was told, as the mothers don't catch on and therefore don't start laying anew.

T1  - Insect Ecology:&nbsp;An Ecosystem Approach
AN  - 2131726975
AB  - The third edition of "Insect Ecology: An Ecosystem Approach" provides a modern perspective of insect ecology that integrates two approaches traditionally used to study insect ecology: evolutionary and ecosystem. This integration substantially broadens the scope of insect ecology and contributes to prediction and resolution of the effects of current environmental changes, as these affect and are affected by insects. The third edition includes an updated and expanded synthesis of feedback and interactions between insects and their environment. This updated material and a new chapter on applications of insect ecology to social and environmental issues effectively demonstrates how evolutionary and ecosystem approaches complement each other, with the intent of stimulating further integration of these approaches in experiments that address insect roles in ecosystems. Effective management of ecosystem resources depends on evaluation of the complex, often complementary, effects of insects on ecosystem conditions, as well as insect responses to changing conditions. OCo Timely revision of a key reference on insect ecology OCo Full coverage of ecosystem structure and function balanced with essential background on evolutionary aspects OCo New chapter on applications to issues such as pest management, ecosystem restoration, invasive species and environmental changes OCo Case studies highlight practical and theoretical applications for topics covered in each chapter"

T1  - Patterns in distribution, growth, and trophodynamics of striped bass early life stages in the estuarine transition region of upper Chesapeake Bay
AN  - 904156697
AB  - Variable production of young striped bass Morone saxatilis in the estuarine transition region depends on environmental and hydrographic conditions in the estuarine turbidity maximum (ETM) and salt front region of Chesapeake Bay. Spatio-temporal variability in occurrence, growth, and diet of early life stages of striped bass and zooplankton prey were compared in years of average (2007) and poor (2008) production of striped bass juveniles. Stable isotope analyses tracked sources of carbon and nitrogen in larval striped bass diets. The estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis was the most important prey. It and the freshwater cladoceran Bosmina longirostris dominated diets of striped bass larvae.  Bosmina  was relatively important in 2007. Larvae grew faster in 2007 than in 2008 and growth was fastest within and up-estuary of the ETM and salt front.  Stable isotope analysis indicated that carbon from both marine and terrestrial sources supports production of striped bass larvae.

T1  - Implementing a PCR-RFLP analysis method to identify illegal exotic oysters for the State of Texas
AN  - 888038143
AB  - An internal validation study was conducted to consider the adoption of a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method shown in a study by Cordes et al (2008) to provide discrimination between commercially harvested oyster species.  Through the digestion of amplified fragments of the ITS-1 nuclear DNA gene region and the COI mitochondrial DNA region with the restriction enzymes Hae III and Dde I respectively, a unique fragment profile is achieved that allows for a genetic method of differentiation between the two most prevalent edible oyster species that are marketed in Texas, the native, Crassostrea virginica and an exotic,  Crassostrea gigas.  The results of this study provide the Texas Parks and Wildlife Law Enforcement Forensic Laboratory with a genetic method to assist with the identification of wildlife code violations of possession of live C. gigas.

T1  - Exposures to multiple environmental chemicals (lead, methylmercury and polychlorinated biphenyls) among childbearing-aged women in the U.S.
AN  - 862362716
AB  - It is estimated that 5 to 20% of neurodevelopmental disabilities in children are caused by environmental toxic exposures. Lead, methylmercury and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are known to have neurobehavioral and neurodevelopmental consequences in animal models and human population studies. Bioaccumulation and exposures during gestation transfer from mother to fetus via the placenta and to an infant and young child through lactation. Little is known about multiple environmental chemical exposures, especially among childbearing-aged women.    This descriptive and exploratory study involved analysis of existing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a national probability sample. Lead, methylmercury and the summed value of four lipid-adjusted PCB congeners (118, 138/158, 153, 180) were measured in the blood or serum of childbearing-aged females aged 16 to 49 of diverse races and ethnicities who were living in the U.S. 1999 to 2004, including a subset of pregnant women. Exposure was defined as two or more xenobiotic blood levels at or above the geometric mean. Sexton, Olden and Johnson’s modified environmental health paradigm (1993) guided the selection of 62 measures of vulnerability (susceptibility- and exposure-related attributes, socioeconomic factors and race-ethnicity).    Findings were reported for weighted (adjusted) data. The prevalence of exposures was widespread among childbearing-aged women, one fifth of whom had xenobiotic blood levels at or above the geometric mean for all three chemicals. Overall, pregnant women had lower prevalence rates. Best-fit logistic regression exposure model contained 13 variables. Three were notable. Any  fish consumption in past 30 days tripled the risk. A non-linear relationship was demonstrated with increasing age, exponential at ages 40 to 49. Past and current breastfeeding was protective for these women. Current pregnancy was protective with regard to individual chemical exposures only. Statistically significant two-way interactions were identified even though the paradigm could not be fully tested.    Further research on exposures to multiple environmental chemicals using the modified environmental health paradigm is needed. Xenobiotic biomonitoring in conjunction with risk communication among childbearing-aged women is encouraged. Precautionary level interventions aimed at eliminating or minimizing exposures are urgently needed. Bioaccumulation and transgenerational consequences of exposures should be addressed in public health policy.

T1  - Threat of invasive pests from within national borders
AN  - 925974172
AB  - Predicting and ranking potential invasive species present significant challenges to researchers and biosecurity agencies. Here we analyse a worldwide database of pest species assemblages to generate lists of the top 100 insect pests most likely to establish in the United States and each of its 48 contiguous states. For the United States as a whole, all of the top 100 pest species have already established. Individual states however tend to have many more 'gaps' with most states having at least 20 species absent from their top 100 list. For all but one state, every exotic pest species currently absent from a state's top 100 can be found elsewhere in the contiguous United States. We conclude that the immediate threat from known invasive insect pests is greater from within the United States than without. Our findings have potentially significant implications for biosecurity policy, emphasizing the need to consider biosecurity measures beyond established national border interventions.

T1  - The Waste of Biodiversity
AN  - 816709949
AB  - While Australian consumers produce large amounts of waste, larger amounts of waste are generated in the course of producing the goods and services consumed. This paper reviews the nature of waste and the impacts of a range of wastes on biodiversity. It demonstrates that the ecological impacts of wastes are pervasive and widespread. Typically, the wastes associated with the production of goods and services have a greater impact on biodiversity than the wastes generated during the consumption of those goods and services. There is consequently an onus on consumers to minimise wasteful consumption and to choose products and services with less embodied waste. There is also an onus on society to establish a system that makes producers and consumers accountable for the wastes embodied in the goods and services that they trade. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AN  - 2131383172
AB  - An important guide to assessing and managing the environment from a landscape perspective 
Ecological relationships are nested within the landscape. Identifying the relevant spatial and temporal scales is critical for an effective understanding of ecological functions that human societies depend upon. Moreover, human encroachment into natural areas, or changes in climate, can alter spatial relationships, which in turn can negatively affect vital plant and wildlife patterns--and weaken economic structures needed to sustain human societies. This book is the first to combine multiple disciplines into one cohesive strategy to study these crucial connections, and looks toward building a social paradigm that embraces the dynamics of ecological systems. This book: 
 
 
Integrates landscape ecology, environmental risk assessment, valuation of ecological goods and services, and environmental management decision processes into one single source  
 
Includes chapters on quantitative measures, Bayesian modeling,¿economic analysis, and sustainable landscapes  
 
Covers marine, forest, agricultural, and pharmaceutical risk assessment  
 
Has a chapter on predicting climate change risk to ecosystems  
 
Has a companion ftp site with color graphics, animations, and risk assessment tools   
With material that is accessible across all knowledge levels, Environmental Risk Assessment and Management from a 
Landscape Perspective moves beyond looking solely at chemical contaminants to diagnose environmental threats, and aims to accomplish practical risk assessment in a manner that supports long-term sustainable management.

T1  - Coalbed Natural Gas: Energy and Environment:&nbsp;Energy and Environment
AN  - 2131358537
AB  - Energy and environment are interconnected and an integral part of human society. The need for exploring energy resources (coal, oil, natural gas, coalbed methane, uranium, oil shale, wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal) to meet skyrocketing energy demands while protecting the environment (atmosphere, lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere) has become obvious in recent years. As society relies more heavily on difficult to extract and non-traditional energy resources, it is often more challenging to ensure a low impact on the environment. This book offers a review of global energy supplies over a period of ~30 years indicating a steady increase (>30%) in the use of natural gas (including coalbed natural gas, CBNG) driven by expansion of global economies and global population growth.

T1  - Ontario wants U.S. court to lock out Asian carp
AN  - 439650599
AB  - On New Year's Eve, Ontario filed a motion supporting Michigan's case. On Friday, the court will start examining everything submitted in the case and decide whether Ontario can participate. Michigan's motion is to close the navigational locks in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal permanently.                 "They could potentially be a big problem," said Mark Carabetta, conservation manager at the environmental group Ontario Nature, pointing to two other invasive species introduced into the Great Lakes - the sea lamprey and the zebra mussel.

T1  - The reproductive ecology of a northeastern Pacific nudibranch, Janolus fuscus, with an examination of its endoparasitic copepod, Ismaila belciki
AN  - 847541787
AB  - The arminacean nudibranch Janolus fuscus (family Zephyrinidae) is found in rocky intertidal habitats along the northeast Pacific coast. Adult  J. fuscus are conspicuous from April to October but absent in the early winter at two sites, North Cove and Fossil Pt., in the Coos Bay region of Oregon. Over four years of intertidal surveys at these sites, the density of J. fuscus peaked with the abundance of their bryozoan prey, Bugula pacifica and Tricellaria circumternata , in spring and summer, while adult absence in winter was correlated with strong winter storms. To describe the timing of development and determine the life cycle of J. fuscus, embryos and larvae were reared in the laboratory and examined with light, scanning electron, and confocal microscopy. Larvae reared in the lab and juveniles collected from the field were monitored to quantify growth. Janolus fuscus exhibited typical spiral cleavage and hatched as planktotrophic veligers that grew for over a month before they reached competency, settled, and metamorphosed on their prey, B. pacifica. Juvenile growth was rapid, and adults reached maximum sizes of over 50 mm before dying. These demographic and developmental studies suggest that J. fuscus is a subannual species with a life span of approximately five months. Janolus fuscus is often infected with an endoparasitic copepod, Ismaila belciki. In the field, prevalence of I. belciki increased with host density and size. The distribution of I. belciki was weakly aggregated in the host population. The large female parasite was generally found in the anterior portion of the host hemocoel, and one or more dwarf males were typically associated with each female. Infected J. fuscus  produced significantly smaller egg masses with fewer larvae than did uninfected individuals. Infection did not influence growth rate but did cause decreased survival in older nudibranchs. To examine the life cycle of  I. belciki, naupliar larvae were reared in the lab and incubated with potential hosts. Additionally, copepodid stages were described from dissected  J. fuscus collected from the field. Ismaila belciki has a least three planktotrophic naupliar stages and four copepodid stages in its life cycle.

T1  - Phylogeography and population structure of the grape powdery mildew fungus, Erysiphe necator, from diverse Vitisspecies
AN  - 2955180179
AB  - Background 
The grape powdery mildew fungus, Erysiphe necator, was introduced into Europe more than 160 years ago and is now distributed everywhere that grapes are grown. To understand the invasion history of this pathogen we investigated the evolutionary relationships between introduced populations of Europe, Australia and the western United States (US) and populations in the eastern US, where E. necator is thought to be native. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that populations of E. necator in the eastern US are structured based on geography and Vitis host species.
 Results 
We sequenced three nuclear gene regions covering 1803 nucleotides from 146 isolates of E. necator collected from the eastern US, Europe, Australia, and the western US. Phylogeographic analyses show that the two genetic groups in Europe represent two separate introductions and that the genetic groups may be derived from eastern US ancestors. Populations from the western US and Europe share haplotypes, suggesting that the western US population was introduced from Europe. Populations in Australia are derived from European populations. Haplotype richness and nucleotide diversity were significantly greater in the eastern US populations than in the introduced populations. Populations within the eastern US are geographically differentiated; however, no structure was detected with respect to host habitat (i.e., wild or cultivated). Populations from muscadine grapes, V. rotundifolia, are genetically distinct from populations from other Vitis host species, yet no differentiation was detected among populations from other Vitis species.
 Conclusions 
Multilocus sequencing analysis of the grape powdery mildew fungus is consistent with the hypothesis that populations in Europe, Australia and the western US are derived from two separate introductions and their ancestors were likely from native populations in the eastern US. The invasion history of E. necator follows a pattern consistent with plant-mediated dispersal, however, more exhaustive sampling is required to make more precise conclusions as to origin. E. necator shows no genetic structure across Vitis host species, except with respect to V. rotundifolia.

T1  - Caretakers of the Garden of Delight and Discontent Adirondack Narrative, Conflict, and Environmental Virtue
AN  - 2027335186
AB  - This dissertation concerns a widely recognized natural area, New York's Adirondack Park, that serves both as an international model for conservation and as a context for persistent conflict over natural resources, space, wealth and esthetics. It employs narrative inquiry as a method to examine the sources and the function of narratives or stories explaining the history and the present status of social groups in the Park. Narrative theorists maintain that we borrow from such socially circulating narratives to craft our own identities, and then repeat them until we believe them, almost without regard for the factual basis in history or science. The dissertation follows the progress of the author, a professor of environmental studies at a small Adirondack college, as he delves into the formation of his own Adirondack identity and values while traveling with his family from the state capital, Albany, deep into the Adirondack interior. The interdisciplinary approach includes a critical overview of environmental history as it pertains to class and conflict in the Adirondack Park, an exposition of narrative epistemology, interviews with four subjects, a praxis-oriented exploration of environmental virtue, and targeted memoir. This narrative dissertation is at once an intellectual, philosophical, personal and spatial voyage toward a set of answers, or more clearly articulated questions, concerning how one regional community struggles toward finding a satisfactory balance between nature and culture. The author identifies a set of themes that help to bound and conclude the inquiry: Landside and Lakeside, Camps and Camping and the Virtues of the Caretaker.

T1  - Growth Rate Consequences of Coloniality in a Harmful Phytoplankter
AN  - 1289252073
AB  - Background  
Allometric studies have shown that individual growth rate is inversely related to body size across a broad spectrum of organisms that vary greatly in size. Fewer studies have documented such patterns within species. No data exist directly documenting the influence of colony size on growth rate for microscopic, colonial organisms. 
 Methodology/Principal Findings  
To determine if similar negative relationships between growth rate and size hold for colonial organisms, we developed a technique for measuring the growth of individual colonies of a bloom-forming, toxic cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa using microscopy and digital image analysis. For five out of six genotypes of M. aeruginosa isolated from lakes in Michigan and Alabama, we found significant negative relationships between colony size and growth rate. We found large intraspecific variation in both the slope of these relationships and in the growth rate of colonies at a standard size. In addition, growth rate estimates for individual colonies were generally consistent with population growth rates measured using standard batch culture. 
 Conclusions/Significance  
Given that colony size varies widely within populations, our results imply that natural populations of colonial phytoplankton exist as a mosaic of individuals with widely varying ecological attributes (since size strongly affects growth rate, grazing mortality, and migration speed). Quantifying the influence of colony size on growth rate will permit development of more accurate, predictive models of ecological interactions (e.g., competition, herbivory) and their role in the proliferation of harmful algal blooms, in addition to increasing our understanding about why these interactions vary in strength within and across environments.

T1  - The Game of Conservation:&nbsp;International Treaties to Protect the World's Migratory Animals
AN  - 2131023474
AB  - The Game of Conservation is a brilliantly crafted and highly readable examination of nature protection around the world.Twentieth-century nature conservation treaties often originated as attempts to regulate the pace of killing rather than as attempts to protect animal habitat. Some were prompted by major breakthroughs in firearm techniques, such as the invention of the elephant gun and grenade harpoons, but agricultural development was at least as important as hunting regulations in determining the fate of migratory species. The treaties had many defects, yet they also served the goal of conservation to good effect, often saving key species from complete extermination and sometimes keeping the population numbers at viable levels. It is because of these treaties that Africa is dotted with large national parks, that North America has an extensive network of bird refuges, and that there are any whales left in the oceans. All of these treaties are still in effect today, and all continue to influence nature-protection efforts around the globe.Drawing on a wide variety of primary and secondary sources, Mark Cioc shows that a handful of treaties-all designed to protect the world's most commercially important migratory species-have largely shaped the contours of global nature conservation over the past century. The scope of the book ranges from the African savannahs and the skies of North America to the frigid waters of the Antarctic.

T1  - Challenges for the Development of New Non-Toxic Antifouling Solutions
AN  - 1525997525
AB  - Marine biofouling is of major economic concern to all marine industries. The shipping trade is particularly alert to the development of new antifouling (AF) strategies, especially green AF paint as international regulations regarding the environmental impact of the compounds actually incorporated into the formulations are becoming more and more strict. It is also recognised that vessels play an extensive role in invasive species propagation as ballast waters transport potentially threatening larvae. It is then crucial to develop new AF solutions combining advances in marine chemistry and topography, in addition to a knowledge of marine biofoulers, with respect to the marine environment. This review presents the recent research progress made in the field of new non-toxic AF solutions (new microtexturing of surfaces, foul-release coatings, and with a special emphasis on marine natural antifoulants) as well as the perspectives for future research directions.

T1  - Mercury distribution in the main compartments of the eutrophic Lake Candia (Northern Italy)
AN  - 2417752061
AB  - Total mercury (T-Hg) and organic mercury (mainly methylmercury, MeHg) concentrations in the most important compartments (water, sediment, macrophytes, zooplankton, mussels and fish) of the shallow and eutrophic Lake Candia (Turin, Northern Italy) were measured. The decreasing sequence of the T-Hg concentrations is as follows: cat-fish (143 μg kg-1 d.w.), zooplankton (77 μg kg-1 d.w.), Unio pictorum mancus (37.9 μg kg-1 d.w.), macrophytes (28.9 μg kg-1 d.w.). The content of mercury in mussel tissues increased with the size of the animal, but the relationship between Hg concentration and tissue weight was negative, indicating that the rate of mercury accumulation was lower than the tissue growth rate. The amount of mercury accumulated in the mussels living in the lake sediments was estimated to be 0.54 μg m-2. The importance of mercury biomagnification is also discussed.

T1  - Systematics and phylogeny of arcoid bivalves (Arcoida: Pteriomorphia: Bivalvia)
AN  - 304856361
AB  - The Arcoida is a large group of mostly marine bivalves, with a global distribution. Familiar taxa in this group include the arks, bittersweets and dog cockles. Relationships among the higher-level taxa of the Arcoida are not well understood and the classification of this group has been the subject of debate and rearrangement. While many views exist as to the evolution of this group, none of them are based explicitly on a phylogenetic analysis. In this study, the phylogenetic relationship of the Arcoida is inferred from a systematic analysis based on both morphological and molecular data. This is the first analysis in which representatives of all seven nominal families are included. 141 morphological characters from the external shell and internal anatomy were coded for 131 taxa. The phylogenetic signal of both these character types was explored. Few nonhomoplastic synapomorphies for the group were recovered; shell tubules are confirmed as the sole non-homoplastic synapomorphy for the order. Shell characters failed to recover the majority of the higher taxonomic ranks that they were initially used to describe. Little coherent signal was received from the analysis of anatomy alone. Four molecular markers, the nuclear 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, protein coding histone H3 and mitochondrial cytochrome  c oxidase I, were also investigated using direct optimization as implemented in POY (Varón et al., 2008). These data were analyzed individually as well as simultaneously with the morphological data. A Sensitivity Analysis (Wheeler, 1995) of the molecular data was also performed—this explores the effects of parameter costs (i.e. indels and transition/transversion ratios) on the phylogenetic results. The results of these phylogenetic analyses do not reflect the current classification of the group. In this study, the majority of the higher taxonomic groups of Newell (1969) were not recovered, including the two superfamilies Arcoidea and Limopsoidea, as well as five of the families; only the monophyly of the Glycymerididae and Noetiidae is supported. A major taxonomic review of the order is necessary. This analysis is the largest and most comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the Arcoida to date.

TT  - Platinum Group Elements (Pd, Pt and Rh) in Surface Waters and Their Toxicity in the Green Algae Chlamydonomas Reinhardtii
AN  - 2827702728
AB  - L'émission des éléments du groupe platine (ÉGP), soit le Pd, le Pt et le Rh, par les convertisseurs catalytiques des automobiles fait l'objet d'une préoccupation relativement récente de la part de la çommunauté scientifique. Au cours des trois dernières décennies, l'adoption, par plusieurs pays, de lois sur la qualité de l'air, a contribué à l'augmentation de l'utilisation de ces dispositifs et, par conséquent, à une croissance de la demande mondiale pour les ÉGP. Bien que ces métaux soient présents naturellement à de très faibles concentrations, ils ont été retrouvés en concentrations importantes aux abords des routes. On a également observé des concentrations croissantes en ÉGP dans le temps dans des écosystèmes éloignés de tous réseaux routiers; Les ÉGP ont notamment été détectés, dans divers compartiments environnementaux tels que le sol, les sédiments, l'eau et la neige. Cependant, le comportement de ces métaux dans l' environnement est encore peu connu. La présence des ÉGP dans l'environnement a mené à l'étude de leurs effets potentiels sur les organismes vivants. Ainsi, nous savons maintenant qu'ils sont susceptibles d'être accumulés par les espèces animales et végétales, tant aquatiques que terrestres, et qu' ils peuvent également être toxiques.Dans ce contexte, nous nous sommes d'abord attardés à quantifier les concentrations d'ÉGP dans l'eau de deux écosystèmes aquatiques en milieu urbain pour donner une idée du niveau de contamination dans la région de Québec. Dans un deuxième temps, afin d'améliorer la compréhension du transport des ÉGP, nous avons cherché à évaluer l'influence que peut avoir l'épandage de sels de voirie sur leur mobilisation. Ainsi, nous avons procédé à l'échantillonnage de deux cours d'eau et de quatre exutoires pluviaux situés à proximité de réseaux routiers achalandés, récepteurs de grandes quantités de déglaçant durant la période hivernale. Finalement, des expériences de·toxicité sur l'espèce phytoplanctonique Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ont permis de déterminer quelles gammes de concentrations en ÉGP ont un effet inhibiteur sur la croissance algale.Comme nous l'avions anticipé, les concentrations en ÉGP présentes dans l'eau de deux rivières de Québec et dans quatre exutoires pluviaux ont grandement varié tout au long de l'année. Alors que les concentrations sont parfois sous les limites de détection, elles peuvent atteindre, au site de la rivière Lorette, des valeurs de 95 ± 24 ng L-l , 14 ± 1 ng L-l et 9 ± 14 ng L-l pour le Pd, le Pt et le Rh, respectivement. Au site de la rivière Duberger, nous avons mesuré des concentrations allant jusqu'à 833 ± 114 ng L-l, 8 ± 2 ng L-l et 175 ± 4 ng L-l pour le Pd, le Pt et le Rh, respectivement. Aux deux sites, le Pd s'est avéré être présent en plus fortes concentrations que le Pt et le Rh. En parallèle des analyses de métaux, nous avons aussi mesuré les concentrations en chlorures afin d'établir une corrélation entre celles-ci et les concentrations en ÉGP observées. Bien que, dans certains cas, une relation semble se dessiner entre ces deux paramètres, les analyses statistiques n'ont pas montré de corrélation significative. La concentration en chlorures ne serait pas le seul paramètre à suivre pour expliquer la mobilisation de ces métaux.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerThe emission of platinum group elements (PGE), Pd, Pt and Rh, from automotive catalytic converters is a relatively recent concern in the scientific community. Over the past three decades, the adoption of clean air laws by several countries has contributed to the increase in the use of these devices and, consequently, to a growth in global demand. for PGEs. Although these metals are naturally present at very low concentrations, they have been found in high concentrations near roads. Increasing PGE concentrations over time have also been observed in ecosystems far from any road networks; In particular, PGEs have been detected in various environmental compartments such as soil, sediment, water and snow. However, the behavior of these metals in the environment is still little known. The presence of PGEs in the environment has led to the study of their potential effects on living organisms. Thus, we now know that they are likely to be accumulated by animal and plant species, both aquatic and terrestrial, and that they can also be toxic.In this context, we first focused on quantifying the concentrations of PGEs in the water of two aquatic ecosystems in an urban environment to give an idea of the level of contamination in the Quebec region. Secondly, in order to improve the understanding of the transport of PGEs, we sought to evaluate the influence that the spreading of road salts can have on their mobilization. Thus, we sampled two watercourses and four stormwater outlets located near busy road networks, which receive large quantities of de-icer during the winter period. Finally, toxicity experiments on the phytoplankton species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii made it possible to determine which ranges of PGE concentrations have an inhibiting effect on algal growth.As we had anticipated, the PGE concentrations present in the water of two Quebec rivers and in four stormwater outlets varied greatly throughout the year. While the concentrations are sometimes below the detection limits, they can reach, at the Lorette River site, values of 95 ± 24 ng L-l , 14 ± 1 ng L-l and 9 ± 14 ng L-l for Pd, Pt and the Rh, respectively. At the Duberger River site, we measured concentrations up to 833 ± 114 ng L-l, 8 ± 2 ng L-l and 175 ± 4 ng L-l for Pd, Pt and Rh, respectively. At both sites, Pd turned out to be present in higher concentrations than Pt and Rh. In parallel with the metal analyses, we also measured the chloride concentrations in order to establish a correlation between these and the observed PGE concentrations. Although, in some cases, a relationship seems to emerge between these two parameters, the statistical analyzes did not show a significant correlation. The chloride concentration would not be the only parameter to follow to explain the mobilization of these metals.

T1  - The Bioenergetic Cost of Metal Resistance and its Consequences for Reproduction in the Harbour Ragworm, Nereis Diversicolor
AN  - 1033194797
AB  - The population of harbour ragworms, Nereis diversicolor,inhabiting the upper reaches of Restronguet Creek in the Fal Ria, UK, are known to be resistant to the acute, toxic effects of copper, zinc and cadmium. This research aimed to establish whether metabolic and reproductive performance costs were associated with the resistance phenomenon and what the biochemical mechanisms of resistance were, by comparing animals from the Creek with two comparable study sites in the South West of England: Froe Creek and the Teign estuary. There was a significant metabolic cost, measured as a reduction in Scope for Growth, associated with the resistance phenomenon. As no differences in energy intake or uptake were found between resistant and non-resistant animals it was concluded that this cost was covered by demand-side regulation of energetics. A reduction in the amount of biochemical energy reserves in the form of lipids and sugars was also observed in resistant animals suggesting that resource allocation had been shifted away from this endpoint and towards maintenance and activity.The perturbed metabolism and physiology of resistant N. diversicoloris shown to have detrimental consequences for their life-history. Sexually mature, resistant females were significantly smaller than non-resistant ones, indicating that they had either matured at a younger age or grown more slowly. Both total fecundity and mass-specific fecundity were significantly reduced in resistant females, likely as a direct result of the metabolic costs of resistance reducing the resources available to fuel gametogenesis. No differences were found in the energetic reserves stocked within each gamete by resistant and non-resistant animals, suggesting that this trait is heavily selected for.Synthesis of reduced glutathione [GSH] in resistant animals’ tissues appeared to be elevated. Glutathione peroxidase activity was also increased, likely to remediate the effects of Reactive Chemical Species [RCS] that result from the inevitably incomplete binding of intracellular metals. As GSH functions in metal detoxification to covalently binding metals entering resistant animals’ cells, preventing their involvement in toxic interactions and their catalysis of the production of RCS, it is proposed that together there two phenomena comprise the fundamental mechanism of resistance to metal toxicity.Ultimately, this research revealed a hierarchy of health and reproductive performance across the three study populations, with significant associations evident between measured biological endpoints and the degree of metal contamination, illustrating the consequences of anthropogenic pollution for the biology of wild animals.

T1  - Molecular identification key based on PCR/RFLP for three polychaete sibling species of the genus Marenzelleria, and the species' current distribution in the Baltic Sea
AN  - 205280758
AB  - Studies of Marenzelleria species were often hampered by identification uncertainties when using morphological characters only. A newly developed PCR/RFLP protocol allows a more efficient discrimination of the three species Marenzelleria viridis, Marenzelleria neglecta and Marenzelleria arctia currently known for the Baltic Sea. The protocol is based on PCR amplification of two mitochondrial DNA gene segments (16S, COI) followed by digestion with restriction enzymes. As it is faster and cheaper than PCR/sequencing protocols used so far, the protocol is recommended for large-scale analyses. The markers allow an undoubted determination of species irrespective of life stage or condition of the worms in the samples. The protocol was validated on about 950 specimens sampled at more than 30 sites of the Baltic and the North Sea, and on specimens from populations of the North American east coast. Besides this test we used mitochondrial DNA sequences (16S, COI, Cytb) and starch gel electrophoresis to further investigate the distribution of the three Marenzelleria species in the Baltic Sea. The results show that M. viridis (formerly genetic type I or M. cf. wireni) occurred in the Öresund area, in the south western as well as in the eastern Baltic Sea, where it is found sympatric with M. neglecta. Allozyme electrophoresis indicated an introduction by range expansion from the North Sea. The second species, M. arctia, was only found in the northern Baltic Sea, where it sometimes occurred sympatric with M. neglecta or M. viridis. For Baltic M. arctia, the most probable way of introduction is by ship ballast water from the European Arctic. There is an urgent need for a new genetic analysis of all Marenzelleria populations of the Baltic Sea to unravel the current distribution of the three species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Nanaimo boaters aren't the only ones [Cathryn Clarke Murray] needs input from - she hopes everyone travelling in B.C. waters completes the survey.  

              
Keeping an eye on all the species that enter B.C. waters is difficult, she said, but it's important to protect B.C.'s marine habitat. 

              
There are 12 invasive species on which Clarke Murray is focusing in her research, including several species of tunicate - the club, violet golden star, red and vase. She is also tracking the sea grape, zebra mussel, single horn bryozoan, bryozoan, yellow sponge and wireweed.

T1  - Pollution of Lakes and Rivers:&nbsp;A Paleoenvironmental Perspective
AN  - 2131946873
AB  - Water is an essential life resource, yet the pollution of lakes and rivers has become an international problem, reaching crisis proportions in many regions. As demands on aquatic resources escalate, we must find new approaches to meet the challenges of the 21st century.
 
Now in its second edition, 
Pollution of Lakes and Rivers addresses many of our present-day water quality problems from an international perspective, covering critical issues such as acidification, eutrophication, land-use changes, pollution by metals and other contaminants, climatic change, and biodiversity losses. It demonstrates how paleolimnological approaches can be used to interpret the physical, chemical, and biological information stored in lake and river sediments, and how this information is integral to identifying key environmental stressors and setting targets for mitigation purposes.
 
The expanded second edition includes over 250 additional references and a new chapter on recent climatic change and its effects on water quality and quantity. This comprehensive, up-to-date volume provides essential insights into a multi-disciplinary science aimed at tackling some of the most urgent environmental problems of modern times.
 
PowerPoint slides of the artwork from the book are available from: http://biology.queensu.ca/~pearl/textbook.htm
 
Reviews:
 
"This is a useful text. It provides a good level of detail so that the beginner in this area can appreciate what palaeolimnology can (and cannot) achieve. It goes beyond the simple introduction to provide a detailed understanding of how techniques can be applied ... This is a different take on the usual pollution text and would be of great use to those wishing to understand more from sedimentary records."

It is an emerging, interdisciplinary field that aims to understand how human and ecological processes can coexist in human-dominated systems and help societies with their efforts to become more sustainable. It has deep roots in many disciplines including sociology, geography, urban planning, landscape architecture, engineering, economics, anthropology, climatology, public health, and ecology. Because of its interdisciplinary nature and unique focus on humans and natural systems, the term "urban ecology" has been used variously to describe the study of humans in cities, of nature in cities, and of the coupled relationships between humans and nature. Each of these research areas is contributing to our understanding of urban ecosystems and each must be understood to fully grasp the science of Urban Ecology. Therefore, in Urban Ecology: An International Perspective on the Interaction Between Humans and Nature, we introduce students and practitioners of urban ecology to its roots, bases, and prospects by way of a diverse collection of historical and modern foundational readings. The editors are urban ecologists from the United States, Italy, and Germany who together view these readings as a fair representation of the importance of both natural and social sciences to Urban Ecology. 
This book presents important papers in the field of Urban Ecology that both set the foundations for the discipline and to illustrate modern approaches, from a variety of perspectives and regions of the world. The editors do this by reprinting important publications, filling gaps in the published literature with a few targeted original works, and translating several key works originally published in German. The aim of this collection is to provide students, practitioners, and professionals with a rich background in some of the core facets of Urban Ecology.

T1  - Diversity and evolution of 185/333, an immune -related gene family from the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus
AN  - 304642578
AB  - Growing evidence suggests that the purple sea urchin immune system is more complex than previously believed. Analysis of the sea urchin genome reveals a number of gene families with homology to vertebrate innate immune receptors, in addition to lectin and complement homologues. An additional immune-related gene family, 185/333, which lacks known homologues in other species, is characterized by extraordinary diversity and is strongly upregulated in response to immunological challenge. In addition to point mutations, alignment of the sequences requires the insertion of large gaps that define elements, the presence or absence of which defines element patterns. The genes are small (<2kb) with only two exons, the second of which encodes the majority of the element pattern. The genes contain a variety of types of repeats that allow for multiple alignments. The repeats within the genes, in addition to di- and trinucleotide repeats flanking the genes and their close linkage are thought to facilitate frequent recombination among members of the gene family, thereby increasing diversity. Although a large number of genes with unique sequences have been isolated, each individual element within the genes is composed of a limited number of similar, but distinct sequences. The mosaic distribution of these sequences among the 185/333 genes also suggests frequent recombination within this gene family. Analysis of  185/333 genes isolated from coelomocyte and sperm genomic DNA indicates that the diversification is not limited to coelomocytes. Comparisons between the 185/333 gene vs. message sequences isolated from individual animals reveals that very few element patterns or nucleotide sequences are identified from both genes and messages. The messages exhibit a strong cytidine to uridine substitution pattern when compared to the genes, suggesting a post-transcriptional RNA editing mechanism that mimics cytidine deaminase activity. Thus, the diversity of the 185/333 sequences is the result of frequent recombination among the genes that is promoted by various repeats and the structure of the gene cluster, plus putative post-transcriptional editing of the messages. The 185/333 system represents a novel mechanism for generating immune diversity in an invertebrate, and further supports the concept that all organisms require immunological diversity to survive.

T1  - Field Manual of Techniques in Invertebrate Pathology:&nbsp;Application and Evaluation of Pathogens for Control of Insects and Other Invertebrate Pests
AN  - 2148118228
AB  - The Field Manual of Techniques in Invertebrate Pathology is designed to provide background and instruction on a broad spectrum of techniques and their use in the evaluation of entomopathogens in the field. The second edition of the Field Manual provides updated information and includes two additional chapters and 12 new contributors. The intended audience includes researchers, graduate students, practitioners of integrated pest management (IPM), regulators and those conducting environmental impact studies of entomopathogens. Although it can function as a stand alone reference, the Field Manual is complementary to the laboratory oriented Manual of Techniques in Insect Pathology and to comprehensive texts in insect pathology. 
The Editors have structured the 40 chapters of the Field Manual into 10 sections to provide the tools required for planning experiments with entomopathogens and their implementation in the field. The basic tools include chapters on the theory and practice of application of microbial control agents (MCAs) (Section I), statistical considerations in the design of experiments (Section II), and three chapters on application equipment and strategies (Section III). Section IV includes individual chapters on the major pathogen groups (virus, bacteria, microsporidia, fungi, and nematodes) and special considerations for their evaluation under field conditions. This section sets the stage for subsequent chapters on the impact of naturally occurring and introduced exotic pathogens and inundative application of MCAs. Twenty-three chapters on the application and evaluation of MCAs in a wide variety of agricultural, forest, domestic and aquatic habitats comprise Section VII of the Field Manual. In addition to insect pests, the inclusion of mites and slugs broadens the scope of the book. Most of the chapters in this section include step by step instructions on handling of inoculum, design of fieldexperiments and experimental plots and application and assessment of efficacy of dozens of MCAs. Several of these chapters include supplementary techniques and media for conducting follow up laboratory studies for confirmation of infection, determination of persistence, etc. The three final chapters include: special consideration for evaluation of Bt transgenic plants (Section VIII); resistance to insect pathogens and strategies to manage resistance (Section IX); and guidelines for evaluating effects of MCAs on nontarget organisms (Section X). 
Due to uncertainty regarding the future availability of organophosphate and other conventional chemical insecticides, MCAs will play increasingly important roles in IPM. The Field Manual will provide researchers and IPM practitioners with techniques and practical guidance for the study and optimal use of MCAs in a variety of settings.Provides researchers, IPM practitioners, and graduate students with techniques and practical guidance for the study and optimal use of invertebrate pathogens in a variety of settings Covers many topics including the theory and practice of microbial insecticide application, experimental design, ground based and aerial application equipment, overviews of the individual of pathogen groups, classical biological control, transgenic plants, resistance to insect pathogens, and guidelines for evaluating pathogens on non-target organisms The only book on the market that offers diverse theoretical and practical aspects of application and evaluation of invertebrate pathogens for control of invertebrate pests (insects, mites, mollusks) in a variety of agroecosystems, in public health, and against ornamental, urban and veterinary pests Provides step by step procedures written by an international group of experts for the use of invertebrate pathogens in pest control and furnishes the tools required for planning experiments and for the implementation of control programs

T1  - Mitigating Shore Erosion along Sheltered Coasts
AN  - 2131246159
AB  - Sheltered coastal areas, such as those along bays and estuaries, experience land loss from erosion and sea level rise much like ocean beaches. Owners of property along sheltered coasts often reinforce their shoreline with bulkheads and other structures to prevent erosion. However, this construction alters the coastal ecosystem, causing changes that threaten landscapes, public access, recreational opportunities, natural habitats, and fish populations. At the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology, this report examines the impacts of shoreline management on sheltered coasts. The report calls for a regional management approach that considers the environmental impacts that could accumulate if hard structures are permitted on a site by site basis. In addition the report recommends changing the current permitting system to remove the default preference for bulkheads and similar structures and allow more flexibility to encourage use of more ecologically beneficial erosion-control methods, such as planting of marshes.
Like ocean beaches, sheltered coastal areas experience land loss from erosion and sea level rise. In response, property owners often install hard structures such as bulkheads as a way to prevent further erosion, but these structures cause changes in the coastal environment that alter landscapes, reduce public access and recreational opportunities, diminish natural habitats, and harm species that depend on these habitats for shelter and food. 
Mitigating Shore Erosion Along Sheltered Coasts recommends coastal planning efforts and permitting policies to encourage landowners to use erosion control alternatives that help retain the natural features of coastal shorelines.

T1  - Ecosystem Consequences of Cyanobacteria in the Northern Baltic Sea
AN  - 207668999; 17520934
AB  - Cyanobacteria of the Baltic Sea have multiple effects on organisms that influence the food chain dynamics on several trophic levels. Cyanobacteria contain several bioactive compounds, such as alkaloids, peptides, and lipopolysaccharides. A group of nonribosomally produced oligopeptides, namely microcystins and nodularin, are tumor promoters and cause oxidative stress in the affected cells. Zooplankton graze on cyanobacteria, and when ingested, the hepatotoxins (nodularin) decrease the egg production of, for example, copepods. However, the observed effects are very variable, because many crustaceans are tolerant to nodularin and because cyanobacteria may complement the diet of grazers in small amounts. Cyanobacterial toxins are transferred through the food web from one trophic level to another. The transfer rate is relatively low in the pelagic food web, but reduced feeding and growth rates of fish larvae have been observed. In the benthic food web, especially in blue mussels, nodularin concentrations are high, and benthic feeding juvenile flounders have been observed to disappear from bloom areas. In the littoral ecosystem, gammarids have shown increased mortality and weakening of reproductive success under cyanobacterial exposure. In contrast, mysid shrimps seem to be tolerant to cyanobacterial exposure. In fish larvae, detoxication of nodularin poses a metabolic cost that is reflected as decreased growth and condition, which may increase their susceptibility to predation. Cyanobacterial filaments and aggregates also interfere with both hydromechanical and visual feeding of planktivores. The feeding appendages of mysid shrimps may clog, and the filaments interfere with prey detection of pike larvae. On the other hand, a cyanobacterial bloom may provide a refuge for both zooplankton and small fish. As the decaying bloom also provides an ample source of organic carbon and nutrients for the organisms of the microbial loop, the zooplankton species capable of selective feeding may thrive in bloom conditions. Cyanobacteria also compete for nutrients with other primary producers and change the nitrogen (N) : phosphorus (P) balance of their environment by their N-fixation. Further, the bioactive compounds of cyanobacteria directly influence other primary producers, favoring cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, dinoflagellates, and nanoflagellates and inhibiting cryptophytes. As the selective grazers also shift the grazing pressure on other species than cyanobacteria, changes in the structure and functioning of the Baltic Sea communities and ecosystems are likely to occur during the cyanobacterial bloom season.

T1  - Mammoth Goby caught in harbour: [Final Edition]
AN  - 358246169
AB  - I'm a recreational angler, so I have some knowledge of native Ontario species. The goby is a bottom-dwelling fish that has great potential for causing impacts on Great Lakes fisheries. Originally the round goby and the tubenose goby were introduced into the St. Claire River in 1990, probably via contaminated ballast water of transoceanic ships. The fish is now confirmed to have spread throughout the Great Lakes, and research studies have confirmed its presence in Hamilton Harbour.

              
   Considering Hamilton Harbour is one of the most polluted areas on Lake Ontario, it makes perfect sense the Goby would find a home here.

              
   The Goby is an ugly little fish. The only good thing about it is the fact it feeds on Zebra Mussels, another exotic and invasive species that threatens our ecosystem.

T1  - Interactions between food quantity and quality (long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid concentrations) effects on growth and development of Chironomus riparius
AN  - 219298765
AB  - We quantified somatic growth, development, and emergence of the midge Chironomus riparius on experimental diets (oats, Spirulina, and Tetraphyll®) covering gradients in food quality (differing polyunsaturated fatty acids) and quantity (0.1-5.4 mg C.day^sup -1^). Additionally, similar incubations without food additions were made using a foodpoor sediment containing peat and the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus. Larval and adult size was affected by both food quantity and quality and increased some three to four times across the food concentration gradients. Adult emergence, however, was affected only by food quantity. A type 3 response model showed that a saturation level was reached for the oats treatment at 2.7 mg C.day^sup -1^ (or 3.9 µmg ω3 and 120 µmg ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids.day^sup -1^), indicating that the quality of oats constrained further stimulation of larval growth. In the peat treatment, larval growth was very low, no adults emerged, and no larvae even made it to the pupa stage. Fatty acid analysexxs showed that larvae were capable of synthesizing arachidonic acid via γ-linolenic acid by Δ6- and Δ53-desaturase activity using linoleic acid available in food sources. This strongly suggests that C. riparius is not dependent on dietary sources of eicosapentaenoic acid and arachidonic acid and can sustain viable populations even under a low-quality food regimen.

T1  - Fate of the Great Lakes Has Impact on Guelph: [Final Edition]
AN  - 358059608
AB  - Gord Miller, who lived in Guelph between 1972 and 1978, hosted recent discussions on climate change, invasive species, water-use, ecosystem health and public information and participation in a province-wide, five-location tour.

              
   Although Guelph is landlocked, Miller said the city does see effects of climate change related to the Great Lakes. Snow squalls and lake effect storms have been common for Guelph. Miller said climate change has greatly affected the upper Great Lakes. In past years the lakes have frozen in the winter, so when winds blow across the lake water doesn't evaporate.

              
   The Great Lakes are also currently plagued with invasive species such as zebra mussels. Invasive species and bacteria are affecting the animals that make their habitat in and around the lakes, including loons, other birds and fish, said Miller.

T1  - Environmental implications of stratification and turbulent mixing in a shallow lake basin
AN  - 219358142
AB  - The extent of stratification and vertical mixing in the water column (7-11 m deep) was investigated over an offshore reef in the western basin of Lake Erie. Measurements reveal that the vertical transport of oxygen and heat is controlled by the complex interaction of several physical mechanisms. Generally, when the wind speed (W) was >7 m.s^sup -1^ and the air was cooler than the water (T^sub air^ < T^sub w^), the water column was well mixed due to turbulent mixing. However, when W < 7 m.s^sup -1^ (~65% of the summer), turbulence was too weak to overcome the stratification and mix the water column. An analysis of 25 years of meteorological data revealed that a period of 4.5 ± 1.9 days of calm, warm weather (W < 7 m.s^sup -1^ and T^sub air^ > T^sub w^) occurs every year. Results indicate that there is strong probability of hypoxia due to stratification (i.e., when diffusivities < 10^sup -6^ m^sup 2^.s^sup -1^) and sediment oxygen demand (i.e., 0.1-1.0 g.m^sup -2^.day^sup -1^) during these periods. The environmental implications of stratification to water quality and its effects on benthic organisms, such as the burrowing mayfly (Hexagenia spp.), require further considerations in large temperate lakes and basins that are sufficiently shallow that there is no permanent seasonal stratification.

T1  - Changes in Metallothionein Levels in Freshwater Mussels Exposed to Urban Wastewaters: Effects from Exposure to Heavy Metals?
AN  - 1037779116
AB  - Municipal effluents are complex mixtures of compounds such as heavy metals, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, and micro-organisms and are released in aquatic ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to verify whether changes in metallothioneins (MT) were associated with the accumulation of labile metals in tissue of freshwater mussels exposed to the dispersion plume of a major municipal effluent. Mussels were placed in experimental cages deployed at sites 1.5 km upstream, 8 km downstream and 12 km downstream of the outfall of a major, primary-treated municipal effluent in the St. Lawrence River (Québec, Canada). Mussels were analysed for MT and labile zinc levels in their gonads, gills and digestive glands. Lipogenic enzyme (isocitrate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase (COX) activities were also measured in gonad and gill tissues. Although MT was induced in all the tissues examined, the results showed that labile zinc levels were significantly reduced in gill and gonad tissues, with an increase observed only at the 12 km downstream site in the digestive gland. COX activity was readily induced in gills and gonads. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was reduced at both downstream sites, but isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was signifcantly induced at the farthest (12 km) site. Analysis of covariance revealed that MT levels in gills were more influenced by COX activity than with distance in the dispersion plume and was negatively correlated with labile zinc levels. In conclusion, MT induction was inversely related to the levels of labile zinc but positively so with the inflammation biomarker COX. Hence, the induction of MT in mussels exposed to the municipal effluent of a large city appears to be associated with either inflammatory processes or as compensation for the loss of labile essential metals. We propose that the simple and complimentary parameters of labile zinc and COX evaluations be used to link MT induction with divalent heavy metal exposure in environmental studies dealing with various type of contaminants in such complex contaminant mixture effluents.

T1  - Efficiencies of benthic and pelagic trophic pathways in a subalpine lake
AN  - 219330888
AB  - Although the study of lakes has traditionally focused on pelagic production pathways, recent stable isotope and diet evidence indicates that benthic algal production is an important contributor to fish production. This has led to the suggestion that energy may be more efficiently passed along benthic food chains relative to their pelagic counterparts. To test this idea, we combined stable isotope based assessments of energy flow pathways with estimates of pelagic- and benthic-based primary and secondary production in Castle Lake, California. Approximately 50% of whole-lake primary production and 30% of whole-lake secondary production occurred in benthic habitats. Stable carbon isotopes and dietary data indicated that fish were predominantly supported by benthic (63%) and terrestrial (24%) secondary production. Ecological efficiencies (algal production / invertebrate production) were low in Castle Lake (<3%), though zoobenthic production was more efficiently passed to fish than was zooplankton production. The larger size of benthic prey relative to pelagic prey may affect fish prey selection and foraging efficiency, resulting in differences in ecological efficiency between pelagic and benthic trophic pathways.

T1  - Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation and Contaminant-related Stressors on Arctic Freshwater Ecosystems
AN  - 207669769; 17256643
AB  - Climate change is likely to act as a multiple stressor, leading to cumulative and/or synergistic impacts on aquatic systems. Projected increases in temperature and corresponding alterations in precipitation regimes will enhance contaminant influxes to aquatic systems, and independently increase the susceptibility of aquatic organisms to contaminant exposure and effects. The consequences for the biota will in most cases be additive (cumulative) and multiplicative (synergistic). The overall result will be higher contaminant loads and biomagnification in aquatic ecosystems. Changes in stratospheric ozone and corresponding ultraviolet radiation regimes are also expected to produce cumulative and/or synergistic effects on aquatic ecosystem structure and function. Reduced ice cover is likely to have a much greater effect on underwater UV radiation exposure than the projected levels of stratospheric ozone depletion. A major increase in UV radiation levels will cause enhanced damage to organisms (biomolecular, cellular, and physiological damage, and alterations in species composition). Allocations of energy and resources by aquatic biota to UV radiation protection will increase, probably decreasing trophic-level productivity. Elemental fluxes will increase via photochemical pathways. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - 'Perfect' alien invader threatens native species: [Final Edition]
AN  - 267193539
AB  - Like the zebra and guagga mussels, gobies are native to the Black and Caspian seas in Eurasia. And like the mussels, they hitched a ride to North America in the bilge water of ocean-going freighters.                 Not surprisingly the tenacious hitchhiker is taking a toll on its new environment. As the goby numbers are exploding, native species of sculpins and darters are disappearing. The pugnacious invaders feed on small fish and on the eggs of other species of fish. They'll even attack a sunfish nest when the male is guarding it.                 The amount of zebra mussels that they consume is insignificant in the long run, but the goby diet of mussels results in the transfer of contaminants from the mussels to several species of sports fish.

T1  - Are there hot spots for Elliptio complanata in the shallow littoral zone of a large Canadian Shield lake?
AN  - 219361652
AB  - The variability in habitat conditions in large lake basins may provide areas favourable for unionid recruitment and growth. Here we test whether the distribution, body size, and growth rate of Elliptio complanata differ between upwind and downwind sites in a 5.8 km long lake basin. We measured density and morphological characteristics of E. complanata at nine upwind and nine downwind sites. We also measured growth rates and stable isotope (δ^sup 13^C, δ^sup 15^N) signatures at three upwind and three downwind sites. We found no difference in density or body size of E. complanata between upwind and downwind sites, despite clear differences in water temperature and food availability. Contrary to our expectations, the growth rate of E. complanata was higher (by 62%) at upwind sites. The reason for this difference is uncertain, but higher shell erosion and a negative relationship between δ^sup 13^C and C/N ratio suggest that E. complanata may be more stressed at downwind sites. The δ^sup 15^N of E. complanata did not differ systematically between upwind and downwind sites, but increased with increasing body size. It would therefore be prudent to standardize the size of E. complanata used to measure the baseline of lake food webs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ontario blasts feds for not protecting Great Lakes; Lakes are at significant risk of 'invasion by aquatic species from other parts of the world': [Final Edition]
AN  - 355917647
AB  - Invasive species like zebra mussels will continue to wreak environmental havoc on the Great Lakes and St. [Lawrence Cannon] Seaway unless Ottawa amends its new shipping regulations, the Ontario government said Thursday.                 Invasive species are still hitching rides in the residual water of foreign ships filled with cargo, and are unleashed as the ships drop off and pick up cargo as they take on and discharge water, she said.

T1  - Whole-lake effects of invasive crayfish (Orconectes spp.) and the potential for restoration
AN  - 219327336
AB  - Effects of invasive species are often extrapolated to whole systems based on small-scale, short-term, and (or) single-system studies. For example, previous laboratory studies and in-lake cage experiments suggest that invasive crayfish Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus reduce macrophyte and snail abundance in north temperate lakes, and snapshot lake surveys provide supporting evidence. Still, these impacts have not been demonstrated in multiple whole lakes over time. Thus, in summer of 2003, we resurveyed benthic invertebrates and macrophytes in lakes originally surveyed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in the late 1930s. Our multilake survey supports the macrophyte results from small-scale and comparative studies: macrophyte species richness and abundance declined significantly in invaded lakes relative to uninvaded lakes. We next conducted a laboratory seed-bank study to examine the potential for macrophyte restoration in a lake occupied by rusty crayfish for at least 15 years. Only two macrophyte species (Najas flexilis and Chara spp.) germinated from sediments from the invaded lake compared with eight species from reference sediments. This suggests that invaded lakes may have depauperate seed banks and that restoration of invaded macrophyte communities may require manual planting, even if crayfish could be removed.

T1  - The Ecology of Transportation: Managing Mobility for the Environment
AN  - 2131826592
AB  - Human transport by land, sea and air has increased exponentially through time in intensity, paralleling rises in population, prosperity and rates of technological change. Transport has considerable ecological effects, many of them detrimental to environmental sustainability. This volume brings together international experts from a variety of disciplines to review the ecological effects and their causes in terms of road, rail, ship and aircraft transport. The contributors have different attitudes and agendas. Some are ecologists, some planners, others social scientists. Focus ranges from identification of threats and amelioration of damaging effects through to future design of transport systems to minimize environmental degradation. Some chapters consider restricted areas of the globe; others the globe itself. Views encompass deep pessimism and cautious optimism. 
Uniquely, the volume considers transport effects in all environments. This is the first book that attempts to discuss the relationship between human transport and all ecosystems. It appeals not only to the specialist environmentalist by picking out novel topics, but also to anyone involved in transport issues as it tackles the issues from an historical perspective, encompassing the past, present and future of the effects of human transport.Considers transport effects in all environments Discusses future designs of transport systems to minimize environmental degradation Describes methods of amelioration of the damaging effects of transport on the environment

T1  - The alien invaders on our doorstep; Foreign plants, animals thriving Ontario's rivers and lakes threatened: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 438953921
AB  - There are exceptions. A few of the animal invaders were imported as bait fish. Chief among them is the European rudd, a large minnow that, after establishing itself in the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, now threatens to populate interior lakes. In January, one was found in Richmond Hill's weedy Wilcox Lake, the first-ever sighting in an inland Ontario waterway.                 Since no gobies have been found upstream of the infested mouth of the Pefferlaw River, that's almost certainly how they got there, [Beth Brownson] says. In August, the province banned the use of gobies as bait. Fishermen caught with one face penalties ranging from confiscation of their equipment to fines up to an improbable $500,000, and jail time.                 Invasive species help each other out. Gobies, for example, eat zebra mussels. So, where mussels go, the big-headed fish are eager to follow. Unfortunately, Brownson says, while gobies enjoy a diet that includes mussels, they don't consume enough to control the population.

T1  - Bentho-pelagic distribution of early stages of softshell clams (Mya arenaria) in tidally contrasted regimes
AN  - 220515256
AB  - We examined the settlement and recruitment of the softshell clam (Mya arenaria L., 1758) in two tidally contrasted regimes in eastern Canada. The Bay of Fundy (strong tides) and the Northumberland Strait (weak tides) were used to describe the distribution of planktonic larvae and early settlers. These distributions were compared with those of juvenile and adult forms observed in the same intertidal habitats. Results showed that the abundances of planktonic stages were the same at all tidal levels except in one site of the Bay of Fundy. Early settlers varied according to a site × intertidal level interaction. Juveniles and adults also varied according to a similar interaction, most being in the upper intertidal level. Simple linear regressions demonstrated that no relationship exists between the number of planktonic larvae and the number of early settlers. The only significant relationship observed was the one between the number of juveniles (1-5 mm size class) and the number of adults in one of the Northumberland Strait sites. Our results show, through the high spatial resolution and wide range of spatial scales covered by the study, that the dominant regional tidal regime does not have an effect on the distribution of the softshell clam. Local hydrodynamic effects appear to drive the intertidal distribution of the softshell clam life-cycle stages. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Dynamic Food Webs:&nbsp;Multispecies Assemblages, Ecosystem Development and Environmental Change
AN  - 2131923469
AB  - Dynamic Food Webs challenges us to rethink what factors may determine ecological and evolutionary pathways of food web development. It touches upon the intriguing idea that trophic interactions drive patterns and dynamics at different levels of biological organization: dynamics in species composition, dynamics in population life-history parameters and abundances, and dynamics in individual growth, size and behavior. These dynamics are shown to be strongly interrelated governing food web structure and stability and the role of populations and communities play in ecosystem functioning. Dynamic Food Webs not only offers over 100 illustrations, but also contains 8 riveting sections devoted to an understanding of how to manage the effects of environmental change, the protection of biological diversity and the sustainable use of natural resources. Dynamic Food Webs is a volume in the Theoretical Ecology series.  Relates dynamics on different levels of biological organization: individuals, populations, and communities Deals with empirical and theoretical approaches Discusses the role of community food webs in ecosystem functioning Proposes methods to assess the effects of environmental change on the structure of biological communities and ecosystem functioning Offers an analyses of the relationship between complexity and stability in food webs

T1  - Evidence across multiple scales for offshore transport of yellow perch (Perca flavescens) larvae in Lake Michigan
AN  - 219325605
AB  - Most freshwater fishes have short pelagic early life stages. Lake Michigan presents an interesting scenario for yellow perch (Perca flavescens), a species with a long pelagic larval stage that may not be well adapted to lakes with an expansive pelagic environment and extensive offshore transport. We investigated the possibility that early life stages of yellow perch were transported well offshore from their nearshore spawning grounds and explored whether food resources were more or less favorable offshore. To determine the extent to which pelagic age-0 yellow perch moved offshore, we sampled at multiple scales ranging from local (<2 km) to across the lake (>120 km). Evidence of offshore movement by fish larvae occurred at each scale. Yellow perch larvae were quickly transported offshore from nearshore spawning sites and remained in the offshore pelagia to sizes of at least 30 mm. Zooplankton density was greater offshore than nearshore, suggesting that pelagic age-0 yellow perch find improved food resources offshore compared with their nearshore spawning sites. Currents operating at oceanographic scales likely influenced the offshore movement of pelagic age-0 yellow perch in Lake Michigan. These currents, coupled with prey availability for pelagic age-0 individuals, may influence the recruitment success of this species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Salmon fishery in the balance: Series: Invasion on the Lakes: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349343525
AB  - Cleaning fish, he has begun finding surprises in their digestive systems including spiny water fleas, a non-native crustacean first identified in Lake Huron in December of 1984. It's one of literally dozens of exotic creatures introduced into Lake Huron, most likely from ballast water dumped by ocean-going ships.

              
   Ontario's Lake Huron fish management supervisor Dave Reid expects to begin talks soon with four sport fishing groups about potential cuts in the number of fish they plant on the Canadian side. In recent years, Ontario groups have stocked between 500,000 and 700,000 Chinook annually. There was a voluntary 20 per cent stocking reduction in 1999 following an earlier decline in alewife population.

              
   Michigan has moved more quickly than Ontario to make adjustments to biological shifts in Lake Huron. For one thing, much of the research into recent lake changes originates with U.S. Coast Guard and Geological Survey fish sampling conducted annually in Lake Huron.

T1  - Boomtime for Huron's whitefish: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349178562
AB  - Whitefish are prolific, omnivorous creatures, which give them some advantages over other fish species in Lake Huron. During his years of study of lake whitefish, [Andrew Muir] has learned they eat whatever food is available and adapt well to shifts in what's plentiful. That includes such recent non-native arrivals as zebra and quaga mussels.

              
   Muir and many [Nawash] fishermen have become advocates of lake management concepts which favour reliance on wild, native species such as whitefish and lake trout and the end of stocking nursery- raised species, particularly Chinook salmon.

(Phytocoenologia, August 2008) "Restoration Ecology will foster communication and synthesis between those who practice restorations and those who conduct ecological research, particularly in the battlefields of Europe. It is a valuable assessment of work at this exciting interface." (Tree) "Restoration ecology has been likened to battlefield medicine. Actions need to be taken even with imperfect scientific knowledge and practical knowledge develops separately from hard scientific research.

It is a valuable assessment of work at this exciting interface." (Trends in Ecology and Evolution, December 2005) "I suspect that this volume will find its way onto the shelves of many restoration researchers and practitioners and will be used as a key text in graduate courses, where it will help fill a large void. My own copy is already heavily bookmarked, and will be a constant source of research ideas and lecture material." (Environmental Conservation)

T1  - Relationship between anti-oxidant capacity and manganese accumulation in the soft tissues of two freshwater molluscs: Unio pictorum mancus (Lamellibranchia, Unionidae) and Viviparus ater (Gastropoda, Prosobranchia)
AN  - 2417774213
AB  - Manganese is an element of great importance in the life cycle of plants and animals. For example, it plays an essential role as an activator of various enzymatic systems such as isoenzymes of superoxide dismutase. Freshwater Unionidae concentrate relatively large amounts of manganese in their tissues, but little is known about the physiological role of this metal. The aim of this research is to acquire a better knowledge of the role of manganese in molluscs which accumulate large amounts of this metal and in those with low manganese concentrations. As manganese is one of the metals present in the superoxide molecule, the possible relationship between manganese concentration in the soft tissues of molluscs and the antioxidant capacity of the metal can usefully be tested. To this end two species of molluscs were analysed: Unio pictorum mancus (Lamellibranchia, Unionidae), which is very rich in manganese, and Viviparus ater (Gastropoda, Prosobranchia) which has a low manganese content. The adults of both species were analysed for manganese concentration by ICP, and for antioxidant capacity as RAC (Relative Antioxidant Capacity) by a superoxide dismutase method. The results clearly demonstrate the active role played by manganese against free radicals and consequently the important role of the metal in protecting Unio against oxidative stress. The low concentration of manganese in Viviparus may be the result of the effective excretion of this metal, as was found for ruthenium.

T1  - Is pelagic top-down control in lakes augmented by benthic energy pathways?
AN  - 219357777
AB  - Modern food web studies are typically conducted from a trophic dynamic perspective that focuses on combined roles of top-down and bottom-up forces in regulating food web structure. Recognition of spatial food web subsidies in diverse ecosystems highlights the importance of energy flow as a foundation for understanding trophic dynamics. Here, we consider how different energy flow configurations might affect trophic dynamics in north-temperate lakes. A literature review revealed that littoral piscivores exert top-down control on prey fishes. In contrast, analysis of littoral predator diets indicated extensive omnivory and heavy reliance on zoobenthic prey. We explored this uncoupling between trophic dynamics (piscivores regulate prey fish) and energy flow (zoobenthos in piscivore diets) using a biomass dynamic model. This model compared top-down impacts of a piscivore on prey fishes under two scenarios: consumption of prey fish only and consumption of prey fish plus zoobenthos. The model predicted that elimination of zoobenthivory leads to a 50% reduction in piscivore standing stock and concomitant 2.5-fold increase in prey fish abundance (i.e., zoobenthivory plays a key role in mediating pelagic top-down control). These results highlight the role of benthic-pelagic linkages in regulating trophic dynamics and underscore the value of whole-ecosystem approaches to the study of food webs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Thermal histories, stress, and metabolic rates of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in Lake Ontario: evidence from intra-otolith stable isotope analyses
AN  - 219350709
AB  - We describe thermal histories for Lake Ontario chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) as determined from otolith δ^sup 18^O thermometry using computer-controlled micromilling techniques to recover otolith aragonite at subseasonal resolution. We find that during the summer months chinook salmon inhabited epilimnetic waters with temperatures of ~19-20 °C as far back as the late 1980s. Chinook would approach but rarely exceed their reported upper incipient lethal limit of approximately 22 °C, which suggests that these fish were seeking water with temperatures as high as was tolerable while otolith growth occurred. These results contrast with expected midsummer temperatures for this cold-water salmonine. Bioenergetic simulations indicate significant stress imposed upon chinook salmon. We estimate consumption to be up to 20% more and gross conversion efficiency 18% less annually relative to nominal simulations where chinook salmon are modeled nearer their preferred temperature, reinforcing previous inferences that the chinook salmon population may be near the limits of sustainability. We also find a strong negative correlation between δ^sup 18^O and δ^sup 13^C values. Therefore, seasonal and ontogenetic variation in δ^sup 13^C values of chinook salmon otoliths appear to be related to metabolic rate during pelagic residence and may provide an indirect method for evaluating field activity and other aspects of fish life history.

T1  - Bioaccumulation potential of organic contaminants in an Arctic marine food web
AN  - 305367838
AB  - A chemical's octanol-water partition coefficient (K OW) and octanol-air partition coefficient (KOA ) are important factors affecting environmental fate and bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This thesis involved an investigation of various organic chemicals (ranging in KOW and  KOA) in a Canadian Arctic marine food web (53° 59'N, 76° 32'W) aimed to (i) determine levels of PCBs, organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), dialkyl phthalate esters (DPEs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in organisms by high resolution gas-chromatography/high resolution mass-spectrometry (HRGC/HRMS), (ii) evaluate the extent of chemical biomagnification and (iii) identify relationships between biomagnification and influential physical-chemical properties such as KOW and  KOA. The results show that recalcitrant Cl5-Cl 7 PCBs (e.g., PCB 153 and 180) typically exhibited the greatest biomagnification potential and continue to be present at parts per million levels in Arctic biota, some 30 years post-regulatory action. Predator-prey biomagnification factors (BMFs) of PCB 180 ranged from approximately 11.5 in male ringed seals, 45.7 in male beluga whales and 106.3 in common eider ducks. Relatively polar chemicals such as β-HCH (log KOW = 3.8) tetrachlorobenzenes (log KOW = 4.5) and β-endosulfan (log  KOW = 3.4) in some cases exhibited substantial biomagnification in seaducks and marine mammals. BMFs of β-HCH ranged from 5.2 in common eider ducks, 26.2 in male ringed seals and 50.5 in male beluga whales. No significant biomagnification of β-HCH was observed in invertebrates and fish, likely due to efficient respiratory elimination via gills to water. Extensive biomagnification of β-HCH in air-breathing animals (birds and marine mammals) is likely due the chemical's high resistance to metabolic transformation and slow respiratory elimination through air-exhalation because of its high KOA, (i.e., log K OA = 8.9). While DPEs and PBDEs were detected at appreciable levels, they appeared to be biotransformed by organisms, demonstrated by very low BMFs and FWMFs compared to recalcitrant PCBs. Further evidence of biotransformation was supported by the detection of primary metabolites, monoalkyl phthalate esters (MPEs) and hydroxylated and methoxylated brominated diphenyl ethers (OH-BDEs/MeO-BDEs). Future regulatory initiatives should include chemical  KOA and the formation of potentially toxic metabolites as criteria for assessing the bioaccumulation potential of POPs.    Keywords. biomagnification, contaminants, POPs,  KOA, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, phthalate esters, metabolites, Arctic, marine, food web, beluga whales

T1  - One fish, two fish, old fish, new fish: Investigating differential distribution of salmon resources in the Pacific Northwest through ancient DNA analysis
AN  - 305355235
AB  - DNA analysis was applied to approximately 60 ancient salmon remains (1200BP) from the archaeological site of Keatley Creek in British Columbia to examine the distribution of Pacific salmon species between housepits. The success rate of DNA extraction was over 90%, yielding three species of Pacific salmon: Chinook, Sockeye and Coho. Accurate salmon species identification using mitochondrial DNA refined theories of economic stratification and differential access to salmon resources at Keatley Creek. Additionally, the unique information made available by ancient DNA analysis offered insight into prehistoric salmon ecology and spawning behaviour in the region.

T1  - Mobilité et géochronologie du PT et du PD dans les sédiments de deux lacs du Québec
TT  - Mobility and Geochronology of PT and PD in the Sediments of Two Quebec Lakes
AN  - 2827704990
AB  - Le platine (Pt) et le palladium (Pd) font partie des composantes actives des convertisseurs catalytiques automobiles installés sur toutes les nouvelles voitures depuis 1975 au Canada et aux États-Unis et depuis les années 1990 en Europe. Ce dispositif s'avère très efficace pour réduire les émissions automobiles nocives comme les NOx, le CO et les HC. Cependant, il est maintenant reconnu que les convertisseurs catalytiques sont responsables d'une contamination en Pt et en Pd des milieux urbains et des zones à proximité de grandes autoroutes. Les connaissances actuelles sur les émissions automobiles de Pt et de Pd indiquent un risque potentiel pour l'humain et l'environnement, mais elles sont incomplètes et ne permettent pas d'en faire une évaluation éclairée.La découverte récente de la contamination en Pt et en Pd de neiges et de glaces au Groenland, à des dizaines de milliers de kilomètres de toute activité humaine significative, a initié un débat sur le transport des émissions des convertisseurs catalytiques automobiles sur de grandes distances par voie atmosphérique. Dans la présente recherche, nous avons prélevé des carottes de sédiment dans deux lacs du Bouclier canadien (Tantaré et Vose) isolés de toute source directe de contamination en vue d'établir la chronologie du dépôt atmosphérique de Pt et de Pd. Les lacs ont été sélectionnés pour simplifier l'interprétation des profils: petit lac de tête, petit rapport de surface du bassin versant sur surface du lac, pas de bouleversements majeurs au cours des 100 dernières années sur le bassin versant et faible activité benthique au site d'échantillonnage. Le lac Tantaré est situé à 40 km au nord de la ville de Québec dans une réserve écologique et le lac Vose est localisé dans le parc Aiguebelle à 25 km de la ville de Rouyn-Noranda, site de la fonderie Home (Noranda Inc.).Nous avons choisi de déterminer le Pt et le Pd par spectrométrie de masse avec plasma à couplage inductif couplée à la dilution isotopique (ICP-IDMS) puisque cette technique offre des limites de détection permettant de mesurer leur niveau naturel. Des interférences spectrales ont cependant compliqué les analyses de sédiments: l'oxyde d'hafnium sur le Pt; le cadmium et les oxydes d'yttrium et de zirconium sur le Pd. Vu l'importance de ces interférences, nous avons utilisé deux méthodes de contrôle des interférences pour attester la robustesse de nos données. Une partie de la solution de chaque échantillon de sédiment était analysée directement et les contributions des interférences au signal de l'élément d'intérêt étaient soustraites (méthode directe) tandis que l'autre partie de la solution subissait une extraction sur une résine échangeuse d'anions (méthode avec extraction) avant l'analyse ICP-IDMS. Nous avons choisi la résine Aliquat 336/C18 pour sa capacité reconnue d'enlèvement de Hf, pour son élution ne demandant qu'un petit volume d'éluant (possibilité de pré concentration de l'élément d'intérêt) et pour son potentiel d'extraire le Pd et d'enlever ses interférences dans les mêmes conditions que pour le Pt. Préalablement à l'analyse des échantillons de sédiment, tout le processus analytique des deux méthodes a été validé par des essais sur des solutions synthétiques et des matériaux de référence certifiés (BCR-723, une poussière de route et GPt-7, un sol). Nous avons constaté que la résine Aliquat 336/C18 permet d'extraire le Pt et le Pd efficacement tout en enlevant la majorité de Hf, Y et Zr. Cependant, la résine ne permet pas d'enlever le Cd qui interfère avec le dosage du Pd.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerPlatinum (Pt) and palladium (Pd) are part of the active components of automotive catalytic converters installed on all new cars since 1975 in Canada and the United States and since the 1990s in Europe. This device is very effective in reducing harmful automotive emissions such as NOx, CO and HC. However, it is now recognized that catalytic converters are responsible for Pt and Pd contamination of urban environments and areas near major highways. Current knowledge of automobile emissions of Pt and Pd indicates a potential risk for humans and the environment, but it is incomplete and does not allow an informed assessment to be made.The recent discovery of Pt and Pd contamination of snow and ice in Greenland, tens of thousands of kilometers from any significant human activity, has initiated a debate on the transport of emissions from automotive catalytic converters over long distances by atmospheric route. In this research, we collected sediment cores from two lakes in the Canadian Shield (Tantaré and Vose) isolated from any direct source of contamination in order to establish the chronology of the atmospheric deposition of Pt and Pd. The lakes were selected to simplify the interpretation of the profiles: small headwater lake, small watershed surface area to lake surface ratio, no major upheavals in the last 100 years on the watershed and low benthic activity at the site sampling. Tantaré Lake is located 40 km north of Quebec City in an ecological reserve and Vose Lake is located in Aiguebelle Park 25 km from the city of Rouyn-Noranda, site of the Home smelter (Noranda Inc.) .We chose to determine Pt and Pd by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma coupled to isotopic dilution (ICP-IDMS) since this technique offers detection limits allowing their natural level to be measured. Spectral interferences, however, complicated sediment analyses: hafnium oxide on Pt; cadmium and yttrium and zirconium oxides on Pd. Given the importance of these interferences, we used two interference control methods to attest to the robustness of our data. A portion of the solution from each sediment sample was analyzed directly and the interference contributions to the signal of the element of interest were subtracted (direct method) while the other portion of the solution was extracted on a d-exchange resin. anions (extraction method) before ICP-IDMS analysis. We chose the Aliquat 336/C18 resin for its recognized ability to remove Hf, for its elution requiring only a small volume of eluent (possibility of pre-concentration of the element of interest) and for its potential for extract Pd and remove its interferences under the same conditions as for Pt. Prior to the analysis of the sediment samples, the entire analytical process of the two methods was validated by tests on synthetic solutions and certified reference (BCR-723, road dust and GPt-7, soil). We have found that Aliquat 336/C18 resin extracts Pt and Pd efficiently while removing the majority of Hf, Y and Zr. However, the resin does not make it possible to remove the Cd which interferes with the determination of the Pd.

T1  - Seawifs Algorithm for Mapping Phycocyanin in Incipient Freshwater Cyanobacterial Blooms
AN  - 2029056734
AB  - Toxin-producing blooms of cyanobacteria in most freshwater systems have posed a serious global threat throughout the world. Vincent et al. (2004) have developed a set of algorithms that employ LANDSAT 7 ETM+ data and LANDSAT 5 TM data to map cyanobacterial blooms in fresh water lakes from space by quantitatively mapping phycocyanin, the pigment most uniquely associated with cyanobacterial blooms. However, the LANDSAT TM sensor has a 16-day revisit cycle and a spatial resolution of 28.5 m, whereas the SeaWiFS sensor has a daily revisit cycle and a coarse spatial resolution of 1.1 km for LAC (local area coverage) and 4.5 km for GAC (global area coverage). Hence, the SeaWiFS sensor can be applied with higher temporal frequency and can be used to document large-scale changes in the region, due to its larger synoptic coverage. In this research an algorithm has been developed for detecting incipient cyanobacterial blooms with SeaWiFS data that is also based on phycocyanin pigment. An empirical method for atmospheric correction, ratio normalization, has been applied to SeaWiFS data after additive offset of the sensor and atmospheric haze have been corrected by dark object subtraction, which is primarily aimed at making two input images similar with respect to radiometric qualities. It has been observed that ratio normalization becomes more important for coarse resolution sensors such as SeaWiFS (due to their synoptic coverage) than that of sensors like LANDSAT TM.   The results were compared to the LANDSAT TM results and observed that SeaWiFS model predicts phycocyanin concentration about as well as the LANDSAT TM spectral ratio model. To ensure that we are mapping phycocyanin and not chlorophyll a (Chl a), a model for Chl a has been developed from SeaWiFS data. The Chl a model was then applied to the same dates of SeaWiFS data to which the phycocyanin model was applied and the two models results were compared, which brought to view that no correlation exists between phycocyanin and Chl a concentration. This cyanobacterial bloom algorithm with SeaWiFS Data can be used to investigate inter and intra-annual variability of cyanobacterial blooms in the entire Lake Erie. The algorithm could serve as a tool for early stage monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms, thereby assisting future assessment of water quality and the aquatic ecosystem health of large fresh water lakes around the globe.

T1  - Changes in the crustacean communities of Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie following the invasion of the predatory cladoceran Bythotrephes longimanus
AN  - 219305597
AB  - The crustacean zooplankton communities in Lakes Michigan and Huron and the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie have shown substantial, persistent changes since the invasion of the predatory cladoceran Bythotrephes in the mid-1980s. A number of cladoceran species have declined dramatically since the invasion, including Eubosmina coregoni, Holopedium gibberum, Daphnia retrocurva, Daphnia pulicaria, and Leptodora kindti, and overall species richness has decreased as a result. Copepods have been relatively unaffected, with the notable exception of Mesocyclops edax, which has virtually disappeared from the lakes. These species shifts have for the most part been consistent and equally pronounced across all three lakes. Responses of crustacean species to the Bythotrephes invasion do not appear to be solely a consequence of size, and it is likely that other factors, e.g., morphology, vertical distribution, or escape responses, are important determinants of vulnerability to prdation. Our results indicate that invertebrate predators in general, and invasive ones in particular, can have pronounced, lasting effects on zooplankton community structure. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Antarctic Ecosystems:&nbsp;Environmental Contamination, Climate Change, and Human Impact
AN  - 2147624566
AB  - Environmental problems such as the ozone hole and the break-up of ice-shelves have shown that Antarctica is inextricably linked to global processes and exposed to the impact of human activities in the rest of the world. This volume provides an overview of climate change data, its effects on the structure and functioning of Antarctic ecosystems, and the occurrence and cycling of persistent contaminants. It discusses the unique physico-chemical characteristics of the Antarctic environment, ecophysiological adaptations of terrestrial and marine organisms, the transfer of contaminants in pelagic and neritic food chains and the possible consequences for animals at higher trophic levels. The text concludes with possible future scenarios of climate change and atmospheric contamination and the role of Antarctic organisms in the early detection of environmental perturbations.Provides an overview of the unique Antarctic environment, the functioning of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and the occurrence and cycling of persistent contaminants Discusses the role of Antarctic research for the protection of the global environment Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras

T1  - Carp stopped cold in Great Lakes: [Final Edition]
AN  - 267103843
AB  - "Historical patterns of invasion suggest this species is at the northern limit of its ability to invade and is unlikely to become very abundant,'' says a draft version of a report prepared for the federal Fisheries Department. "From this analysis it appears that it is unlikely for grass carp to set up self-sustaining populations based on the environment of the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River.''                 The Great Lakes have already been hit with several other invading species, including zebra mussels. There are an estimated 26 foreign fish species now thriving in the Great Lakes.

T1  - A kinder, gentler cottage: Don't let lawn love and carelessness ruin your retreat: [Final Edition]
AN  - 240760116
AB  - You don't have to explain that to Terry Rees. The Peterborough resident summers on nearby Lake Kasshabog, a relatively small lake surrounded by about 600 cottages. Rees, who is executive director of the Federation of Ontario Cottagers' Associations (FOCA), has watched as zebra mussels ruined a lake next to his. So far, only a few mussels have been discovered in Lake Kasshabog, but Rees remains concerned.                 When it comes to the fixation many cottagers seem to have with lawns, Rees agrees with other experts that "benign neglect" is probably the best route to follow when "landscaping." Fertilizing the lawn and using pesticides are big no-no's, as most chemicals will make their way into the lake, causing untold damage by increasing the nutrient load and adding toxins. "I go to the cottage not to bring nature into submission, but to relax and enjoy it," Rees says. He calls it "the hammock approach" to cottaging.                 PWCs, the high-powered, whining fun-craft that have divided lake associations and embittered neighbourly relations on countless lakes and rivers across Canada, are a sticky problem for groups such as FOCA, which represent a wide range of cottagers with varying ideas of what fun on the water entails. It was the third time [Mira Spivak] had introduced the bill or ones like it, only to see them killed by election calls. This time, Spivak was encouraged to see theproposed legislation supported by Conservatives and the NDP, but says she doesn't think the Liberal majority would have passed it into law. Undeterred, she says she'll introduce it a fourth time, and remains adamant that PWCs are among the worst polluters because of the way they are driven.

T1  - Fighting a Great Lakes invader: [Final Edition]
AN  - 361347577
AB  - He has caught 10 to 15 of the unwanted fish every day during a bass tournament. He has had to tell kids during an event in Port Dalhousie their hooked gobies didn't count towards their totals. And he would see huge gobies 15 to 20 centimetres benefiting from the Great Lakes food chain.

              
   Invaders can change the environment in a way that's favourable to another invader, he said. When the round goby entered the Great Lakes shortly after zebra mussels, it found itself surrounded by its most common prey with very few competitors, [Anthony Ricciardi] said.

              
   The impact of even one invader can have a huge chain reaction. The goby is the link, for instance, between the toxins that zebra mussels carry and the tens of thousands of birds that are washing up on Great Lakes shores with avian botulism.

AN  - 2131038599
AB  - Less expensive and more environmentally appropriate than conventional engineering approaches, constructed ecosystems are a promising technology for environmental problem solving. Undergraduates, graduate students, and working professionals need an introductory text that details the biology and ecology of this rapidly developing discipline, known as ecological engineering. Ecological Engineering: Principles and Practice fills this need by describing ecological concepts and theory and demonstrating their application to constructed ecosystems. It presents highly visible and widespread applications of ecological engineering, including treatment wetlands, microcosms, composting systems, restoration ecology, soil bioengineering, and invasive species control.

T1  - On the Brink:&nbsp;The Great Lakes in the 21st Century
AN  - 2131359457
AB  - As one of the world's great natural treasures, the Great Lakes have also served in recent decades as an early warning system for many emerging environmental problems. In the early twenty-first century, as the Lakes face unprecedented challenges, we need to revisit both the wonder of the Lakes and the perils plaguing them, and to take action to protect this majestic ecosystem. 
      Dave Dempsey weaves the natural character and phenomena of the Great Lakes and stories of the schemes, calamities, and unusual human residents of the Basin with the history of their environmental exploitation and recovery. Contrasting the incomparable beauty and complexity of the Lakes, and the poetry, folklore, and citizen action they have inspired, with the disasters that short-sighted human folly has inflicted on the ecosystem, Dempsey makes this history both engaging and relevant to today's debates and decisions.
      Underlying the neglectful treatment of the Lakes are two irreconcilable and faulty human assumptions: that the Lakes are a system so big that human beings cannot do great harm to it, and that the Lakes are a resource that can be bent to the will of humankind. Dempsey finds evidence that, despite great changes in the laws governing the Lakes and public attitudes toward them in the last fifty years, government policy and institutions are still dominated by these dangerous attitudes.
      A central theme of 
On the Brink is that citizens, who have displayed an increasing sense of commitment to the Lakes and a growing sense of place, must challenge their leaders to reform Great Lakes institutions. While everything from large-scale water exports to global climate change looms in the future of the Lakes, single-purpose solutions do not suffice--no more than a Band- aid would on a gaping wound. Dempsey shows that it is necessary to create a governing system that reflects the realities of life "on the ground" in communities and that taps into the passion and determination of citizens to protect these treasures.

T1  - Dynamique D'échange de Cadmium entre le Biomoniteur Hexagenia et le Milieu Naturel
TT  - Cadmium Exchange Dynamics between the Hexagenia Biomonitor and the Natural Environment
AN  - 2828646253
AB  - Les organismes biomoniteurs permettent d'estimer la concentration de métal biodisponible dans l'environnement. La larve de l'éphémère Hexagenia limbata a été choisie comme biomoniteur en raison de sa présence dans un grand nombre de lacs et de rivières,de sa facilité d'identification, de son comportement sédentaire qui permet une représentation de la contamination locale et de sa tolérance à de fortes concentrations en métaux traces.Pour que l'utilisation d'un biomoniteur soit efficace, il est avantageux de connaître son temps de réponse à un changement dans les concentrations d'un métal et ce, idéalement dans la nature. De cette façon, on peut mieux interpréter les concentrations de métaux mesurés chez le biomoniteur et ainsi prédire son temps de réponse lors d'un changement des concentrations de ce métal dans l'environnement.Pour mesurer les taux d'échange de cadmium (Cd) dans la nature, nous avons effectué une transplantation réciproque de larves de l'éphémère Hexagenia limbata entre deux rivières localisées au Québec, soit dans le nord du Québec (Rivière Allard), soit en Abitibi (Rivière Colombière), et possédant des concentrations différentes en Cd. Les mesures des gains et des pertes de Cd se sont effectuées sur une période de 36 jours dans deux organes, le tractus digestif et le corps, et dans plusieurs fractions cellulaires(isolées par centrifugation différentielle).Dans le cas des larves transplantées vers la rivière Allard, nous avons observé un accroissement de la concentration en Cd dans le temps, une accumulation principale du Cd dans le tractus intestinal et une localisation du Cd dans la fraction subcellulaire des peptides et des protéines stables à la chaleur. Dans le cas des larves transplantées vers la rivière Colombière, nous avons observé une diminution des concentrations en Cd dans le tractus intestinal et que la perte en Cd s'est manifestée principalement dans la fraction des protéines stables à la chaleur. Si la fraction des protéines stables à la chaleur contient majoritairement de la métallothionéine, comme montré chez d'autres espèces aquatiques, on peut supposer qu'une augmentation de la part de Cd fixée à cette fraction relativement aux autres, serait liée à une synthèse accrue de métallothionéines, donc à la mise en place d'un système de protection et/ou détoxication. De plus, ces résultats suggèrent que la métallothionéine soit rapidement recyclée chez cet organisme.Les changements dans les concentrations en Cd les plus notables ont été remarqués dans les deux premières semaines de la transplantation, ce qui suggère que H. limbata soit un bon biomoniteur pour les changements en Cd à court terme, contrairement à d'autres invertébrés comme les bivalves d'eau douce, pour qui les échanges de Cd avec leur environnement sont plus lents. De plus, un modèle mathématique à un compartiment explique avec succès les données obtenues lors de la transplantation et les constantes obtenues à partir du modèle sont similaires à celles mesurées dans une étude antérieure effectuée en laboratoire avec Hexagenia rigida.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerBiomonitor organisms make it possible to estimate the concentration of bioavailable metal in the environment. The larva of the mayfly Hexagenia limbata was chosen as a biomonitor because of its presence in a large number of lakes and rivers, its ease of identification, its sedentary behavior which allows a representation of local contamination and its tolerance to high concentrations of trace metals.For the use of a biomonitor to be effective, it is advantageous to know its response time to a change in the concentrations of a metal, ideally in nature. In this way, we can better interpret the concentrations of metals measured in the biomonitor and thus predict its response time during a change in the concentrations of this metal in the environment.To measure cadmium (Cd) exchange rates in nature, we performed a reciprocal transplant of larvae of the mayfly Hexagenia limbata between two rivers located in Quebec, either in northern Quebec (Rivière Allard), or in Abitibi (Rivière Colombière), and having different concentrations of Cd. Measurements of gains and losses of Cd were carried out over a period of 36 days in two organs, the digestive tract and the body, and in several cellular fractions (isolated by differential centrifugation).In the case of larvae transplanted to the Allard River, we observed an increase in Cd concentration over time, a main accumulation of Cd in the intestinal tract and a localization of Cd in the subcellular fraction of peptides and proteins stable at the heat. In the case of larvae transplanted to the Colombière River, we observed a decrease in Cd concentrations in the intestinal tract and that the loss of Cd was manifested mainly in the fraction of heat-stable proteins. If the fraction of heat-stable proteins mainly contains metallothionein, as shown in other aquatic species, it can be assumed that an increase in the share of Cd bound to this fraction relative to the others, would be linked to increased synthesis. of metallothioneins, therefore to the establishment of a protection and/or detoxification system. Furthermore, these results suggest that metallothionein is rapidly recycled in this organism.The most notable changes in Cd concentrations were noted within the first two weeks of transplantation, suggesting that H. limbata is a good biomonitor for short-term Cd changes, unlike other invertebrates such as freshwater bivalves, for which Cd exchanges with their environment are slower. In addition, a one-compartment mathematical model successfully explains the data obtained during transplantation and the constants obtained from the model are similar to those measured in a previous laboratory study with Hexagenia rigida.

T1  - Trophic structure and energy flow in backwater lakes of two large floodplain rivers assessed using stable isotopes
AN  - 219288234
AB  - Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes ([delta]^sup 13^C and [delta]^sup 15^N, respectively) were measured for locally abundant primary producers, detritus, aquatic invertebrates, and fish in backwater lakes of two large floodplain rivers in an effort to understand patterns of energy dependence and trophic structure within these habitats. We observed trophic enrichment values for ^sup 15^N that were within the ranges observed for other aquatic systems but were often considerably lower than the 3.4[per thousand] typically assumed in stable isotope studies. Production based on benthic and terrestrial material, combined with planktonic production for larval fish, appears to be an important energy source supporting consumers in backwater lakes of large floodplain rivers. Our isotopic data challenge the conventional wisdom that macrophytes are centrally involved in supplying carbon to aquatic consumers in shallow lakes and that food webs in most lakes are sustained almost exclusively by carbon fixed by phytoplankton.

T1  - Great Lakes need to heal: 160 alien species suck energy from ecosystem, coalition says: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359515415
AB  - They're one symptom of a much greater problem -- an invasion of alien species are threatening the future of the Great Lakes, said Jennifer Nalbone, habitat and biodiversity coordinator for Great Lakes United - an international coalition representing about 200 concerned organizations from both sides of the border.                 "We have to allow the lakes to heal," Nalbone told The Tribune. "The lakes are ecosystems. They will sooner or later stabilize, but they'll probably be different than the lakes we knew 100 years ago because so many species have been reduced or extirpated and so many new species have entered... The lakes will find a stable state if we stop stressing them out."                 All of those invasive species made their way into the Great Lakes as stowaways in the ballast of ocean-going ships over the past century. Only about seven per cent of ships using the lakes come from international locations. It's those ships that brought the invaders.

T1  - Fish threatened: [Final Edition]
AN  - 354684419
AB  - The fish, known as the "pickerel" to droves of anglers during the past century and also known as walleye, appears to be losing its habitat to a bulging population of invading blue gill and black crappie, panfish species that have been multiplying since first noticed in the Kawarthas about 20 years ago.

              
   To find possible solutions that may lead to a turnaround, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters (OFAH) research unit and the Ministry of Natural Resources have launched a two-year project to study pickerel movement and habitat use, OFAH fisheries biologist Dave Brown told The Examiner.

              
   Brown and OFAH fisheries biologist Francine MacDonald said pickerel appear to have "disappeared" from other traditional hot spots in Lake Erie and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario, areas heavy with zebra mussels too.

T1  - Alien species invasion threatens Great Lakes ; Fish, viruses killing wildlife Lake Erie is in 'downward spiral': [Ontario Edition]
AN  - 438615483
AB  - "Lake Erie is the indicator for all the lakes," says Margaret Wooster, executive-director of Great Lakes United, a Buffalo-based environment group. "It's indicating a downward spiral."                 Back in 1819, when the Erie Canal first linked the Hudson River with Lake Ontario, sea lampreys- fierce predators that attach to their victims and suck out their body fluids- wriggled into the lake from their natural home in the Atlantic Ocean. The opening of the Welland Canal gave them a route to Lake Erie and the upper lakes, where they nearly wiped out lake trout and whitefish.                 Second, in deeper parts of the lakes, mussels and other bottom- dwellers ingest the botulism toxin. They're not affected by it. But they, in turn, are eaten by the round goby, a small fish that arrived around 1990 in ballast water and now, in Lake Erie alone, numbers in the billions.

T1  - The Structure and Dynamics of Geographic Ranges
AN  - 2131265772
AB  - A synthesis of present understanding of the structure of the geographic ranges of species, which is a core issue in ecology and biogeography with implications for many of the environmental issues presently facing humankind. -;No species occurs everywhere. Indeed, the majority are absent from most places, and where they do occur they are usually quite rare. Gaston discusses the structure of these distributions - the structure of the geographic ranges of species. Gaston is particularly concerned with the factors that determine the limits to a species' geographic range, how the sizes of those ranges vary, and patterns in that variation. Also considered are the distribution of individuals amongst those sites where a species does occur and what determines that distribution, and some of the practical implications of all these. Both in a pure and applied context, ecologists need a broader perspective on their subject matter than has historically prevailed. This book provides one such perspective. A must have book for any researchers and graduate students studying macroecology, biogeography and conservation biology. -;Overall, the book's structure is straightforward and easy to follow, facilitating the ease with which it can be used as a reference. This volume, however, can also comfortably be read cover to cover, as the writing style is very clear, with almost seamless transitions from one topic to another. It will certainly serve as an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the structure or dynamics of geographic ranges, as it greatly surpasses previous works on these topics in itsthoroughness and clarity. It should do much to advance the field of biogeography, and to provide a context for conservation in a world where the distribution, size, and internal structure of geographic ranges are ever changing. - The Quarterly Review of Biology;... a very stimulating book. The range of cases and sources is impressive: it gives the study weight and provides us with one of the few detailed treatments of this subject. It should appeal to a wide audience. Educators will find ideas about range in one text (and have enough material to demonstrate the key ideas irrespective of location). For those studying the distribution of species this book is an excellent introduction. - TEG News;...evaluating this book brings only positive superlatives to mind. The synthesis flows with ease as if all the links amongst various theories, concepts, and analytical methods were known and obvious.

T1  - Government safety net no match for eco-villains: [Final Edition]
AN  - 254497396
AB  - A dangerous exotic insect, discovered last summer in the western portion of Essex County, has halted his plans. Emerald ash borers -- Asian beetles whose larvae kill ash trees by digging serpentine tunnels barely below the bark -- have invaded thousands of his ash trees and threaten to infest all 70,000 ashes on his farm.                 that quarantine, like many of this country's invasive species control measures, is failing. Even though the CFIA erected signs on major arteries warning people not to transport firewood out of the quarantined zone, officials at Rondeau, Wheatley and Pinery provincial parks stopped hundreds of Essex County campers trying to bring a total of 250 bags of firewood from the quarantine zone to the parks over the Victoria Day weekend.                 The emerald ash borer and the CFIA's race to stem its spread highlight an increasingly serious threat to the region's and the country's ecological and economic survival: A seemingly unstoppable invasion of malignant alien species. Invasive species upset the delicate balance of Canada's ecosystem by preying on native animals and habitats, injuring the industries that rely on them.

T1  - Meltdown of the Lakes Series: Troubled Waters: Great Lakes in Crisis: Chapter 5: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349510301
AB  - Since the mid-1980s a tiny, harmless-looking invaders from the Black Sea has been squatting in the lakes, steadily filtering the murk out of the waters. By 1997, these zebra mussels had cleared so much of lakes that [Kimberly Monk] had a pristine view of shipwrecks like the Sligo -- a St. Catharines-built vessel that sank off Toronto in the 19th century.

              
   Along with the zebra mussel, the round-eyed goby, the Eurasian ruffle and the spiny and fishhook waterfleas are rewriting the book of life in the lakes. They are linked to the startling decline in walleye stocks, an expanding dead zone in the middle of Lake Erie, and the spread of disease that is killing tens of thousands of birds each year. For example, another native of the Black Sea, the round eyed goby, is literally eating the future of bass stocks in the lakes.

AB  - Canada may soon fall behind the United States in taking measures to combat what scientists say is the most critical issue facing the Great Lakes today. While the U.S. Congress is currently debating a new a bill aimed at reducing the introduction of harmful alien species into the lakes, there is no similar legislation being debated in Canada, delegates heard during a Great Lakes Fishery Commission conference held at the Renaissance Fallsview hotel in Niagara Falls Friday. "We have been lobbying the federal government on this issue and I think we have the ears of the MPs. There certainly seems to be an interest there," said Dave Brown, a fisheries biologist with the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. "But we are really 12 to 18 months away from seeing anything." The two-day conference examining issues from the health of Lake Ontario fisheries to aquatic habitats wrapped up Friday afternoon with a short talk by Mike Jones, a biology professor at Michigan State University. Jones urged more action to prevent the introduction of invasive species such as the round-eyed goby and the zebra mussel, which are believed to be connected to a host of ecological problems in the lakes such as the disruption of the food chain and the introduction of disease. The creatures most often enter the basin in the ballast of cargo ships.

T1  - Modeling time-varying growth using a generalized von Bertalanffy model with application to bloater (Coregonus hoyi) growth dynamics in Lake Michigan
AN  - 219336412
AB  - A concurrent increase in lakewide abundance and decrease in size-at-age of bloater (Coregonus hoyi) in Lake Michigan have suggested density-dependent growth regulation. We investigated these temporal patterns by fitting a dynamic von Bertalanffy model and length-weight relationship with time-varying parameters to mean length- and weight-at-ages (ages 1-7) from annual surveys (1965-1999). We modeled yearling length, asymptotic size (L[infinity]), and the parameters of a power relationship between mean weight and mean length ([alpha] and [beta]) as changing slowly over time using a random walk model. The Brody growth coefficient (k) was modeled as a linear function of L[infinity] with year-specific random deviations. Our results support a positive relationship between L[infinity] and k, indicating that under conditions supporting larger asymptotic lengths, individuals approach the asymptote more rapidly. We explored the relationship between year-specific growth parameters and indices of lakewide bloater abundance and found evidence of density-dependent growth. However, in the most recent years, L[infinity] and yearling length have remained low in Lake Michigan despite low bloater abundances, suggesting the occurrence of a fundamental shift in the food web.

T1  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT DEFICIT CONTINUES TO GROW
AN  - 229842801
AB  - The federal government's sustainable development deficit is continuing to grow. This is the conclusion reached by Canada's Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, Johanne Gelinas, in the sixth annual report to be issued by the Commissioner's Office. The Report's main conclusion is quite clear. The federal government is not investing enough -- enough of its human and financial resources; its legislative, regulatory, and economic powers; or its political leadership -- to fulfill its sustainable development commitments. The failure of the government to meet its commitments has serious consequences. It presents potential risks to humans' health and the environment and it costs billions of dollars in damage to the environment. The Report contains six chapters comprised of five audits and a final chapter on the part concerned citizens can play in the process. Chapters one to four focus on the federal government's responsibility to protect the health and well-being of Canadians.

T1  - Environmental History of the World:&nbsp;Humankind's Changing Role in the Community of Life
AN  - 2131743099
AB  - An Environmental History of the World is a concise history, from Ancient to Modern times, of the interaction between human societies and the other forms of life that inhabit our planet. This original work follows a chronological path through the history of mankind, in relationship to ecosystems around the world. Each chapter concentrates on a general period in human history which has been characterised by large scale changes in the relationship of human societies to the biosphere, and gives three case-studies that illustrate the significant patterns occurring at that time. Little environmental or historical knowledge is assumed from the reader in this introduction to environmental history.

T1  - Conservation Medicine:&nbsp;Ecological Health in Practice
AN  - 2131082338
AB  - Conservation medicine is an emerging discipline, focussing on the intersection of ecosystem health, animal health, and human health. Work in the biomedical and veterinary sciences is now being folded into conservation biology; to explore the connections between animal and human health; trace the environmental sources of pathogens and pollutants; develop an understanding of the ecological causes of changes in human and animal health; and understand the consequences of diseases to populations and ecological communities. Conservation Medicine defines this new discipline. It examines ecological health issues from various standpoints, including the emergence and resurgence of infectious disease agents; the increasing impacts of toxic chemicals and hazardous substances; and the health implications of habitat fragmentation and degradation and loss of biodiversity. It will provide a framework to examine the connections between the health of the planet and the health of all species and challenge practitioners and students in the health sciences and natural sciences to think about new, collaborative ways to address ecological health concerns.

T1  - Briefly: [Final Edition]
AN  - 270094039
AB  - Ferosa Bluff, the girl's mother, and Andrew Fedorowicz were seeking to have their convictions overturned. Both are serving sentences of up to life in Utah for first-degree murder, felony sexual abuse of a child and felony child abuse.                 The official said yesterday the test results had been known for some time. Police were led to the area by three men identified by Pakistan television as members of a radical Muslim group, Lashkar-e- Janghvi, with links to al-Qaeda. The three have not been charged in the [Daniel Pearl] case. Pearl disappeared Jan. 23 in Karachi while researching links between Pakistani extremists and Richard C. Reid, arrested in December on a flight from Paris to Miami with explosives in his shoes.                 Environmentalists say large numbers of dead fish and birds are showing up in the lake. And they're warning about a dead zone off the Ohio shoreline as non-native species continue to threaten Lake Erie's ecosystem. They theorize that the lake's current problems could be the result of invasions by foreign species such as zebra mussels and the round Gobi.

T1  - Predicting Invasions of Nonindigenous Plants and Plant Pests
AN  - 2131130527
AB  - Nonindigenous plants and plant pests that find their way to the United States and become invasive can often cause problems. They cost more than $100 billion per year in crop and timber losses plus the expense of herbicides and pesticides. And this figure does not include the costs of invasions in less intensively managed ecosystems such as wetlands. 

Nonindigenous Plants and Plant Pests examines this growing problem and offers recommendations for enhancing the science base in this field, improving our detection of potential invaders, and refining our ability to predict their impact. 
The book analyzes the factors that shape an invader's progress through four stages: arriving through one of many possible ports of entry, reaching a threshold of survival, thriving through proliferation and geographic spread, and ultimate impact on the organism's new environment. The book also reviews approaches to predicting whether a species will become an invader as well as the more complex challenge of predicting and measuring its impact on the environment, a process involving value judgments and risk assessment. 
This detailed analysis will be of interest to policymakers, plant scientists, agricultural producers, environmentalists, and public agencies concerned with invasive plant and plant pest species.

T1  - Le Biomoniteur Chaoborus: Influence de la Température et des Variables Biologiques sur la Bioaccumulation du Cadmium
TT  - The Chaoborus Biomonitor: Influence of Temperature and Biological Variables on Cadmium Bioaccumulation
AN  - 2814006427
AB  - Les activités industrielles ont contribué à disperser dans l'environnement lacustre d'importantes quantités de contaminants inorganiques comme le cuivre, le zinc, le plomb, le nickel et le cadmium. Ces métaux sont reconnus pour s'accumuler dans les organismes et provoquer des effets toxiques pouvant nuire tant à leur développement qu'à leur survie. La détermination du niveau de contamination en métaux des écosystèmes permet donc d'évaluer les risques qu'encourent les organismes exposés. Or, il s'avère possible d'estimer le niveau de contamination des systèmes lacustres en mesurant directement les concentrations de métal dans les organismes aquatiques. Dans le cas du Cd, l'accumulation de ce métal par les larves de l'insecte Chaoborus punctipennis peut être raisonnablement bien prédite par les concentrations de Cd libre dans le milieu en se basant sur le modèle théorique de l'ion libre et en prenant en considération la compétition entre les protons et les ions libres de Cd pour les sites d'absorption biologique.Afin de vérifier si les concentrations en Cd de ce biomoniteur reflétaient également les changements temporels survenus dans la qualité des eaux, nous avons mesuré les concentrations de ce métal sur un intervalle de 13 ans dans des lacs situés près de fonderies. Nos résultats ont montré que la réduction des concentrations en Cd dans l'eau de certains lacs s'était soldée par un accroissement des concentrations de Cd chez Chaoborus. Nous avons expliqué ces résultats contradictoires à la logique (i.e., l'amélioration de la qualité d'un milieu devrait se répercuter sur les organismes qui y vivent) par le fait que les diminutions marquées dans les concentrations de protons ont réduit la compétition entre les ions H⁺ et Cd²⁺ pour les sites d'absorption membranaire. Les organismes de ces lacs ont donc accumulé plus de Cd en dépit des concentrations relativement plus faibles de ce métal dans le milieu, ce qui suggère que les risques d'effets toxiques pourraient s'être accrus dans certains lacs se rétablissant de la contamination métallique.Dans un second projet, nous avons testé l'hypothèse selon laquelle les concentrations de Cd chez ce biomoniteur devaient être directement reliées aux concentrations en Cd de ses proies (les organismes zooplanctoniques) puisque la nourriture constitue la voie d'entrée majeure du Cd chez les larves de cet insecte prédateur. La vérification de cette hypothèse a nécessité l'échantillonnage et le dosage du Cd dans Chaoborus et ses proies potentielles provenant d'Me vaste série de lacs du Bouclier Canadien. Nos résultats ont montré que les concentrations de Cd mesurées dans ce prédateur n'étaient pas reliées aux concentrations de Cd retrouvées dans des assemblages de proies fractionnées (ou non) en regard de la taille des organismes présents. Les concentrations de Cd chez Chaoborus étaient par ailleurs significativement corrélées aux concentrations de Cd mesurées chez deux groupes majeurs de proies, i.e., les c1adocères et les copépodes. Conformément au modèle de l'ion libre, nous avons de plus démontré que les concentrations en Cd des proies de Chaoborus étaient significativement reliées aux concentrations en Cd libre du milieu.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerIndustrial activities have contributed to dispersing large quantities of inorganic contaminants such as copper, zinc, lead, nickel and cadmium into the lake environment. These metals are known to accumulate in organisms and cause toxic effects that can harm both their development and their survival. Determining the level of metal contamination in ecosystems therefore makes it possible to assess the risks incurred by the exposed organisms. However, it is possible to estimate the level of contamination of lake systems by directly measuring metal concentrations in aquatic organisms. In the case of Cd, the accumulation of this metal by the larvae of the insect Chaoborus punctipennis can be reasonably well predicted by the concentrations of free Cd in the medium based on the theoretical model of the free ion and taking into consideration the competition between protons and free Cd ions for biological uptake sites.In order to verify whether the Cd concentrations of this biomonitor also reflected temporal changes in water quality, we measured the concentrations of this metal over a 13-year interval in lakes located near smelters. Our results showed that the reduction of Cd concentrations in the water of some lakes resulted in an increase of Cd concentrations in Chaoborus. We explained these contradictory results to logic (i.e., improving the quality of an environment should affect the organisms that live there) by the fact that the marked decreases in the concentrations of protons reduced the competition between the H⁺ and Cd²⁺ ions for membrane absorption sites. Organisms in these lakes therefore accumulated more Cd despite relatively lower concentrations of this metal in the environment, suggesting that the risk of toxic effects may have increased in some lakes recovering from metal contamination.In a second project, we tested the hypothesis according to which the Cd concentrations in this biomonitor should be directly related to the Cd concentrations of its prey (zooplanktonic organisms) since food constitutes the major entry route for Cd in larvae of this predatory insect. Testing this hypothesis required sampling and Cd assay in Chaoborus and its potential prey from a large series of Canadian Shield lakes. Our results showed that the Cd concentrations measured in this predator were not related to the Cd concentrations found in fractionated (or not) prey assemblages with respect to the size of the organisms present. Cd concentrations in Chaoborus were also significantly correlated with Cd concentrations measured in two major prey groups, i.e., c1adocerans and copepods. In accordance with the free ion model, we also demonstrated that the Cd concentrations of Chaoborus prey were significantly related to the free Cd concentrations of the environment.

T1  - Animal Domestication and Behavior
AN  - 2131973680
AB  - This text synthesizes existing knowledge of the process of domestication and how domestication has affected the behaviour of captive wild and domesticated animals, including both farm, zoo and companion animals. Three broad themes are addressed: genetic contributions to the process of domestication; experimental contributions to the process of domestication; the process of feraliztion (i.e. the adaptation of domesticated animals when returned to their natural habitat.

T1  - Lake Ontario easing off environmental critical list: [Final Edition]
AN  - 270068998
AB  - "I would say the patient is improving, but is still in need of treatment," said John Mills, Environment Canada's director general for Ontario as he prepared to meet tonight with counterparts in the Ontario Ministry of Environment, United States Environmental Protection Agency and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.                 He said concentrations of some of the more hazardous chemicals like DDT and PCBs have declined dramatically in salmon and trout since their manufacture was banned in Canada and the U.S. in the 1970s.

T1  - Using Aldo Leopold's land ethic to read environmental history: The case of the Keweenaw forest
AN  - 219869599
AB  - Aldo Leopold's notion of a land ethic provides a useful conceptual framework for interpreting environmental histories, which in turn may be used to plan more effective land use policies for the future. A Leopoldian framework is used as a heuristic device to interpret the environmental history of the land in one small place - the Keweenaw Peninsula of northern Michigan - where successive human purposes altered the landscape dramatically over time. The historical roles that power relations and the land ethic have played in land use and land health are identified. The article concludes by identifying he need for community action based in a land ethic to maintain a healthy forest through sustainable use. Although it is unlikely the Keweenaw forest will return to its preindustrial state, the community can aim for a forest that exemplifies Leopold's qualities of integrity, stability, productivity and beauty.

T1  - Target humans in fish depletion: [Final Edition]
AN  - 352837334
AB  - No doubt cormorants are eating valuable game fish such as pike, bass and pickerel. But the growth of non-native zebra mussels, which eat the phyto-plankton needed by larval fish, can probably be blamed for the most serious reduction of fish stocks in the St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario and soon in the lakes of the Rideau system.

T1  - Disappearance of diporeia spells bad news for whitefish
AN  - 355732256
AB  - Diporeia is a tiny shrimp-like crustacean, about two to four millimetres (an eighth of an inch) long. At one Lake Ontario check station at the depth of 150 metres, the number of diporeia has dropped to 302 per square metre last spring from 2,800 per square metre five years ago.                 Lake Erie was the first to lose its diporeia. In Lake Ontario, the loss was noticed at the Bay of Quinte, about a year after zebra mussels appeared. The diporeia gradually disappeared near the shore and as time went on, they progressively disappeared out into deeper water.                 Diporeia feed on diatoms - minute algae that are prevalent in the spring and fall in deep, cold water and contain oil rather than starch. There's competition between diporeia and zebra mussels for this food, but there seems to be enough to go around.

T1  - Évaluation, optimisation et comparaison des cellules et des colonnes de flottation afin de retirer des contaminants organiques de sédiments portuaires
TT  - Evaluation, Optimization and Comparison of Cells and Flotation Columns to Remove Organic Contaminants From Port Sediments
AN  - 2827703048
AB  - La forte croissance de l'activité industrielle au 20e siècle, en Occident en particulier, a contribué à la détérioration de la qualité de l'environnement à plusieurs égards. Ainsi, les zones portuaires constituent aujourd'hui des régions souvent fortement contaminées. Le dragage et l'enfouissement des sédiments contaminés deviennent alors des problèmes très délicats auxquels il convient de trouver des solutions à la fois simples et peu coûteuses. C'est dans cette optique qu'a été développé un procédé de traitement des sédiments contaminés par l'utilisation de technologies minéralurgiques. Ainsi, dans le cadre de ce travail les performances respectives d'une cellule et d'une colonne de flottation ont été évaluées, optimisées à l'aide de la méthode de Taguchi puis comparées afin de déterminer la technologie la plus appropriée pour l'enlèvement des hydrocarbures pétroliers de sédiments contaminés du port de Montréal. Notons que dans le cadre de la réalisation de ces objectifs, une modélisation mathématique a été développée afin de prédire les performances d'une cellule de flottation en mode continu à partir de résultats en mode fournée.Tout d'abord, notons que parmi les variables qui ont été étudiées, celle qui semble avoir le plus d'influence sur les performances autant des cellules que des colonnes est le pourcentage de solides dans la pulpe sur une base massique. Ainsi, dans les conditions optimales, des coefficients d'efficacité et d'enlèvement respectivement de 57,0 % et 76,3 % ont été atteints en colonne alors qu'en cellule un coefficient d'efficacité de 70,4 % et un coefficient d'enlèvement de 83,2 % ont été mesurés. Notons que dans tous les cas les concentrations en hydrocarbures pétroliers des rejets étaient inférieures au critère C du Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Faune du Québec (3500 ppm) et que la masse du concentré représentait au maximum 10 % de la masse de l'alimentation. Bien qu'à prime abord les résultats des essais en cellule semblent supérieurs, notons que ceux-ci ont été réalisés en mode fournée alors que les essais en colonne ont été réalisés en mode continu. Ainsi, sur la base de la modélisation, il semble qu'au contraire les colonnes soient légèrement supérieures aux cellules. L'utilisation des colonnes de flottation est donc suggérée afin de retirer des hydrocarbures pétroliers de sédiments portuaires contaminés.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerThe strong growth of industrial activity in the 20th century, in the West in particular, contributed to the deterioration of the quality of the environment in several respects. Thus, port areas today are often highly contaminated regions. The dredging and burial of contaminated sediments then become very delicate problems for which it is necessary to find solutions that are both simple and inexpensive. It is with this in mind that a process for treating contaminated sediments was developed using mineral processing technologies. Thus, within the framework of this work the respective performances of a cell and a flotation column were evaluated, optimized using the Taguchi method and then compared in order to determine the most appropriate technology for the removal hydrocarbons from contaminated sediments in the Port of Montreal. Note that in the context of achieving these objectives, a mathematical model was developed to predict the performance of a flotation cell in continuous mode from results in batch mode.First of all, note that among the variables that have been studied, the one that seems to have the most influence on the performance of both cells and columns is the percentage of solids in the pulp on a mass basis. Thus, under optimal conditions, efficiency and removal coefficients of 57.0% and 76.3% respectively were achieved in the column, while in the cell an efficiency coefficient of 70.4% and a coefficient of removal of 83.2% were measured. It should be noted that in all cases the concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in the discharges were below criterion C of the Ministry of the Environment and Wildlife of Quebec (3500 ppm) and that the mass of the concentrate represented a maximum of 10% of the mass of the 'food. Although at first sight the results of the cell tests seem superior, it should be noted that these were carried out in batch mode while the column tests were carried out in continuous mode. So, based on the modeling, it seems that on the contrary the columns are slightly larger than the cells. The use of flotation columns is therefore suggested to remove petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated port sediments.

T1  - Spiny water fleas part of steady invasion in our lakes
AN  - 355541776
AB  - Spiny Water Who? Spiny water flea of course! These tiny aquatic crustaceans from Europe are part of a steady stream of invaders, including zebra mussels, round goby and purple loosestrife that have taken the Great Lakes by storm in the past several decades.                 To answer some of these questions, the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters joined forces with York University and the Federation of Ontario Cottagers' Associations to initiate the Spiny Water Who? The Toronto Dominion Friends of the Environment Foundation also provided partial project funding of $25,000 to this innovative effort.                 "To date, we have only qualified the impacts of the invader on one Ontario Lake - Harp lake in the Muskokas," said York University scientist Dr. Normal Yan. "With the help of our lake partners we will be able to determine if widespread changes in the aquatic life of lakes are associated with the spiny water flea."

T1  - Great Lakes under attack: Controls on ballast water studied: [Final Edition]
AN  - 361152202
AB  - "His research points to the fact that the single biggest problem in the Great Lakes is getting worse," said state Senator Ken Sikkema. Sikkema, sponsor of the legislation, criticizes federal control efforts as weak.

              
   The acceleration of invasions could be because the St. Lawrence Seaway opened the entire Great Lakes to foreign ship traffic in 1959, [Anthony Ricciardi] said.

              
   The round goby, native to the same Eurasian regions as the mussels, now thrives in the Great Lakes by eating zebra mussels. The gobies may ultimately help the mussels by keeping their numbers low enough that the mussels don't compete with each other for food, which could cause their numbers to alternately plunge and boom.

T1  - Lake St. Clair not 'area of concern': [Final Edition]
AN  - 254336242
AB  - Environmental groups and others on both sides of the border have been urging such a designation, arguing it would focus government attention and funding on the problem, allow formal public input and place the whole cleanup effort under the spotlight of the IJC. The IJC has been very critical of the lack of government leadership and progress on cleanup efforts for the existing areas of concern, such as the Detroit River and recently asked the two governments to study adding Lake St. Clair to the list.                 The non-native zebra mussel, said one scientist, is now the only mussel in Lake St. Clair, once home to 18 species of mussel -- a "mind-boggling" change to an ecosystem that depends on biodiversity for stability.                 Similar surveys up until a decade ago showed 70 per cent of the angling effort in Lake St. Clair was targeted on walleye, with musky a distant fourth-place at nine per cent. But the latest survey last summer has musky rocketing into the lead at 29 per cent and walleye plummeting to a mere 20 per cent, behind small-mouthed bass and yellow perch.

T1  - The threat of invasive species: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359068725
AB  - Invasive species reach foreign ecosystems in a variety of ways. The ballast water of freighters, for example, is a virtual aquarium of exotic species and is routinely dumped in the harbours of port cities. Grain, lumber, fruit and millions of other goods are shipped around the world every day. These can carry insects, small mammals, plant spores or other organisms that are then released into new areas. Combined with an explosion of global travel, it's easy to see how species can move from place to place.                 Usually imported species, having evolved elsewhere, are unable to gain a foothold in their new habitats and eventually die out. However, humans have altered the planet so much that naturally occurring species are often weakened so that invaders can more readily take hold. What's more, as our climate changes, new regions become habitable for species that were previously limited by temperature or precipitation levels.                 Every species on this planet has a role to play in the functioning of the biosphere as a whole. When introduced species run rampant and displace indigenous species, the result is a loss of biodiversity.

T1  - Cleaning up Lake Erie
AN  - 224241089
AB  - Washington (AP) -- The U.S. government wants to steer more money into ridding Lake Erie of dangerous PCBs, an Environmental Protection Agency official has said.

              
Production of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, was banned in 1979 because of evidence that the toxic compounds caused deformities in fish-eating birds and concern about possible harm to people who eat fish from PCB-tainted waters. PCBs were used as an insulator in electrical equipment.

              
The inventory of problems was part of a multi-year process leading up to a plan instructing U.S. states, and the federal governments of the United States and Canada on what they should be doing for each of the Great Lakes.

T1  - GOBIES CAUGHT IN HAMILTON HARBOUR MULTIPLE CATCHES SHOW SPECIES IS SETTLED AND SPAWNING HERE: [FINAL EDITION]
AN  - 269964081
AB  - Just a few weeks ago the fisheries department and the environment ministry alerted anglers to the goby invasion of Lake Ontario. The fish hails from Russia's Caspian Sea but was brought to Canadian waters in the ballasts of international ships nine years ago. Like zebra mussels, the fish multiply quickly in their new habitat and disrupt the ecosystem. They eat the eggs and offspring of game fish. Millions now live in Lake Erie, but Lake Ontario didn't get its first goby until a year ago.                 Ron Dermott, a biologist with the department of fisheries and oceans at the Canada Centre for Inland Waters in Burlington, said that until Sunday's catch the species was confined to eastern Lake Ontario near the Bay of Quinte and in the St. Catharines area.                 Dermott said the gobies likely came from ships across the harbour and swam over to LaSalle Park. He plans to go there to search for young gobies under rocks along the shoreline.

T1  - ANGLERS ALERTED TO GOBIES BUT LOCAL FISHERMEN SCOFF AT FEDERAL FEARS OF NEW ARRIVAL: [FINAL EDITION]
AN  - 269968644
AB  - "Everybody panicked about the zebra mussel, but I don't think they've done the damage they were expecting." Zebra mussels, another non-indigenous species, have been notorious for clogging water intake pipes. But they have also been credited with cleaning up bodies like Lake Erie and Hamilton Harbour.                 Zebra mussels consume cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with their microscopic plant diet, and gobies eat about 75 of these mussels a day. Since round gobies usually only grow to about 10 centimetres, they are prey for bigger game fish like bass and pike, and there was concern that PCBs could make their way up the food chain to humans.                 Mike Pettigrew owns Caledonia Bait and Tackle and he's worried because gobies grow faster than food fish, such as perch. If the two species spawn at the same time, gobies will eat the perch minnows.

T1  - Federal Developments
AN  - 229846061
AB  - The brief reinforces the EPA's conclusions that emissions from midwestern states contribute significantly to excessive levels of ozone and smog problems in northeastern states. Canadian experience and scientific evidence shows that U.S. sources of NOx emissions also "contribute significantly" to NOx and ozone levels in Canada. Reduction of these emissions should result in significant health benefits not only for Americans, but also Canadians living in eastern Canada. As a result, Canada is urging the U.S. Court of Appeals to conclude that the EPA's conclusion and judgment is sound and to uphold the regulation.

              
The EPA Nitrogen Oxide Emissions Reduction Program (NOx), which goes into effect in 2003, applies to 22 states and the District of Columbia. It will reduce emissions of NOx by 1.1 million tons per year in the affected 22 states and the District of Columbia, and will reduce pollution that is transported across state boundaries and into Canada. Reducing cross-border air pollution will have significant health benefits in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.

              
Canada's positions are already well known by the EPA as, over the last year, the Government has filed two separate submissions to the Agency while the NOx reduction program was under development, and another when the U.S. was tightening their air quality standards. Technical analysis done in Canada has shown that even with a domestic program, reductions in the United States of ground-level ozone and its precursor emissions -- NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) -- are required to resolve Canada's ground-level ozone problems.

T1  - More unwanted species invading our ecosystem: [Final Edition]
AN  - 361371753
AB  - A new alien invader has recently been added to the list of species that has infiltrated Lake Ontario. Cercopagis pengoi is a cousin of the spiny water flea, a type of zooplankton. An unwelcome guest, the c.pengoi is a predator that eats domestic species. It also gets caught on fishing lines and makes it difficult for anglers to reel in their lines. Like most other unwanted species, the c.pengoi originated in Europe. It was first reported in the Brighton- Port Hope area in August 1998.

              
   Alien or exotic species are organisms that have been introduced to habitats where they are not native. Freed from predators, parasites, pathogens and competitors that keep their numbers in check, these species are considered biological pollutants. In the presence of food and a favorable environment, they will often overrun their new habitat and crowd out native species.

              
   Human activity is the primary cause of this alien invasion. Some species, such as purple loosestrife and carp, were intentionally introduced with disastrous results. Other species were accidentally carried here on animals, vehicles, ships, commercial goods and produce. The ballast of international ships, pumped into our waterways, has been identified as a major source of these unwanted guests. Once introduced, they are spread throughout the continent's interior on boats and other recreational vehicles.

T1  - Beware the goby, anglers warned: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349231019
AB  - [Mark Holmes] also said the goby has a taste for zebra mussels, another foreign species changing the face of underwater life in the Great Lakes. Zebra mussels accumulate so many toxins, the goby is threatening to contaminate the food chain by eating them, he said.

              
   Holmes said some anglers are complaining that the goby is so aggressive in eating their bait that it's impossible to catch other types of fish, something he warns may hurt the economies of communities that rely on sport fishing.

              
   [Anne Yagi] said she experimented with a goby at her house for a year and came to the conclusion that the goby will eat just about anything, but will only indulge in zebra mussels if pushed to the point of starvation.

T1  - Effects of Biological and Physicochemical Variables on the Val Ve Movement Responses of Freshwater Bivalves to Manganese, Uranium, Cadmium and Copper
AN  - 3039730885
AB  - The valve movement responses (VMR) of freshwater unionid bivalves to increasing concentrations of total Mn, U, Cd or Cu, under conditions of varying pH and/or dissolved organic carbon (model fulvic acid) concentrations, were experimentally measured using a computer-based data acquisition system. Specifically, Velesunio angasi, from Magela Creek in tropical northern Australia, was exposed to Mn and/or U in synthetic freshwater between pH 5.0 and 6.0, both with and without model FA (3.15 or 7.91 mg L-1). In contrast, Hyridella depressa, from the Hawkesbury-Nepean River in temperate eastern Australia, was exposed to Cd and/or Cu in synthetic freshwater between pH 6.5 and 7.5, both with and without model FA (4.20 or 11.2 mg L-1). Despite differences in bivalve species, geographical location (climate) and water chemistry, valve movement patterns and concentration-response curves were similar for all metals. The results showed that VMR is a quantifiable, sensitive and rapid, realtime endpoint for assessing the toxic effects of metal exposures. For Mn or Cd, VMR was independent (P > 0.05) of pH and/or model FA concentration. In contrast, VMR to U or Cu was highly dependent (P < 0.05) on pH and/or model FA concentration; individuals were more sensitive to U or Cu at low pH and model FA concentrations. Additionally, results from the concentration-response experiments were used to evaluate the free ion activity model (FIAM). Drug-receptor theory was used to develop an extended form of the FIAM to obtain a more rigorous conceptual model. The developed model explains the conditions under which the FIAM will be effective in explaining biological response (BR), but more importantly, precisely quantifies the interaction of metal species at cell receptor sites. Valve movement responses to Mn or Cd were directly proportional to the activity of the free metal ion (Mn2+ or Cd2+), which is consistent with both the original and extended FIAM. In contrast, VMR to U or Cu were regarded as an 'exception' to the original FIAM, since they were a weighted function of the activities of the free metal ion and the 1 :1 metal hydroxide species (UO22+ + UO2OH+ or Cu2+ + CuOH+). However, this result is consistent with the extended FIAM, with BR primarily dependent on the activity of UOl+ or Cu2+, and secondarily dependent on the activity of OH-. Based on the extended FIAM, this study proposes, for the first time, a quantitative method of uncoupling the biological effects of a metal hydroxide species from that of amelioration of the free metal ion by H+. This is a major outcome, since the activities of metal hydroxide and H+cannot be independently varied. Additionally, concentration-response data obtained from the literature, that are considered to be 'exceptions' to the original FIAM, were reexamined and found to be consistent with the extended FIAM. Overall, the extended FIAM provides a potentially more useful tool for evaluating metal-organism interaction than the original FIAM.

AN  - 269870825
AB  - Sparktec makes a machine that emits a loud underwater sonic pulse, a noise which sounds like a kernel of popcorn popping but about a hundred times louder, that is particularly annoying to zebra mussels.                 So far, Sparktec has found that its technology can dislodge zebra mussels in a 550-metre long, 15-cm wide pipe.              Colour Photo: Paul Hourigan, The Spectator Sparktec employees, from left, Clinton Cooper, [Philip Lowry] and Edmund Eng get hands on with the submersible assembly in a test water tank at the Stoney Creek plant.

T1  - Upstream:&nbsp;Salmon and Society in the Pacific Northwest
AN  - 2132074248
AB  - The importance of salmon to the Pacific Northwest--economic, recreational, symbolic--is enormous. Generations ago, salmon were abundant from central California through Idaho, Oregon, and Washington to British Columbia and Alaska. Now they have disappeared from about 40 percent of their historical range. The decline in salmon numbers has been lamented for at least 100 years, but the issue has become more widespread and acute recently.
 The Endangered Species Act has been invoked, federal laws have been passed, and lawsuits have been filed. More than $1 billion has been spent to improve salmon runs--and still the populations decline.
 In this new volume a committee with diverse expertise explores the complications and conflicts surrounding the salmon problem--starting with available data on the status of salmon populations and an illustrative case study from Washington state's Willapa Bay.
 The book offers specific recommendations for salmon rehabilitation that take into account the key role played by genetic variability in salmon survival and the urgent need for habitat protection and management of fishing.
 The committee presents a comprehensive discussion of the salmon problem, with a wealth of informative graphs and charts and the right amount of historical perspective to clarify today's issues, including
 Salmon biology and geography--their life's journey from fresh waters to the sea and back again to spawn, and their interaction with ecosystems along the way. The impacts of human activities--grazing, damming, timber, agriculture, and population and economic growth. Included is a case study of Washington state's Elwha River dam removal project. Values, attitudes, and the conflicting desires for short-term economic gain and long-term environmental health. The committee traces the roots of the salmon problem to the extractive philosophy characterizing management of land and water in the West. The impact of hatcheries, which were introduced to build fish stocks but which have actually harmed the genetic variability that wild stocks need to survive. This book offers something for everyone with an interest in the salmon issue--policymakers and regulators in the United States and Canada; environmental scientists; environmental advocates; natural resource managers; commercial, tribal, and recreational fishers; and concerned residents of the Pacific Northwest.

T1  - Protection essential: [Final Edition]
AN  - 269794421
AB  - At present, 244 species are classified as endangered, threatened or vulnerable. Contributing factors include the loss of key habitats, overharvesting, the introduction of exotic species such as the zebra mussel, the contamination of ecosystems by toxic substances and climate change.                 The list of species at risk includes relatively well-known, much- admired creatures such as the whooping crane, the peregrine falcon, the eastern bluebird, several species of whales, the sea otter and the polar bear. It also comprises some not-so-famous living beings that are significant in their own right.                 Governments can't control nature, but they can try to control the human activities that threaten species. The new legislation would regulate the killing, disturbing or injuring of species at risk, and control the buying, selling and international trafficking of them. Officials would be required to prepare plans for the recovery of an endangered species.

T1  - Be careful out there: It's a bio-invasion: Changes to our global ecosystem have aided in the spread of various diseases and pests: [Final Edition]
AN  - 267529401
AB  - [Chris Bright]'s research found that 40 per cent of the serious insect pests in the United States today are exotic species -- species introduced into ecosystems in which they are not native -- and 30 per cent of the creatures on the official U.S. endangered and threatened list are there at least in part because non-native species have taken over their habit or otherwise jeopardized their existence.                 These creatures often carry infectious organisms that are quickly spread to humans, causing outbreaks of new infectious diseases such as hantavirus and epidemics of afflictions such as tuberculosis, malaria and the plague, once thought conquered.                 HGE has stricken at least a dozen people in the tick-infested suburbs north of New York City in the last several weeks. "We're probably just seeing the tip of the iceberg," said Dr. Johan Bakken an infectious disease specialist at the Duluth Clinic in Duluth, Minn. He has been monitoring the spread of the disease since identifying the first cases in patients from Wisconsin and Minnesota four years ago. A recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association said there is evidence that HGE was caused by a previously unknown species of bacterium.

T1  - Understanding Marine Biodiversity
AN  - 2130977222
AB  - The diversity of marine life is being affected dramatically by fishery operations, chemical pollution and eutrophication, alteration of physical habitat, exotic species invasion, and effects of other human activities. Effective solutions will require an expanded understanding of the patterns and processes that control the diversity of life in the sea.
 Understanding Marine Biodiverity outlines the current state of our knowledge, and propose research agenda on marine biological diversity. This agenda represents a fundamental change in studying the ocean--emphasizing regional research across a range of space and time scales, enhancing the interface between taxonomy and ecology, and linking oceanographic and ecological approaches.
 Highlighted with examples and brief case studies, this volume illustrates the depth and breadth of undescribed marine biodiversity, explores critical environmental issues, advocates the use of regionally defined model systems, and identifies a series of key biodiversity research questions. The authors examine the utility of various research approaches--theory and modeling, retrospective analysis, integration of biotic and oceanographic surveys--and review recent advances in molecular genetics, instrumentation, and sampling techniques applicable to the research agenda. Throughout the book the critical role of taxonomy is emphasized.
 Informative to the scientist and accessible to the policymaker, Understanding Marine Biodiversity will be of specific interest to marine biologists, ecologists, oceanographers, and research administrators, and to government agencies responsible for utilizing, managing, and protecting the oceans.

Generally speaking, Lake Simcoe anglers have rolled with nature's punches, with the exception of muskie monomaniacs.

T1  - Shared waters, shared future: science panel reports
AN  - 345538765
AB  - photo DEVELOPMENT is causing irreversible losses of fish and wildlife habitat in B.C. and Washington marine ar eas. Because of this, the B.C./Washington Marine Science Panel has assigned top priority to habitat protection in the recommendations of a report released Tuesday.                 Wetlands near river mouths are critical nursery and feeding areas for numerous species of fish, shellfish and birds. The abundance of some species also may depend on other factors, but near shore habitat, once lost, is likely to be gone forever. The panel recommends a moratorium on the loss of further near shore estuarine habitat in regions that already have lost more than 30 per cent of historic areas, until further research has clarified the impact of habitat loss and the public has decided how much should be preserved in the long term.                 Once toxic sources have been controlled, the ecosystem recovers within a few years. Future regulation of discharges should be based on a determination of the actual or potential harm, with particular attention being paid to "non-point sources," such as runoff from urban and agricultural areas, as well as to "point sources," from industry or sewage treatment plants. The degree of sewage treatment required varies tremendously. In some locations advanced treatment is required because of fecal contamination of shellfish beds, excessive algal growth from nutrient inputs, or toxic chemicals. In most open water areas, however, the contamination and nutrient problems are minimal and only the reduction of toxic chemical sources is needed.

T1  - Fish processors sink or swim: Companies gobble up competition: [FINAL Edition]
AN  - 254097056
AB  - LEF is aggressively pursuing expansion with plans to double production in the short-term and not look back. It is on the prowl for acquisitions, but they must be compatible, [Harold Derkson] insists. ``We're not about to change our expertise.'' Prior to going public, the company divested itself of real estate and development interests -- anything not related to fish. ``If it doesn't smell like fish, I don't want to see it,'' Derkson said.              Since 1966, nearly a third of the total fish harvested in Ontario waters has been yellow perch. Fishermen follow the fate of yellow perch more closely because it represents nearly two-thirds of the total landed value from 1966 to 1991. It goes for about $2.40 a pound compared to white perch which is worth about 40 cents a pound, [Mike Darnell] said.              The environment has changed in the last five years. Zebra mussels have cleaned the lake, to the detriment of perch which like turbid water. The clearer habitat favors pickerel which are now in abundance and easy to catch. Derkson expects the cycle to tilt again and perch will come back at the expense of pickerel.

T1  - Invading species infest Great Lakes: [Weekend Edition]
AN  - 275322467
AB  - The trend of invading aquatic life is not new, having first been noted in the 1830s when sea lamprey showed up. But invaders seem to be increasing and the count of foreign species moving to the Great Lakes is officially at 139 - and growing.                 Not that you might want to suddenly swap caviar for bug-eyed goby, the only Great Lakes fish with one breast fin. Though they are eaten in Russia where gobies grow to 25 cm, locally gobies are onlyabout 15-cm long.                 Gobies have a taste for zebra mussels, which may be an environmental plus. The stubborn zebra mussels moved into the Great Lakes like most aquatic invaders, by hitchhiking in the ballast water of an ocean-going vessel.

T1  - Federation is recognized for exotic species efforts: [Cambridge Edition]
AN  - 275492275
AB  - These biological invasions pose a serious threat to native species and ecosystem balance because of their rapid population explosion. These non-native species compete with established species for food and space. In addition, predation, interbreeding, infection and an ability to alter habitat are additional stresses exotic organisms put on our native fish and wildlife species.                 Project Purple is an extension of a successful 1992 OFAH program. It employs teams of students who control and research purple loosestrife (lythrum salicaria), a foreign plant that devours hundreds of thousands of wetland acres every year, leaving fish and wildlife homeless. This otherwise beautiful, purple-flowering perennial was brought from Europe in the 1800s and is now found throughout North America. With each plant producing 2.7 million seeds annually, the purple invader quickly takes over an area, displacing native vegetation and the fish and wildlife species that depend on that vegetation for food and shelter.                 Since 1990, when the OFAH brought invading species to the public's attention, the federation has mounted a successful campaign that saw laws passed in 50 municipalities declaring purple loosestrife noxious. Many agencies, including the ministry, have become more active on all invading species, said [Morgan].

T1  - La Métallothionéine dans le Bivalve d'eau Douce Anodonta grandis: Études in Situ du Rôle de Cette Protéine dans la Détoxification des Métaux Traces et son Évaluation Comme Indicateur Biochimique
TT  - Metallothionein in the Freshwater Bivalve Anodonta grandis: In Situ Studies of the Role of This Protein in Trace Metal Detoxification and its Evaluation as a Biochemical Indicator
AN  - 2814020925
AB  - Les mollusques marins et d'eau douce sont reconnus pour leur capacité de bioconcentrer les métaux traces de leur environnement. Leur tolérance à des charges internes élevées de métaux a été attribuée à l'existence d'un mécanisme de détoxification impliquant la capture des espèces métalliques diffusant dans le cytosol par des ligands dédiés à cette fonction. Une candidate possible à cette fonction s'avère être la métallothionéine (MT). TI s'agit d'une protéine de faible poids moléculaire, riche en cystéine, complexant fortement les ions des métaux appartenant aux groupes fi et lm. Bien que les métallothionéines aient été abondamment étudiées en laboratoire, depuis plus de trente ans, et d'autre part, considérant l'ampleur du problème de contamination des milieux aquatiques par les substances toxiques, il est surprenant de constater le peu de connaissances que nous avons sur le comportement de ces protéines chez les organismes aquatiques dans leur milieu naturel. Ce projet s'est voulu une contribution à l'étude des MT en environnement naturel. Les objectifs généraux ont été d'élucider le mécanisme de détoxification impliquant la métallothionéine qui prévaut chez le bivalve d'eau douce Anodonta grandis vivant en milieu contaminé, et d'évaluer le potentiel qu'offre cette protéine comme indicateur biochimique précoce d'exposition et de stress in situ causé par les métaux traces.La première partie de ce projet comportait une étude multi-Iacustre. Des sédiments superficiels oxyques, les eaux sus-jacentes à ces sédiments et des spécimens d'A. grandis ont été prélevés à onze sites lacustres littoraux localisés au long d'un gradient géochimique de pH, de [Cd], de [Cu] et de [Zn]. La région d'étude de Rouyn-Noranda (nord-ouest québécois) est influencée par des activités minières et de fonte de métaux. Les concentrations de MT dans les branchies, les restes et l'organisme entier étaient significativement correlées (P < 0.01) avec les concentrations tissulaires de Cd. En contraste, les corrélations entre les [MT] et les niveaux de Cu ou de Zn restaient faibles ou nulles. Les variations inter-sites des concentrations de MT étaient le mieux reliées avec les concentrations de l'ion libre Cd²⁺ à l'interface eau-sédiment, telles qu'estimées à partir des équilibres de sorption eau- sédiment. Les relations entre les niveaux de métallothionéine et les concentrations totales de métaux dissous au moment de leurs prélèvements, et entre les concentrations sédimentaires de métaux extraits par NH₂0H.HCI, étaient inexistantes. Ces résultats appuient l'hypothèse initiale de cette étude, à savoir que les concentrations tissulaires de métallothionéine répondent de façon dépendante à une disponibilité accrue de métal (dans ce cas le Cd) dans l'environnement, telle que définie par la concentration de l'ion libre Cd²⁺.La seconde partie de ce projet a consisté en une transplantation de spécimens d'A. grandis d'un lac relativement peu contaminé vers un lac très contaminé en Cd et en Zn. Ces lacs affichaient vraisemblablement des conditions écologiques semblables. Cette expérience s'est déroulée de nouveau dans la région de Rouyn-Noranda et s'est étendue sur 400 jours. Nous en avons tiré une évaluation préliminaire de la métallothionéine du bivalve A. grandis comme indicateur biochimique, en nous guidant sur des critères bien établis pour ce genre d'indicateur.Les bivalves transplantés vers le lac le plus contaminé montrèrent un accroissement lent de métallothionéine dans le temps; cet accroissement était correlé avec une augmentation tout aussi lente des concentrations tissulaires de cadmium. Rappelons que cette relation concentration-réponse pour le Cd a été également observée lors de l'étude inter-lacustre. Les variations saisonnières des concentrations de MT dans les bivalves témoins (laissés dans leurs lacs d'origine) étaient modestes, en comparaison avec la hausse régulières en [MT] observée avec les bivalves transplantés. Le tout suggère que les caractéristiques inhérentes à la biologie et à la physiologie d'A. grandis (ex: croissance et développement, reproduction, nutrition) sont moins importantes que les changements en biodisponibilité des métaux traces comme sources de variations des [MT].Après 400 jours, l'apparition de symptômes de toxicité cellulaire dans les branchies des mollusques transplantés (dégradation oxydative des membranes, homéostasie cellulaire du Ca perturbée, détérioration des indices de condition) coïncida avec l'association du Cd avec des ligands de faible poids moléculaire dans le cytosol branchial. Le déclenchement de ces événements cellulaires suggère un rôle central pour la MT dans la détoxification des métaux et dans le maintien en santé des bivalves dans leur environnement naturel.Des effets toxiques au niveau de l'organisme et de la population furent également décelés. Les stades larvaires en développement dans les marsupiums branchiaux des bivalves du lac le plus pollué étaient apparemment affectés par un stress induit par le Cd alors que les adultes du même lac ne semblaient pas être accablés par quelqu'effet toxique.Les connaissances acquises lors de ce projet ont permis de mieux apprécier le potentiel qu'offre la métallothionéine comme indicateur biochimique d'exposition et de toxicité provoquée par les métaux traces toxiques en milieu naturel. Les résultats sont encourageants à cet égard mais conservent un caractère préliminaire; à notre connaissance, peu d'évaluations systématiques in situ de ce genre ont été rapportées dans la littérature. Afin d'exploiter la métallothionéine comme indicateur prédicteur d'exposition et de toxicité, il sera nécessaire d'obtenir une compréhension plus profonde de ses fonctions physiologiques normales et du mécanisme de détoxification dont elle fait partie, dans l'environnement naturel. Ces études devront être effectuées sur l'organisme biomoniteur proposé.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerMarine and freshwater molluscs are recognized for their ability to bioconcentrate trace metals from their environment. Their tolerance to high internal metal loads has been attributed to the existence of a detoxification mechanism involving the capture of metal species diffusing into the cytosol by ligands dedicated to this function. A possible candidate for this function appears to be metallothionein (MT). TI is a protein of low molecular weight, rich in cysteine, strongly complexing ions of metals belonging to groups fi and lm. Although metallothioneins have been extensively studied in the laboratory for more than thirty years, and on the other hand, considering the extent of the problem of contamination of aquatic environments by toxic substances, it is surprising to note the little knowledge that we have on the behavior of these proteins in aquatic organisms in their natural environment. This project was intended as a contribution to the study of TMs in the natural environment. The general objectives were to elucidate the mechanism of detoxification involving metallothionein which prevails in the freshwater bivalve Anodonta grandis living in a contaminated environment, and to evaluate the potential offered by this protein as an early biochemical indicator of exposure and in situ stress caused by trace metals.The first part of this project involved a multi-lake study. Oxic surficial sediments, the waters overlying these sediments, and specimens of A. grandis were collected at eleven littoral lacustrine sites located along a geochemical gradient of pH, [Cd], [Cu] and [Zn]. The Rouyn-Noranda study region (northwestern Quebec) is influenced by mining and metal smelting activities. MT concentrations in gills, remains and whole body were significantly (P < 0.01) correlated with tissue Cd concentrations. In contrast, correlations between [MT] and Cu or Zn levels remained weak or zero. Inter-site variations in MT concentrations were best correlated with free ion Cd²⁺ concentrations at the water-sediment interface, as estimated from water-sediment sorption equilibria. Relationships between metallothionein levels and total dissolved metal concentrations at the time of their sampling, and between sediment concentrations of metals extracted by NH₂0H.HCI, were non-existent. These results support the original hypothesis of this study, that tissue concentrations of metallothionein respond dependently to increased availability of the metal (in this case Cd) in the environment, as defined by the concentration of the Cd²⁺ free ion.The second part of this project consisted of a transplant of specimens of A. grandis from a relatively uncontaminated lake to a lake highly contaminated with Cd and Zn. These lakes likely had similar ecological conditions. This experience took place again in the Rouyn-Noranda region and extended over 400 days. We drew a preliminary evaluation of the bivalve A. grandis metallothionein as a biochemical indicator, guided by well-established criteria for this type of indicator.Bivalves transplanted to the most contaminated lake showed a slow increase in metallothionein over time; this increase was correlated with an equally slow increase in tissue cadmium concentrations. Note that this concentration-response relationship for Cd was also observed during the inter-lacustrine study. Seasonal variations in MT concentrations in control bivalves (left in their home lakes) were modest, compared to the steady rise in [MT] observed with transplanted bivalves. All of this suggests that the characteristics inherent in the biology and physiology of A. grandis (eg growth and development, reproduction, nutrition) are less important than changes in bioavailability of trace metals as sources of [MT] variations.

T1  - Latest invader endangers Lake Erie fish stocks: [FINAL Edition]
AN  - 254047845
AB  - Just as concerns were easing somewhat over the threat to Lake Erie's commercial and sports fishery from the zebra mussel, alarms are being sounded about the spread of the European ruffe.              "The ruffe has the potential to devastate, if not eliminate, most of the fishery for perch in Lake Erie," said Dan Schloesser of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Research Centre based here.              So far, the only Great Lakes' species known to have suffered from the zebra mussel are native clams, said Schloesser. This hasn't aroused much public concern since no commercial and sports fishermen have much interest in the clams.

AB  - " W. T. Edmondson has spent his career answering questions about the ecological impacts of human experiments on lakes in Washington State. In this volume, he recounts these studies and captures from his experiences a larger view of the nature of our environmental problems. . . . While the commentary is wide ranging, the foundation is a personal account of one ecologist's lifetime experience on the dual points of research and public application of that research."--Research and Exploration"W. T. Edmondson, a zoologist, extracts enduring lessons from his more than 50 years of experience in persuading political powers to make use of scientific knowledge when they set about drawing up laws for managing human interventions in the environment. Any scientist who follows in Edmondson's footsteps should benefit from reading this sensitive recounting of political battles."--Garrett Hardin, Pacific Northwest Quarterly

T1  - Scientists take aim at invasion of mussels: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 436228371
AB  - [Jan Spelt] is a mechanical engineering professor who heads a group that has been given about $150,000 by Ontario Hydro, the Ontario Petroleum Association and the provincial government to find ways of controlling the mussels.                 Hydro recently removed 2 tonnes of zebra mussels from a 200- square-metre (2,153-square-foot) pump at its Nanticoke power plant on Lake Erie, [Renata Claudi] said. Hydro will flush the pipes of their 19 power plants on the Great Lakes every 12 hours throughout the summer to combat the mussels, she said.

T1  - Waterfowl in Winter
AN  - 2131098130
AB  - Waterfowl in Winter was first published in 1988. Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions.

The emphasis in research on waterfowl has traditionally focused on breeding as opposed to migrant or wintering birds. Scientists have long been interested in courtship, nest sites, laying, and brood-rearing, and they have also been concerned about losses of eggs, young, nesting hens, and breeding habitats, especially as they have affected the goal of increasing populations. But lately there has been an upsurge of interest and research on the migratory and wintering phases, and this volume offers ample evidence of the knowledge gained.

The authors—105 waterfowl biologists—have contributed 47 chapters that range geographically from Alaska to northern South America, and from the Pacific Northwest to Nova Scotia and Florida. Their subjects include: distributional changes due to human influence; population trends and concerns over less common species; pairing and other behavior that occurs in the wintering areas and is vital to the success of the species; feeding ecology and body condition during winter; new habitats created by such activities as aquaculture and park development; losses of habitat due to development and drainage for alternate uses; lead poisoning and pollutants that are detrimental to waterfowl; habitat management for maintenance of successful populations now and in the future. Also presented are reports of workshop discussions outlining current issues and future research needs.

Preparation of this volume was assisted by an editorial board comprising Bruce J. J. Batt, Robert H. Chabreck, Leigh H. Fredrickson, and Dennis G. Raveling.
