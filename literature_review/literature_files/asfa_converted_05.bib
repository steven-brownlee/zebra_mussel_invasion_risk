	abstract = {The negative impact of plastic accumulation in aquatic ecosystems is a known and undeniable problem. However, while many of the scientific community’s countermeasures against such accumulation target the effects of the most common commodity plastics, the consequences of so-called ‘biodegradable’ plastics in those ecosystems are seldom discussed. After all, though their alleged biodegradability sustains the widespread belief that they are harmless to the environment, because a material’s fate determines its classification as biodegradable or not, many plastics classified as biodegradable do not in fact meet the required norms and standards of biodegradability in aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, during the past five years, the scientific community has shown that the degradation of such plastics can generate bio-microplastics that have effects similar to or worse than those of conventional microplastics (MPs). Against that background, this review details the latest findings regarding how biodegradable plastics can influence aquatic ecosystems and thus cause adverse health effects in living organisms and/or act as vectors of chemical pollutants. Beyond that, it identifies the key aspects of such trends to be investigated in greater depth, including the need to consider a wider variety of biodegradable plastics and to develop systematic methods that allow quantifying and identifying the remains of those pollutants in living species. Other aspects worth considering include the arrival and mobilisation dynamics of MPs in oceans. The ways in which small animals fed by filtering (e.g. red crabs and other zooplankton organisms) move MPs through the water column and into food webs also merit attention, for those MPs are ingested by numerous species at different trophic levels, at which point bioaccumulation in tissues has to be considered as a factor of toxicity. This review closes with a series of recommendations and perspectives for future studies on ‘biodegradable plastics’ in aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Colourimetric detection, a technique where explosives, constituent functional groups, and taggants may be identified by a change in colour of the reagent, is a rapid and accurate detection method of explosives in-field. However, this approach is presumptive, subjective and inherently relies on the user’s ability to distinguish colour changes. Paper-based analytical devices (PADs), using traditional colourimetric detection has overcome some of the limitations of using colourimetric detection alone, and a desirable technique for further development and application in-field.This thesis presents a method for the improved detection of explosives utilising a ‘universal’ paper-based analytical device by using traditional colourimetric detection with concomitant fluorescence quenching; where fluorescent chromophore emissions were diminished in the presence of nitro-containing compounds due to complex formation between the compound and fluorophore.In-situ and microfluidic PADs (µPADs), were designed and optimised to incorporate both colourimetric and fluorescence quenching reagents, used both independently or combined. In-situand µPADs were designed with two viewing wells per µPAD, and quantitative detection was achieved via a novel transmittance detector under both a white and a 310 nm LED light sources; referred throughout as the eBeagle v.3 detector.Pyrene and pyrene with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) formulations were found to have superior detection selectivity ranges of nitro-containing explosives compared to other tested fluorophores, detecting between 8 – 9 of the 16 nitro-containing explosives. The eBeagle v.3 detector compared had a detection range of 0.09 ± 0.05 mg – 5.29 ± 2.55 mg using pyrene and 0.22 ± 0.27 mg – 0.75 ± 0.17 mg using pyrene with SDS, respectively.Five out of nine tested traditional and unconventional colourimetric reagents for the detection of organic and inorganic explosives were feasible usingin-situor microfluidic PADs and were further optimised with pyrene. A ‘universal’ two well µPAD using two concomitantly colourimetric detection reagents was developed; 1) a pyrene-KOH mixture for the detection of eight nitro-containing explosives, and sub-classification of some tertiary nitro-aromatic explosives (tetryl, trinitrotoluene (TNT), and trinitrobenzene (TNB)), and 2) an ammonium titanyl oxalate and a variant of Griess reagent performed sequentially to determine the presence of hydrogen peroxide and nitrite-based explosives, respectively. This approach had an instrumental minimum detectable amount (MDA) range of 0.97 ± 0.85 mg – 1.66 ± 1.39 under white lighting conditions and 0.25 ± 0.12 mg – 0.83 ± 0.55 mg under UV lighting conditions.},

	abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality globally, with the prevalence continuing to rise due to prolonged life expectancy. Many neurodegenerative disorders share a common pathology that involves protein misfolding, aggregation and deposition in the brain. Dietary intake of non-protein amino acids has previously been linked to such proteinopathies, with indirect evidence indicating potential misincorporation of non-protein amino acids into growing protein chains. Phenotypic and proteomic investigations could provide more direct evidence of misincorporation and further elucidate the role that non-protein amino acids may play in neurodegenerative disease. The aim of this work was to determine if non-protein amino acids incorporate into the human proteome at a level detectable by mass spectrometry, with a focus on the amino acids L-DOPA, BMAA, and azetidine 2-carboxylic acid. An enzymatic method for the conversion of tyrosine residues to L-DOPA was successfully developed, providing a basis for studying the incorporation of L-DOPA into proteins. L-DOPA incorporation into proteins was also detected following treatment of human neuronal cells in vitro, with quantitative proteomics revealing activation of the unfolded protein response, evidence of oxidative stress, and changes in pathways involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Meta-analysis of proteomics datasets revealed a significant effect of sample preparation on the oxidation of samples, which could potentially mask true in vivo oxidation. Labelling techniques and mass spectrometer resolution were also found to be important for the identification of unique peptides and modifications, including misincorporated amino acids. The treatment of human neuronal cells with BMAA in vitro induced proteomic changes indicating a profile of toxicity like that previously reported for glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity, but the incorporation of BMAA into proteins was not detected. Conversely, the incorporation of azetidine 2-carboxylic acid into proteins was readily detectable following in vitro treatment of cells, importantly in proteins involved in cell proteostasis. Azetidine 2-carboxylic acid also resulted in quantitative proteomic changes, including an increased abundance of protein folding machinery and a decreased abundance of translational machinery. The significant proteomic changes in neuronal cells following exposure to all three non-protein amino acids investigated indicated changes in pathways potentially related to neurodegeneration and neurotoxicity, indicating a potential role in such pathologies that should be further explored. This thesis also provided direct evidence that certain non-protein amino acids can be incorporated into human proteins at a level detectable by mass spectrometry, paving the way for future studies to further investigate the role of such amino acids in human disease.},

	abstract = {Climate change is accelerating disconnects between snowmelt-driven water supply and downstream demand. Identifying what makes people and places vulnerable to these disconnects can improve understanding of present conditions and help anticipate future changes in water management. This dissertation seeks to understand the potential for increasing disconnects between downstream agriculturally productive regions and their primary water supply—higher elevation, mountainous (upland) environments. We do so by focusing on agriculturally productive regions in the western United States (US) that are heavily reliant on seasonal snowmelt-driven streamflow, and using interdisciplinary tools such as big data, conceptual modeling, social science, and computational hydrology to assess vulnerability from the source (mountains) to demand (agriculture) We find that a process-based framework isolating three dominant mechanisms linking snow to streamflow helps explain changes in snowmelt-driven streamflow in 537 upland catchments throughout the US. We then use a hydrogeological framework and optimized averaging in a subset of our initial 537 catchments, highlighting the critical and often overlooked role of groundwater contributions in high, arid, and deep mountain catchments. Equipped with a more robust understanding of surface water and groundwater supplies in the western US, we then quantify the benefits of adaptation to changing snow resources particularly in hay-dominated agriculturally productive systems with smaller declines in snow relative to reservoir storage. Finally, we derive a flexible approach for expanding vulnerability assessments beyond the mountains and show that robust consideration of multiple aspects of vulnerability requires better measures of the social value of water as well as demand.},

This leech has a disjunctive range in Europe and Eastern Siberia. Here, we estimate the phylogenetic affinities and host range of A. volgensis using a set of DNA sequences (COI and 18S rRNA gene fragments), field observation data, and a review of the body of literature. Based on a time-calibrated Bayesian phylogeny, we show that the European and Siberian lineages of A. volgensis have been separated since the latest Pliocene (mean age = 2.7 Ma). The analysis of available host records indicates that this leech is characterized by a broader host range as it was collected from fish belonging to four families (Acipenseridae, Cyprinidae, Salmonidae, and Esocidae). Conversely, only a few suitable primary hosts (six sturgeons, one cyprinid, and one salmonid fish) were confirmed by earlier research. Moreover, this leech could be considered a facultative mussel-associated species that uses bivalves (duck mussel Anodonta anatina; Unionidae) as shelter. Globally, three other piscicolid leeches have been recorded from the mantle cavity of bivalve molluscs, that is, the freshwater taxa Caspiobdella fadejewi and Alexandrobdella makhrovi, and the marine species Austrobdella coliumicus.},

The present study aimed to disclose the potential toxicological effects of SDS exposure under environmentally relevant concentrations (0, 0.1, 1, 3, and 10 mg L−1) on the physiology and biochemistry (photosynthesis, pigment, and lipid composition, antioxidative systems, and energy balance) of two marine autotrophs: the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and the macroalgae Ulva lactuca. A growth rate (GR) reduction in P. tricornutum was observed with a classic dose-response effect towards the highest applied concentration, while a GR increase occurred in U. lactuca. Regarding photochemistry, the decrease in the fluorescence of the OJIP curves and laser-induced fluorescence allowed a better separation between SDS treatments in U. lactuca compared with P. tricornutum. Although all pigments significantly decreased in U. lactuca at the highest concentrations (except for antheraxanthin), no significant variations occurred in P. tricornutum. On the other hand, changes in fatty acid content were observed in P. tricornutum but not in U. lactuca. In terms of classical biomarker assessment, a dose-effect relationship of individual biomarkers versus SDS dose applied; U. lactuca displayed a higher number of biomarker candidates, including those in distinct metabolic pathways, increasing its usefulness for ecotoxicological applications. By evaluating the potential application of optical and biochemical traits, it was evident that the fatty acid profiles of the different exposure groups are excellent candidates in P. tricornutum, concomitant with the characteristics of this anionic surfactant. On the other hand, the results presented by laser-induced fluorescence and some parameters of PAM fluorometry in U. lactuca may be an advantage in the field, offering non-invasive, fast, easy-to-use, high-throughput screening techniques as excellent tools for ecotoxicology assessment.},

Herein, we report the efficient loading of Pd(II) ions on an eco-safe cellulose-based organic support (CNS), obtained by thermal cross-linking between TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers and branched polyethyleneimine in the presence of citric acid. A 22.7\% w/w Pd-loading on CNS was determined by the ICP-OES technique, while the metal distribution on the xerogel was evidenced by SEM–EDS analysis. XPS analysis confirmed the direct chelation of Pd(II) ions by means of the high number of amino groups present in the network, so that further functionalization of the support with specific ligands was not necessary. The new composite turned to be an efficient heterogeneous pre-catalyst for promoting Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions between aryl halides and phenyl boronic acid in water, obtaining yields higher than 90\% in 30 min, by operating in a microwave reactor at 100 °C and with just 2\% w/w of CNS-Pd catalyst with respect to aryl halides (4.5‰ for Pd). At the end of first reaction cycle, Pd(II) ions on the support resulted in being reduced to Pd(0) while maintaining the same catalytic efficiency. In fact, no leaching was observed at the end of reactions, and five cycles of recycling and reusing of CNS-Pd catalyst provided excellent results in terms of yields and selectivity in the desired products.},

While incorporating nanomaterials is beneficial to developing high-performance biosensors, at the stages of scale-up and disposal, it may lead to the unmanaged release of toxic nanomaterials. Here we attempt to foster connections between the domains of biosensors development and human and environmental toxicology to encourage a holistic approach to the development and scale-up of biosensors. We begin by exploring the toxicity of nanomaterials commonly used in biosensor design. From our analysis, we introduce five factors with a role in nanotoxicity that should be considered at the biosensor development stages to better manage toxicity. Finally, we contextualize the discussion by presenting the relevant stages and routes of exposure in the biosensor life cycle. Our review found little consensus on how the factors presented govern nanomaterial toxicity, especially in composite and alloyed nanomaterials. To bridge the current gap in understanding and mitigate the risks of uncontrolled nanomaterial release, we advocate for greater collaboration through a precautionary One Health approach to future development and a movement towards a circular approach to biosensor use and disposal.},

These proteins are highly conserved and produced in all cellular organisms when exposed to stress. Hsps play a significant role in protein synthesis and homeostasis, as well as in the maintenance of overall health in crustaceans against various internal and external environmental stresses. Recent reports have suggested that enhancing in vivo Hsp levels via non-lethal heat shock, exogenous Hsps, or plant-based compounds, could be a promising strategy used to develop protective immunity in crustaceans against both abiotic and biotic stresses. Hence, Hsps as the agent of being an immune booster and increasing disease resistance will present a significant advancement in reducing stressful conditions in the aquaculture system.},

	abstract = {A monthly survey of the feeding selectivity of Ruditapes philippinarum in the Yalu River Estuary in 2020–2021 was conducted using high-throughput sequencing identification and visual grading technology. The results showed that the most-dominant species in the water of the shellfish culture area and in the stomachs of R. philippinarum was Karlodinium veneficum in those years. The selectivity index (E) indicated that R. philippinarum avoided consuming Bacillariophyta, Chrysophyta and Cryptophyta throughout the year and preferentially consumed Dinophyta and Chlorophyta. In 2020, the annual average biomass of Dinophyta, Bacillariophyta, Chlorophyta, Dictyochophyta, Cryptophyta and Chrysophyta in the stomach contents of R. philippinarum was 54:14:16:1:10:4; it was 41:12:28:0:1:17 in 2021. The annual average biomass ratio of picophytoplankton, nanophytoplankton and microphytoplankton in the stomachs of R. philippinarum was 13:48:39 in 2020; it was 14:66:20 in 2021. R. philippinarum actively fed on nanophytoplankton and avoided picophytoplankton. Among the phytoplankton of different sizes and groups that R. philippinarum prefer to feed, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and organic phosphorus (DOP) have a significant negative effect on the nanophytoplankton community, pH has a positive effect on the Dictyochophyta community and COD and the inorganic nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (DI-N/P) have a significant positive effect on the Chlorophyta community.},

	abstract = {Unio crassus and Unio tumidus mussels were collected at four sampling sites in the Tisza River (Hungary) to investigate their applicability as sentinel species for the biomonitoring of microplastic contamination. Since mussels, as filter feeders, are able to ingest particles only below a physically defined size, it was expected that their sentinel role in rivers is restricted to small particles, including fibers or microfibers. This assumption was confirmed by our results, as fibers were detected as the dominant particles in all the 80 mussel samples investigated. The length and diameter of the fibers changed in the size range of 20–1000 μm and 10–75 μm, respectively. The number of fibers in the individuals originating from the same sampling site was nearly two times higher in Unio tumidus than in Unio crassus and amounted to 2.7–4.9 and 5.2–8.3 items/individual. The fiber/g soft tissue ratio between these species could be characterized by a factor of three. After applying Raman spectrometry, mostly indigo-dyed polyethylene terephthalate and cellulose-based fibers, as well as a few larger (200 um) polyamide fragments, were identified. The microplastic particles stored temporarily by mussels provide only restricted qualitative information on the microplastic load of the Tisza River, and as our observations confirmed, the sampling efficiency of these ‘living sampling devices’ is highly species-specific.},

As a novelty, we managed to visualize the biodistribution of ingested PSMPLs throughout the fly’s body, observing the interactions of such plastics with Drosophila intestinal lumen, and cellular uptake by hemocytes. This study is the first investigation to investigate the various biological effects of the interactions between ingested PSMPLs and heavy metals in Drosophila.AbstractLiving organisms are now constantly exposed to microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPLs), and besides their toxic potential, they can also act as carriers of various hazardous elements such as heavy metals. Therefore, this study explored possible interactions between polystyrene microplastics (PSMPLs) and two metal pollutants: cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and silver nitrate (AgNO3). To better understand the extent of biological effects caused by different sizes of PSMPLs, we conducted in vivo experiments with five doses (from 0.01 to 10 mM) that contained polystyrene particles measuring 4, 10, and 20 µm in size on Drosophila larvae. Additional experiments were performed by exposing larvae to two individual metals, CdCl2 (0.5 mM) and AgNO3 (0.5 mM), as well as combined exposure to PSMPLs (0.01 and 10 mM) and these metals, in an attempt to gain new insight into health risks of such co-exposure. Using transmission electron microscopy imaging, we managed to visualize the biodistribution of ingested PSMPLs throughout the fly’s body, observing the interactions of such plastics with Drosophila intestinal lumen, cellular uptake by gut enterocytes, the passage of plastic particles through the intestinal barrier to leak into the hemolymph, and cellular uptake by hemocytes. Observations detected size and shape changes in the ingested PSMPLs. Egg-to-adult viability screening revealed no significant toxicity upon exposure to individual doses of tested materials; however, the combined exposure to plastic and metal particles induced aggravated genotoxic effects, including intestinal damage, genetic damage, and intracellular oxidative stress (ROS generation), with smaller sized plastic particles + metals (cadmium and silver) causing greater damage.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, plastic materials are extensively used in the agri-food sector for multiple purposes. The end-of-life management of these plastics is an environmental challenge because frequent incomplete recoveries after the crop seasons lead to the accumulation of plastics debris in agricultural waste, which is now recognized as an emerging environmental issue of global concern. However, the effects of plastic debris in agricultural waste undergoing biotreatment have been poorly studied. This study assesses the effects of agricultural plastic waste (APW) (LDPE + LLDPE and EPS) (1.25\% f.w.) on the vermicomposting process (45 days) in terms of earthworm health by measuring biomarker responses and the enzymatic activity and quality/stabilization of the vermicompost obtained. The results showed that exposure to all the plastic materials tested had negative morphological effects on earthworm survival and body biomass. In the vermicomposting process, the changes detected in the enzymatic activity of the vermicompost and the biofilm seemed to affect the degradation rate of earthworms and the microbiome of the substrate, as demonstrated by the low organic matter mineralization in the vermicompost exposed to plastic. Although no significant changes were recorded in several biomarkers, signs of oxidative stress were evidenced throughout the glutathione S-transferase and carboxylesterase activity, mainly involving balanced oxidative stress and xenobiotic resistance systems.},

	abstract = {Sunscreens have become a product based on increasingly complex formulations that include, among many ingredients, a mixture of UV filters to provide optimal sun ultraviolet radiation protection. A significant group of scientific works deals with the impact of UV filters in aquatic media. However, the knowledge of the mechanism and kinetics of the compound’s direct release, fate, and its transformation and interaction with living organisms is necessary to assess its environmental occurrence and behavior and to predict potential and real impacts on the aquatic environment. This review outlines the existing analysis and modeling of the release and behavior of sunscreen’s ingredients in the marine environment, including aquatic organisms. The physical-chemical properties, photodegradation, and release kinetics of particles and chemicals into the water are studied by hydrodynamic and kinetic models. Direct photolysis of chemicals is modeled as pseudo-first-order kinetics, while the indirect pathway by the reaction of sunscreen with reactive oxygen species is described as second-order kinetics. The interaction of UV filters with marine biota is studied mainly by toxicokinetic models, which predict their bio-accumulation in the organisms’ tissues. These models consider the chemicals’ uptake and excretion, as well as their transfer between different internal animal organs, as a first-order kinetic process. The studies analyzed in the present work represent a driver of change for the beauty and personal care industry, in order to seek new ecological alternatives through the application of R\&D tactics.},

	abstract = {The impact of pharmaceuticals on non-target organisms in the environment is of increasing concern and study. Pharmaceuticals and other pollutants are often present as mixtures in an environmental compartment. Studies on the toxicological implications of these drugs on fish, particularly as mixtures at environmentally relevant concentrations, are very limited. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the chronic effects of the anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine (CBZ) and progesterone (P4) at environmentally relevant concentrations, individually and in binary mixtures, applying a suite of biomarkers at the molecular level in zebrafish (Danio rerio). The effects on biotransformation enzymes 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), antioxidant enzymes catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidases (GPxSe and GPxTOT), and glutathione reductase (GR), and markers of damage, such as DNA strand breaks (DNAsb), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lipid peroxidation (LPO), and vitellogenin-like proteins (VTG), were evaluated. Analyses of the biochemical markers indicated that a synergistic dose-ratio-dependent effect of CBZ and P4 in zebrafish occurs after chronic exposure regarding VTG, biotransformation enzymes (EROD, GST), and oxidative stress marker (DNAsb). The results suggest a synergistic effect regarding VTG, thus indicating a high risk to the reproductive success of fish if these pharmaceuticals co-occur.},

	abstract = {Research interest in a non-protein amino acid β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) arose due to the discovery of a connection between exposure to BMAA and the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous reviews on this topic either considered BMAA as a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases or focused on the problems of detecting BMAA in various environmental samples. Our review is devoted to a wide range of fundamental biological problems related to BMAA, including the molecular mechanisms of biological activity of BMAA and the complex relationships between producers of BMAA and the environment in various natural ecosystems. At the beginning, we briefly recall the most important facts about the producers of BMAA (cyanobacteria, microalgae, and bacteria), the pathways of BMAA biosynthesis, and reliable methods of identification of BMAA. The main distinctive feature of our review is a detailed examination of the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of BMAA to living cells. A brand new aspect, not previously discussed in any reviews, is the effect of BMAA on cyanobacterial cells. These recent studies, conducted using transcriptomics and proteomics, revealed potent regulatory effects of BMAA on the basic metabolism and cell development of these ancient photoautotrophic prokaryotes. Exogenous BMAA strongly influences cell differentiation and primary metabolic processes in cyanobacteria, such as nitrogen fixation, photosynthesis, carbon fixation, and various biosynthetic processes involving 2-oxoglutarate and glutamate. Cyanobacteria were found to be more sensitive to exogenous BMAA under nitrogen-limited growth conditions. We suggest a hypothesis that this toxic diaminoacid can be used by phytoplankton organisms as a possible allelopathic tool for controlling the population of cyanobacterial cells during a period of intense competition for nitrogen and other resources in various ecosystems.},

	abstract = {As heavy metals are easy to accumulate and have strong biological toxicity, they pose a potential threat to human health by entering the human body through the cumulative effect of marine life. Land-based input is an important source of heavy metals in the ocean, which has a great influence on coastal water quality. In this study, the spatial distribution characteristics of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Cr, As) in the coastal waters of the desulfurization process outlet of a power plant in Zhanjiang Bay were investigated, and the enrichment behavior of heavy metals by organisms (oysters and barnacles) were also studied. The results showed that, before the seawater desulfurization system was closed, there were high concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and Cr) in the surface seawater near the drainage outlet. The concentrations of these heavy metals in the surface seawater were higher than those in the bottom seawater within 100 m of the drainage outlet. After the seawater desulfurization system was closed, the average concentrations of Cu, Cr and As in seawater at each station decreased by 17.04\%, 37.52\% and 29.53\%, respectively, while the average concentrations of Zn, Cd and Pb increased by 17.05\%, 32.87\% and 48.77\%, respectively. Single factor pollution index (SFI) and bio-concentration factor (BCF) showed that there was a potential high accumulation risk of Zn in oysters and barnacles near the drainage outlet of desulfurization wastewater (0.5 {\textless} SFI {\textless} 1 and BCF {\textgreater} 1000). The SFI and BCF of each metal in oysters and barnacles decreased with the increase in distance from the drainage outlet. Generally, the coastal water quality of desulfurization process drainage area in Zhanjiang Bay were below the class Ⅱof the “Seawater quality standard” (GB 3097-1997) of China. However, the heavy metals content in seawater and organisms near the drainage outlet is slightly higher. This suggested that if the seawater desulfurization process runs for a long time, it will have a negative impact on the coastal water and organisms.},

As a result, contamination of environmental matrices with nanoparticles becomes inevitable, and the understanding of the risk of nanoecotoxicology is getting larger attention. In this context, focusing on the environmental hazards is essential. Hence, this manuscript aims to review the toxic effects of nanoparticles on soil, water, aquatic, and terrestrial organisms.

This study aimed to assess the effect of nutrients on the community composition, size distribution, and diversity of phytoplankton at three contrasting temperature regimes in phosphorus (P)–enriched mesocosms and with different nitrogen (N) availability imitating eutrophic environments. We applied imaging flow cytometry (IFC) to evaluate complex phytoplankton communities changes, particularly size of planktonic cells, biomass, and phytoplankton composition. We found that N enrichment led to the shift in the dominance from the bloom-forming cyanobacteria to the mixed-type blooming by cyanobacteria and green algae. Moreover, the N enrichment stimulated phytoplankton size increase in the high-temperature regime and led to phytoplankton size decrease in lower temperatures. A combination of high temperature and N enrichment resulted in the lowest phytoplankton diversity. Together these findings demonstrate that the net effect of N and P pollution on phytoplankton communities depends on the temperature conditions. These implications are important for forecasting future climate change impacts on the world’s shallow lake ecosystems.},

In opera (IO) results showed higher levels of HMW-PAHs (73 ± 13 ng/g), BTs (90 ± 38 ng Sn/g) and increasing levels of Pb (6.7 ± 0.7 mg/kg) and Zn (73.6 ± 6.08 mg/kg) probably linked to works. Other contaminant alterations, especially metal(loid)s, before (AO) and after (PO) the burial, were attributed to a general condition of the area and mostly unrelated to works. In addition, LT50, MN and TOSCA showed alterations, probably due to hotspots occurring in IO. TOSCA and MDA increases, right after the burial, were considered delayed responses of IO, whilst other biological responses detected later were connected to the general condition of the area. Comparisons between results of Principal Component Analyses (PCAs) highlighted partial overlapping of AO and IO, whilst PO differed only for contaminants.

	abstract = {An apparent proliferation of filamentous algal blooms (FABs) in pristine lakes around the world is a source of concern. However, little is known about the predominant drivers and effects of such FABs on lake ecosystems. We observed FABs in a large clear-water lake (Bear Lake, UT/ID, USA) and analyzed long-term lake monitoring data and algal stable isotopes for changes in climate, food webs and anthropogenic nutrient loading, respectively, as potential local drivers of FAB formation. Furthermore, we quantified in situ metabolism rates on rocks with and without FABs at two locations. Long-term monitoring data revealed increasing summer water temperatures (2009 to 2020) and decreasing winter ice cover (1923 to 2021). The FABs had δ15N values that were higher than 0 ‰, indicating a potential nutrient influx to Bear Lake from livestock or human waste. Climate change and anthropogenic nutrients may thus have facilitated FAB occurrence. Contrary to expectation, the FABs exhibited significantly lower gross primary production rates compared to low-biomass periphyton communities, indicating potentially negative effects of FAB proliferations on lake food webs. Our results highlight the need for expanding lake monitoring programs to include littoral zones to detect and mitigate changes occurring in lakes.},

Some of the highest reported concentrations of microplastics, globally, are in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), which is home to the majority of plastic manufacturers in the United States. A comprehensive understanding of the risk microplastics pose to wildlife is critical to the development of scientifically sound mitigation and policy initiatives. In this review, we synthesize existing knowledge of microplastic debris in the Gulf of Mexico and its effects on birds and make recommendations for further research. The current state of knowledge suggests that microplastics are widespread in the marine environment, come from known sources, and have the potential to be a major ecotoxicological concern for wild birds, especially in areas of high concentration such as the GoM. However, data for GoM birds are currently lacking regarding typical microplastic ingestion rates uptake of chemicals associated with plastics by avian tissues; and physiological, behavioral, and fitness consequences of microplastic ingestion. Filling these knowledge gaps is essential to understand the hazard microplastics pose to wild birds, and to the creation of effective policy actions and widespread mitigation measures to curb this emerging threat to wildlife.},

	abstract = {The pollution of the aquatic environment has become a worldwide problem. The widespread use of pesticides, heavy metals and pharmaceuticals through anthropogenic activities has increased the emission of such contaminants into wastewater. Pharmaceuticals constitute a significant class of aquatic contaminants and can seriously threaten the health of non-target organisms. No strict legal regulations on the consumption and release of pharmaceuticals into water bodies have been implemented on a global scale. Different conventional wastewater treatments are not well-designed to remove emerging contaminants from wastewater with high efficiency. Therefore, particular attention has been paid to the phycoremediation technique, which seems to be a promising choice as a low-cost and environment-friendly wastewater treatment. This technique uses macro- or micro-algae for the removal or biotransformation of pollutants and is constantly being developed to cope with the issue of wastewater contamination. The aims of this review are: (i) to examine the occurrence of pharmaceuticals in water, and their toxicity on non-target organisms and to describe the inefficient conventional wastewater treatments; (ii) present cost-efficient algal-based techniques of contamination removal; (iii) to characterize types of algae cultivation systems; and (iv) to describe the challenges and advantages of phycoremediation.},

Infected larvae originated from field-collected adult females, which were caught in southern Poland in August 2020 (the second half of the flight season). Higher rearing temperatures and the presence of predator cues from the invasive alien signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) increased the number of infected larvae. Infected larvae had distorted wing development, and all individuals died before emergence. Hence, microsporidian infection in I. elegans larvae impacted damselfly morphology and life history. We propose that warming temperature and stress caused by non-consumptive effects triggered by invasive alien predators are possible factors that produce negative fitness consequences following microsporidian infection in a key amphibious ectotherm.},

	abstract = {Objetivo: Nosso objetivo foi descrever a estrutura e os padrões espaciais da comunidade zooplanctônica em um pequeno sistema fluvial brasileiro (sub-bacia do rio Paranaíba) e avaliar o papel de um meandro na dinâmica dessa comunidade. Métodos: Amostras de zooplâncton foram coletadas em pontos localizados em um meandro e no leito do rio Aporé durante os períodos chuvoso e seco. Coletamos essas amostras na superfície e fundo de duas zonas diferentes (litorânea e canal). Para cada período hidrológico, a análise de variância foi conduzida para determinar as diferenças na riqueza de espécies e abundância do zooplâncton entre os diferentes pontos (longitudinal), zonas (lateral) e profundidades (vertical). A análise de cluster foi realizada para avaliar a similaridade na composição de espécies. Além disso, uma análise de correspondência canônica foi usada para selecionar as variáveis ambientais que melhor explicaram a variação nos dados de abundância do zooplâncton. Resultados: Registramos 152 espécies: 70 de rotíferos, 53 de amebas testáceas, 20 de cladóceros e 9 de copépodes. Observamos mudanças na riqueza de espécies e abundância do zooplâncton ao longo do eixo longitudinal do rio tanto no período chuvoso quanto no seco. No entanto, não detectamos nenhuma mudança lateral ou vertical nesses atributos. A análise de cluster também indicou que as maiores diferenças na composição de espécies estavam no eixo longitudinal do rio. A variabilidade longitudinal do zooplâncton foi associada principalmente a influência de um meandro a montante, bem como a mudanças na velocidade de fluxo d'água, turbidez e concentrações de sólidos suspensos à jusante. Conclusões: Nossos resultados demonstraram a importância de uma heterogeneidade de características hidrológicas como fator estruturante da comunidade zooplanctônica no rio Aporé. Assim, destacamos a relevância de ações para proteger e manter as características naturais desses ambientes.Alternate abstract:Aim: Our objective was to describe the structure and spatial patterns of the zooplankton community in a small Brazilian river system (Paranaíba River sub-basin) and evaluate the role of an oxbow lake in the dynamics of this community. Methods: Zooplankton samples were collected from sites located in an oxbow lake and the Aporé River bed during the rainy and dry seasons. We collected these samples from the surface and bottom levels of two different zones (littoral and channel). For each hydrological season, analysis of variance was conducted to determine the differences in species richness and abundance of zooplankton among different sites (longitudinal), zones (lateral), and depths (vertical). Cluster analysis was performed to assess the similarity in species composition. In addition, a canonical correspondence analysis was used to select the environmental variables that best explained the variation in zooplankton abundance data. Results: We recorded 152 species: 70 rotifers, 53 testate amoebae, 20 cladocerans, and 9 copepods. We observed changes in the species richness and abundance of zooplankton along the longitudinal axis of the river in both the rainy and dry seasons. However, we did not detect any lateral or vertical changes in these attributes. Cluster analysis also indicated that the greatest differences in species composition were in the longitudinal axis of the river. The longitudinal variability of zooplankton was mainly associated with the influence of an upstream oxbow lake, as well as the changes in water flow velocity, turbidity, and concentrations of suspended solids downstream. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the importance of a heterogeneity of hydrological characteristics as a structuring factor of the zooplankton community in the Aporé River. Thus, we highlight the relevance of actions to protect and maintain the natural characteristics of these environments.},

Because wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are unable to eradicate PGs after excretion, they are discharged into aquatic systems, where they can also be regenerated from conjugated PG metabolites. This review summarises the concentrations of 12 PGs in waters from 2015 to 2021. The selected PGs were considered of particular interest due to their wide use, activity, and hormonal derivation (from testosterone, progesterone, and spirolactone). We concluded that PGs had been analysed in WWTPs influents and effluents and, to a lesser extent, in other matrices, including surface waters, where their concentrations range from ng/L to a few µg/L. Because of their high affinity for cell hormone receptors, PGs are endocrine disruptor compounds that may alter the reproductive fitness and development of biota. This review focused on their biological effects in fish, which are the most used aquatic model organisms to qualify the impacts of PGs, highlighting the risks that environmental concentrations pose to their health, fecundity, and fertility. It is concluded that PGs research should be expanded because of the still limited data on their environmental concentrations and effects.},

	abstract = {Different types of water bodies in lowland river floodplains represent vital biodiversity havens and encompass diverse microhabitats, which are essential for structuring different macroinvertebrate communities. Chironomidae larvae (Diptera) are an inseparable part of these communities, with their high richness and abundance. In three water body types within the Danube floodplain Kopački Rit in Croatia, over the course of four sampling campaigns, we recorded 51 chironomid taxa in periphyton on macrophytes, twigs, and glass slides. The most diverse were chironomid communities on macrophytes, whilst month-old periphyton on twigs supported the least taxa. Cricotopus gr. sylvestris, Dicrotendipes lobiger, Dicrotendipes spp., Endochironomus albipennis, Glyptotendipes pallens agg., Polypedilum sordens and Polypedilum spp. were present in all studied microhabitats. The type of substrate is a very important factor influencing Chironomidae diversity and abundance, which was evident in the presence and dominance of Corynoneura gr. scutellata and Monopelopia tenuicalcar in the dense macrophyte canopy epiphyton. Finding pristine floodplains such as Kopački Rit can be very challenging, as such areas are increasingly altered by human activities. Studies of resident species and the extent to which changes in the parent river influence floodplain communities are important for the protection and restoration of the floodplains.},

	abstract = {The model of two species competing for a resource proposed by R. May and A.P. Shapiro has not yet been fully explored. We study its dynamic modes. The model reveals complex dynamics: multistable in-phase and out-of-phase cycles, and their bifurcations occur. The multistable out-of-phase dynamic modes can bifurcate via the Neimark–Sacker scenario. A value variation of interspecific competition coefficients changes the number of in-phase and out-of-phase modes. We have suggested an approach to identify the bifurcation (period-doubling, pitchfork, or saddle-node bifurcations) due to which in-phase and out-of-phase periodic points appear. With strong interspecific competition, the population’s survival depends on its growth rate. However, with a specific initial condition, a species with a lower birth rate can displace its competitor with a higher one. With weak interspecific competition and sufficiently high population growth rates, the species coexist. At the same time, the observed dynamic mode or the oscillation phase can change due to altering of the initial condition values. The influence of external factors can be considered as an initial condition modification, leading to dynamics shift due to the coexistence of several stable attractors.},

The recovery techniques for the most challenging colloidal fraction are limited, even for analytical purposes. Here we show how a hygroscopic nanocellulose network acts as an ideal capturing material even for the tiniest nanoplastic particles. We reveal that the entrapment of particles from aqueous environment is primarily a result of the network’s hygroscopic nature - a feature which is further intensified with the high surface area of nanocellulose. We broaden the understanding of the mechanism for particle capture by investigating the influence of pH and ionic strength on the adsorption behaviour. We determine the nanoplastic binding mechanisms using surface sensitive methods, and interpret the results with the random sequential adsorption (RSA) model. These findings hold potential for the explicit quantification of the colloidal nano- and microplastics from different aqueous environments, and eventually, provide solutions to collect them directly on-site where they are produced.Nanoplastic particles in aqueous environments are challenging to quantify and characterize due to a lack of methods to capture and analyze them. Here the authors demonstrate that nanocellulose networks can be used to capture colloidal plastics and quantify them through their fluorescence and adsorption, providing kinetic information on their uptake.},

This literature review discusses the methodologies currently used to measure the most commonly found freshwater cyanotoxins and prymnesins in various matrices and to assess their advantages and limitations. Identifying and quantifying cyanotoxins in surface waters, fish tissue, organs, and other matrices are crucial for risk assessment and for ensuring quality of food and water for consumption and recreational uses. This paper also summarizes currently available tissue extraction, preparation, and detection methods mentioned in previous studies that have quantified toxins in complex matrices. The structural diversity and complexity of many cyanobacterial and algal metabolites further impede accurate quantitation and structural confirmation for various cyanotoxins. Liquid chromatography–triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC–MS/MS) to enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of toxin analysis has become an essential tool for cyanotoxin detection and can potentially be used for the concurrent analysis of multiple toxins.},

	abstract = {Upscaling of ecological effects from indoor microcosms to outdoor mesocosms bridging the gap between controlled laboratory conditions and highly complex natural environments poses several challenges: typical standard water types used in laboratory experiments are not feasible in large outdoor experiments. Additionally, moving from the micro- to meso-scale, biodiversity is enhanced. We performed an indoor microcosm experiment to determine the effects of agricultural run-off (ARO) on a defined benthic–pelagic community comprising primary producers and primary consumers, exposed to ambient summer temperature and +3.5 °C. Treatments were replicated in two water types (standard Volvic and Munich well water). We then scaled up to outdoor mesocosms using an ARO concentration gradient and +3 °C warming above ambient temperature, using Munich well water. We included the same benthic macroorganisms but more complex periphyton and plankton communities. All the functional groups were affected by stressors in the microcosms, and a shift from macrophyte to phytoplankton dominance was observed. While effects were present, they were less pronounced in the mesocosms, where a higher biodiversity may have modified the responses of the system to the stressors. The stressor effects observed in controlled experiments may thus be masked in more complex outdoor experiments, but should not be interpreted as “no effects”.},

	abstract = {With the progressive ageing of the population, the study of the relations between road safety and elderly users is becoming increasingly relevant. Although the decline of pedestrian skills in the elderly has been widely studied in the literature, few studies have been devoted to the contributing built environmental factors of the elderly pedestrian collisions, such as the sidewalk density, the presence of traffic lights, or even some indicator related to land use or the socioeconomic features of the urban fabric. This paper contributes to the limited literature on elderly pedestrian safety by applying a negative binomial regression to a set of built environmental variables to study the occurrence of accidents involving elderly and younger (non-elderly) pedestrians in Madrid (Spain) between 2006 and 2018. The model considers a selection of built environmental factors per city district, linked to land use, infrastructure, and socioeconomic indicators. Results have highlighted that the elderly pedestrian collisions could be avoided with the existence of a wider sidewalk in the district and a greater traffic lights density. Unlike younger pedestrian accidents, these accidents are much more favored in ageing districts with higher traffic flows.},

The physicochemical characteristics of trace elements undergo modifications that can cause reversible genotoxic damage to ichthyofauna. This study aimed to assess the environmental quality of a lagoon (Mãe-Bá) that receives industrial effluents from one of the largest iron ore companies in the world, located in southeastern Brazil. The physicochemical parameters of the lagoon water were analyzed monthly, the trace element levels in the sediment were quantified, and the risk of genotoxic damage to fish was quantified using a micronucleus test and comet assay. We verified the poor environmental quality of the lagoon, and strong anthropic action was evident, with particularly high levels of Cr and Ni and genotoxic damage being observed in fish. It is not possible to state a relationship between the increase in Cr and Ni with the mining company since we found high concentrations of these elements in a reference lagoon (Nova Guarapari) with no connection to the mining company. Even if the bioavailability of the trace elements in the water resource is low or if their concentration is below the permitted limit, their presence can cause genotoxic damage. These findings can enable us to assist in planning suitable remediation strategies to decrease the genotoxic effects observed in these sensitive eco-systems. A multidisciplinary approach is needed in studies involving ecotoxicology to develop conservation strategies for both the biotic and abiotic environments.},

	abstract = {For enhanced public safety and water resource management, a three-dimensional operational lake hydrodynamic forecasting system, COASTLINES (Canadian cOASTal and Lake forecastINg modEl System), was developed. The modeling system is built upon the three-dimensional Aquatic Ecosystem Model (AEM3D) model, with predictive simulation capabilities developed and tested for a large lake (i.e., Lake Erie). The open-access workflow derives model forcing, code execution, post-processing, and web-based visualization of the model outputs, including water level elevations and temperatures, in near-real time. COASTLINES also generates 240 h predictions using atmospheric forcing from 15 and 25 km horizontal-resolution operational meteorological products from the Environment Canada Global Deterministic Forecast System (GDPS). Simulated water levels were validated against observations from six gauge stations, with model error increasing with forecast horizon. Satellite images and lake buoys were used to validate forecast lake surface temperature and the water column thermal stratification. The forecast lake surface temperature is as accurate as hindcasts, with a root-mean-square deviation {\textless}2 ∘C. COASTLINES predicted storm surges and up-/downwelling events that are important for coastal flooding and drinking water/fishery management, respectively. Model forecasts are available in real time at https://coastlines.engineering.queensu.ca/ (last access: January 2022​​​​​​​). This study provides an example of the successful development of an operational forecasting workflow, entirely driven by open-access data, that may be easily adapted to simulate aquatic systems or to drive other computational models, as required for management and public safety.},

The results indicate that HS-derived ARB ({\textgreater}60\%) resisted β-lactams and aminoglycosides and that LS-derived strains resisted macrolide and tetracyclines. All strains resisted 4 or more antibiotics. A total of 542 operational taxonomic units were detected in the samples, with Shewanella, Vibrio, and Endozoicomonas being the dominant genera ({\textgreater}80\%), although distributed differently among the different salinity samples. The oyster microbial richness ranked as MS {\textgreater} LS {\textgreater} HS.

Mytilus first of all, principally determine mussel populations as a powerful natural biofilter. Both marine and freshwater mussels consume relatively large amounts of seston, feeding directly on the primary producers. Particles with contaminants extracted from ambient water during the filtration are accumulated in mussel pseudofaeces and faeces discharged after digestion. These specific particles of faeces and soft pseudofeaces become very suitable substrata for bacteria development with following contaminant destruction. Moreover, such biodeposits appeared to be the nutritious food for bottom detritophages, in particular of polychaetes and amphipods. Some fluid metabolites excreted by mussels, i.e. dissolved organic matter (DOM) have a pronounced biological activity to producers. In general, mussels possess high resistance to acute and chronic pollution stress, although their growth may slow down and even stops. In clean conditions food supply is the most important factor in determining activity and growth rate of mussels for northern environment. Mussel and some other aquaculture, as a relatively new application of environmental engineering is able to improve the recycling of nutrients from wastewater to bioproduction and greatly reduce the risk of environmental degradation in the coastal zone.},

	abstract = {This paper approaches the problem of ballast water treatment in ships. This has been identified as one of the four greatest threats to the world's oceans. Solutions that have been considered for solving the problem are alternative water treatment technologies. In the case study reported in this paper three major water treatment technologies have been evaluated with the help of twenty-six criteria, quantitative as well as qualitative by using two discrete multicriteria methods, TODIM and THOR 2. The THOR 2 consists of the axiomatic evolution of the THOR method and both THOR 2 and THOR are made available through the THOR Web platform. Five groups of evaluation criteria are then considered: practicality; biological effectiveness; cost/benefit ratio; time frame for the implementation of standards; and environmental impact of the process' sub-products. In this paper a case study on choosing a ballast water treatment technology is presented.Three alternative ballast water management technologies are proposed by experts in the field and are evaluated with the help of twenty-six criteria, quantitative as well as qualitative. Each ballast water management method is described by a list of twenty-six attributes or criteria. After setting the problem in a clear way and consulting different experts, the two separate applications of both TODIM and THOR 2 are performed. What is denoted as Management Method \#1 is indeed chosen as the best alternative according to both methods. The conclusion is that those two methods, although conceptually and analytically quite different, lead essentially to the same main results. Two other applications of both TODIM and THOR have indeed confirmed the convergence of results in spite of the conceptual and technical differences between the two methods. This suggests that formulating a decision problem in a correct, clear-cut way can be at least as important as the technical characteristics of the method per se.},

	abstract = {Several potential genotoxins found in water samples arise from anthropogenic activities. Acid mine effluent resulting from coal mining poses serious environment concerns all over the world. The use of toxicity tests to evaluate the quality of streams add value by providing site-specific toxicological data. Treatment systems such as the use of natural wetlands (passive) or conventional physical and chemical pH-neutralised processes (active) are employed mainly to meet certain water quality guidelines. Nonetheless, potential genotoxins or residues remain which influence the quality of discharged effluents. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of acid mine drainage (AMD) released into a natural stream following treatment by passive and active methods. This study aimed to identify the extent of AMD mutagenicity and genotoxicity to African Vero monkey kidney cell line and a fish gill cell line (RTgill-W1) using two assays, the Ames test, and the comet assay, as a rapid and effective screening tool. The Ames test performed without metabolic activation using Salmonella typhimurium TA98 and TA100 strains showed no indication of mutagenicity in the water samples tested. Differing results were however obtained for the comet assay using the African Vero monkey kidney cell line and a fish gill cell line (RTgill-W1), which revealed DNA fragmentation and variations in morphologies indicative of genotoxicity in the water samples following the two treatment processes. A significant reduction in DNA damage was observed in water samples following active treatment of the AMD, evidenced by reduced damage frequency and a lowered comet score. This bioassay confirms the urgency of integrating high-throughput screening in aquatic toxicity assessment at genetic levels, giving further evidence that in-vitro bioassays can be incorporated for use in short-term genotoxicity assays. The result suggests that the comet assay proved sensitive at detecting genotoxicity, supporting the integration of this into environmental monitoring frameworks targeted at AMD-contaminated sites.},

	abstract = {Bacterial communities colonized on submerged substrata are recognized as a key factor in the formation of complex biofouling phenomenon in the marine environment. Despite massive maritime activities and a large industrial sector in the nearshore of the Laccadive Sea, studies describing pioneer bacterial colonizers and community succession during the early-stage biofilm are scarce. We investigated the biofilm-forming bacterial community succession on three substrata viz. stainless steel, high-density polyethylene, and titanium over 15 days of immersion in the seawater intake area of a power plant, located in the southern coastal region of India. The bacterial community composition of biofilms and peripheral seawater were analyzed by Illumina MiSeq sequenced 16S rRNA gene amplicons. The obtained metataxonomic results indicated a profound influence of temporal succession over substrate type on the early-stage biofilm-forming microbiota. Bacterial communities showed vivid temporal dynamics that involved variations in abundant bacterial groups. The proportion of dominant phyla viz. Proteobacteria decreased over biofilm succession days, while Bacteroidetes increased, suggesting their role as initial and late colonizers, respectively. A rapid fluctuation in the proportion of two bacterial orders viz. Alteromonadales and Vibrionales were observed throughout the successional stages. LEfSe analysis identified specific bacterial groups at all stages of biofilm development, whereas no substrata type-specific groups were observed. Furthermore, the results of PCoA and UPGMA hierarchical clustering demonstrated that the biofilm-forming community varied considerably from the planktonic community. Phylum Proteobacteria preponderated the biofilm-forming community, while the Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria dominated the planktonic community. Overall, our results refute the common assumption that substrate material has a decisive impact on biofilm formation; rather, it portrayed that the temporal succession overshadowed the influence of the substrate material. Our findings provide a scientific understanding of the factors shaping initial biofilm development in the marine environment and will help in designing efficient site-specific anti-biofouling strategies.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we review the effects of large-scale neonicotinoid contaminations in the aquatic environment on non-target aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate species. These aquatic species are the fauna widely exposed to environmental changes and chemical accumulation in bodies of water. Neonicotinoids are insecticides that target the nicotinic type acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central nervous systems (CNS) and are considered selective neurotoxins for insects. However, studies on their physiologic impacts and interactions with non-target species are limited. In researches dedicated to exploring physiologic and toxic outcomes of neonicotinoids, studies relating to the effects on vertebrate species represent a minority case compared to invertebrate species. For aquatic species, the known effects of neonicotinoids are described in the level of organismal, behavioral, genetic and physiologic toxicities. Toxicological studies were reported based on the environment of bodies of water, temperature, salinity and several other factors. There exists a knowledge gap on the relationship between toxicity outcomes to regulatory risk valuation. It has been a general observation among studies that neonicotinoid insecticides demonstrate significant toxicity to an extensive variety of invertebrates. Comprehensive analysis of data points to a generalization that field-realistic and laboratory exposures could result in different or non-comparable results in some cases. Aquatic invertebrates perform important roles in balancing a healthy ecosystem, thus rapid screening strategies are necessary to verify physiologic and toxicological impacts. So far, much of the studies describing field tests on non-target species are inadequate and in many cases, obsolete. Considering the current literature, this review addresses important information gaps relating to the impacts of neonicotinoids on the environment and spring forward policies, avoiding adverse biological and ecological effects on a range of non-target aquatic species which might further impair the whole of the aquatic ecological web.},

	abstract = {The states of Michigan and Ohio issued shutdown orders in mid-March 2020 in an attempt to slow the spread of COVID-19, resulting in widespread disruption to economic and human activity. This study, which was commissioned by NASA headquarters, utilized satellite remote sensing data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite to investigate whether these changes in activity led to any short-term changes in water quality in the Great Lakes region by comparing 2020 data to a historic baseline. The water quality parameters examined included chlorophyll-a (CHL) and total suspended solids (TSS) concentrations, water clarity, and harmful algal bloom (HAB) extent. These parameters were investigated in two Great Lakes basins which experience significant anthropogenic pressure: the western basin of Lake Erie (WBLE) and Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron (SBLH). TSS concentrations in April 2020 were below the historic baseline in both basins, and largely remained low until September. SBLH also experienced elevated CHL concentrations in April which persisted through the summer. Additionally, the WBLE HAB extent was down in 2020 after an early end to the growing season. However, this investigation found that the COVID-19 shutdowns were likely not a direct driver of these short-term anomalies. Instead, recent trends in the indicators and co-occurring anomalies in hydrological and meteorological conditions (e.g., lake temperature, river discharge, and wind speed) appeared to be more responsible for the detected water quality changes. Future work will investigate whether the shutdowns have a long-term or delayed impact on Great Lakes water quality.},

	abstract = {Monitoring water quality is a critical aspect of environmental sustainability. Poor water quality has an impact not just on aquatic life but also on the ecosystem. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify peer-reviewed literature on the effectiveness of applying machine learning (ML) methodologies to estimate water quality parameters with satellite data. The data was gathered using the Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE citation databases. Related articles were extracted, selected, and evaluated using advanced keyword search and the PRISMA approach. The bibliographic information from publications written in journals during the previous two decades were collected. Publications that applied ML to water quality parameter retrieval with a focus on the application of satellite data were identified for further systematic review. A search query of 1796 papers identified 113 eligible studies. Popular ML models application were artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), regression, cubist, genetic programming (GP) and decision tree (DT). Common water quality parameters extracted were chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), temperature, salinity, colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), suspended solids and turbidity. According to the systematic analysis, ML can be successfully extended to water quality monitoring, allowing researchers to forecast and learn from natural processes in the environment, as well as assess human impacts on an ecosystem. These efforts will also help with restoration programs to ensure that environmental policy guidelines are followed.},

	abstract = {Ammonia is a pollutant frequently found in aquatic ecosystems. In fish, ammonia can cause physical damage, alter its behaviour, and even cause death. Exposure to ammonia also increases fish physiological stress, which can be measured through biomarkers. In this study, we analysed the effect of sublethal ammonia concentrations on the behaviour and the oxidative stress of Barbus meridionalis that had been pre-exposed to this compound in the wild. Wild-caught fish from a polluted site (pre-exposed fish) and from an unpolluted site (non-pre-exposed fish) were exposed, under experimental conditions, to total ammonia concentrations (TAN) of 0, 1, 5, and 8 mg/L. Swimming activity, feeding behaviour, and oxidative stress response based on biomarkers were analysed. Pre-exposed fish showed both an altered behaviour and an altered oxidative stress response in the control treatment (0 mg/L). Differences in swimming activity were also found as pre-exposed fish swam less. Lower feeding activity (voracity and satiety) and altered response to oxidative stress were also observed at ≥ 1 mg/L TAN. Biomarker results confirmed pre-exposed fish suffer from a reduction in their antioxidant defences and, hence, showed increased oxidative tissue damage. In summary, pre-exposed fish showed more sensitivity to ammonia exposure than fish from a pristine site.},

	abstract = {The immunotoxic effects of some anthropogenic pollutants on aquatic organisms are among the causes of concern over the presence of these pollutants in the marine environment. The immune system is part of an organism’s biological defense necessarily for homeostasis. Thus, the immunotoxicological impacts on aquatic organisms are important to understand the effects of pollutant chemicals in the aquatic ecosystem. When aquatic organisms are exposed to pollutant chemicals with immunotoxicity, it results in poor health. In addition, aquatic organisms are exposed to pathogenic bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Exposure to pollutant chemicals has reportedly caused aquatic organisms to show various immunotoxic symptoms such as histological changes of lymphoid tissue, changes of immune functionality and the distribution of immune cells, and changes in the resistance of organisms to infection by pathogens. Alterations of immune systems by contaminants can therefore lead to the deaths of individual organisms, increase the general risk of infections by pathogens, and probably decrease the populations of some species. This review introduced the immunotoxicological impact of pollutant chemicals in aquatic organisms, including invertebrates, fish, amphibians, and marine mammals; described typical biomarkers used in aquatic immunotoxicological studies; and then, discussed the current issues on ecological risk assessment and how to address ecological risk assessment through immunotoxicology. Moreover, the usefulness of the population growth rate to estimate the immunotoxicological impact of pollution chemicals was proposed.},

	abstract = {The round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), is a fish of Ponto-Caspian origin that has been invading the Baltic Sea since the 1990s. Currently, it is abundant and commercially important in some areas of the sea. This species was first reported in the eastern Gulf of Finland (GoF) in 2012. Its occurrence increased thereafter, however it has remained largely unstudied in this region. The aim of this study was to investigate the population characteristics of the round goby in the eastern GoF to better understand its expansion trend and whether it will become abundant enough to be exploited by the local fishery. Fish were caught using multi-mesh gillnets (12-60 mm mesh) and a beach seine (0.5-10 mm mesh). Occurrence, density, catch per unit effort, biomass per unit effort, relative number and biomass in catches, as well as age, size and sex ratio were studied. The species regularly occurred in samplings along the southern coastline of the GoF, as well as some central areas and along the northern coast. Within 2012-2019, its occurrence in catches increased, with the highest frequency in 2015-2019 in shallow waters ({\textless}1.5 m) of Koporye Bay (70\%) and in the deeper waters of Narva Bay (74\%). Similarly, the highest density in the shallow waters was also observed in Koporye Bay (10.0 ind. * 100 m-2), and offshore in Narva Bay. Relative abundance and biomass usually did not exceed 23\%, although it reached 93\% in Narva Bay. The oldest specimen was five years old. Young-of-the-year (YOY) juveniles predominated in the shallow waters (85\%), while three-year-olds prevailed in deeper waters (75\%). Among the fish older than two years, females were more predominant (mean ratio 3 to 1), and males were larger than females. Specimens in all life stages were found in the eastern GoF, and their abundance increased annually, suggesting that the round goby has successfully colonized this region of the Baltic Sea. However, compared to other areas of the Baltic Sea inhabited by longer-established populations, its population size is still relatively low.},

The stock density ranged from 0 to 124 ind. m−2, and biomass values varied from 0 to 300 g m−2. This results in a remarkable biomass of 201.2 (± 64.6) t and high abundance reaching 91.3 ± 32.9 million individuals, estimated an area of 4182 ha. The species distribution was also investigated, with the size ranging from 4.9 to 35.34 mm. The overall sex ratio (F:M) was 1.26:1, which significantly deviated different from parity (1:1). The main environmental factors were identified and several abiotic parameters were found to strongly affect the spread of the clam species.

One particular issue that warrants further characterization is the hazards associated with chemical additives within micro(nano)plastic as they are not chemically bound within the polymers and can be persistent and biologically active. Most plastics contain additives and are therefore potential vectors for the introduction of these chemicals into the environment as they leach from plastic, a process that can be accelerated through degradation and weathering processes. There are knowledge gaps on the ecotoxicological effects of plastic additives and how they are released from parent plastic materials as they progressively fragment from the meso to micro and nano scale. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of the ecotoxicity of plastic additives and identifies research needs to characterize the hazard they present to exposed biota. The potential ecological risk of chemical additives is of international concern so key differences in governance between the European Union and New Zealand to appropriately characterize their risk are highlighted.},

A decrease in the species richness and area of growth of macrophytes, a simplification of the structure of communities was noted. The renewal of plant communities in the places of their origin was recorded, primarily due to the species resistant to biogenic pollution. A decrease in the abundance of submerged species with wide leaves was revealed, which is an indicator of an increase in water turbidity. The species were found in the phyto- and zooplankton community, living in conditions of an increased content of nutrients and suspended matter. There was no significant decrease in the species diversity of summer plankton and benthos, and the quantitative indicators are comparable with the data before the work. A feature of the restoration of the zooplankton and benthic community was the appearance of brackish-water species in the river branches, which were not previously recorded there, incl. alien species of mollusks and polychaetes.},

Torchin Roles Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review \& editing Affiliation: Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Balboa, Ancon, Republic of Panama Introduction In symbiotic interactions [1], the identity of partner species can alter the costs and benefits for hosts and symbionts, leading to differences in the degree to which the interactions are beneficial, neutral, or antagonistic [2].

Symbiotic polyclads are potentially useful models for testing ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying host preference in marine symbionts, owing to their ability to utilize multiple host species and greater ease of manipulation under a laboratory setting [30, 32].

[...]we used a field experiment to assess whether flatworms variably influence the growth and survival of their preferred and less-preferred snail hosts.},

Given their worldwide dissemination and the scarcity of studies on marine fish, we evaluated the toxicity of an organic (oxybenzone) and an inorganic (titanium dioxide nanoparticles) UV filter, individually and in a binary mixture, in the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). Fish were intraperitoneally injected and a multi-level assessment was carried out 3 and 7 days later. Oxybenzone and titanium dioxide nanoparticles induced mild effects on turbot, both isolated and in mixture. Neither oxidative stress (intestine, liver and kidney) nor neurotoxicity (brain) was found. However, liver metabolic function was altered after 7 days, suggesting the impairment of the aerobic metabolism. An increased motility rate in oxybenzone treatment was the only behavioural alteration (day 7). The intestine and liver were preferentially targeted, while kidney and brain were unaffected. Both infra- and supra-additive interactions were perceived, with a toxicodynamic nature, resulting either in favourable or unfavourable toxicological outcomes, which were markedly dependent on the organ, parameter and post-injection time. The combined exposure to the UV filters did not show a consistent increment in toxicity in comparison with the isolated exposures, which is an ecologically relevant finding providing key information towards the formulation of environmentally safe sunscreen products.},

	abstract = {Background 
In recent years, there are growing concerns about pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) in natural ecosystems. These compounds have been found in natural waters and in fish tissues worldwide. Regarding their growing distribution and abundance, it is becoming clear that traditionally used risk assessment methodologies and ecotoxicological studies have limitations in several respects. In our study a new, combined approach of environmental impact assesment of PhACs has been used.
Methods
In this study, the constant watercourses of the suburban region of the Hungarian capital (Budapest) were sampled, and the body shape and scale shape of three fish species (roach Rutilus rutilus, chub Squalius cephalus, gibel carp Carassius gibelio) found in these waters were analyzed, based on landmark-based geometric morphometric methods. Possible connections were made between the differences in body shape and scale shape, and abiotic environmental variables (local- and landscape-scale) and measured PhACs.
Results
Significant connections were found between shape and PhACs concentrations in several cases. Despite the relatively large number of compounds (54) detected, citalopram, propranolol, codeine and trimetazidine significantly affected only fish body and scale shape, based on their concentrations. These four PhACs were shown to be high (citalopram), medium (propranolol and codeine), and low (trimetazidine) risk levels during the environmental risk assessment, which were based on Risk Quotient calculation. Furthermore, seven PhACs (diclofenac, Estrone (E1), tramadol, caffeine 17α-Ethinylestradiol (EE2), 17α-Estradiol (aE2), Estriol (E3)) were also categorized with a high risk level. However, our morphological studies indicated that only citalopram was found to affect fish phenotype amongst the PhACs posing high risk. Therefore, our results revealed that the output of (traditional) environmental/ecological risk assessment based on ecotoxicological data of different aquatic organisms not necessarily show consistency with a “real-life” situation; furthermore, the morphological investigations may also be a good sub-lethal endpoint in ecotoxicological assessments.},

A hydroponic experiment was performed to investigate the effects of D6 exposure (10–1000 mg L−1) on oxidative stress induction and gene expression changes in crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). The results showed that superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was enhanced by 20–32\% at low D6 exposure (10 mg L−1) in muscle but reduced in gill tissue at high D6 exposure (1000 mg L−1). High D6 (1000 mg L−1) also increased catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities in muscle tissue by 14–37\% and 14–45\%, respectively, and the same trend was observed in the carapace and gill tissue of crayfish. The Malondialdehyde (MDA), ascorbate (AsA), and glutathione (GSH) contents were increased by 16–31\%, 19–31\%, and 21–28\% in the muscle of crayfish under D6 exposure. Additionally, silicon (Si) content increased in three organs (gill, carapace, and muscle) of crayfish. Related genes involved in enzyme and nonenzyme activities were detected, and when crayfish was exposed to D6, genes such as Sod3, Cat3, Pod3, and Gsh3 were up-regulated, while Asa3 and Oxido3 were significantly down-regulated in the muscle. The research results help us to understand the toxicity of D6 in crayfish and provide a basis for further research on the mechanism of D6-induced stress in crayfish and other aquatic organisms.},

	abstract = {Ports are a good example of how coastal environments, gathering a set of diverse ecosystems, are subjected to pollution factors coming from human activities both on land and at sea. Among them, trace element as copper represents a major factor. Abundant in port ecosystem, copper is transported by runoff water and results from diverse port features (corrosion of structures, fuel, anti-fouling products, etc.). The variegated scallop Mimachlamys varia is common in the Atlantic port areas and is likely to be directly influenced by copper pollution, due to its sessile and filtering lifestyle. Thus, the aim of the present study is to investigate the disruption of the variegated scallop metabolism, under a short exposure (48 h) to a copper concentration frequently encountered in the waters of the largest marina in Europe (82 μg/L). For this, we chose a non-targeted metabolomic approach using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS), offering a high level of sensitivity and allowing the study without a priori of the entire metabolome. We described 28 metabolites clearly modulated by copper. They reflected the action of copper on several biological functions such as osmoregulation, oxidative stress, reproduction and energy metabolism.},

We compared the quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) and the isotope-mixing model IsoError, based on the compound-specific isotope analysis of fatty acids (CSIA-FA), which are potentially effective models for quantitative diet estimations. In a 21-day experiment, Daphnia was fed a mixture of two food items, Chlorella and Cryptomonas, which were supplied in nearly equal proportions. The percentages and isotope values of the FAs of the algal species and Daphnia were measured. The IsoError based on CSIA-FA gave an estimation of algae consumption using only one FA, 18:3n-3. According to this model, the proportion of consumption of Chlorella decreased while the proportion of consumption of Cryptomonas increased during the experiment. The QFASA model was used for two FA subsets—the extended-dietary subset, which included sixteen FAs, and the dietary one, which included nine FAs. According to both subsets, the portion of consumed Chlorella decreased from Day 5 to 10 and then increased at Day 21. The comparison of the two model approaches showed that the QFASA model is a more reliable method to determine the contribution of different food sources to the diet of zooplankton than the CSIA-based mixing model.},

During the last few decades there have been noteworthy advances in technologies for the automated sensing of physicochemical parameters of water. These do not translate well into online monitoring of chemical pollutants since most of them are either incapable of real-time detection or unable to detect impacts on biological organisms. As a result, biological early warning systems have been proposed to supplement conventional water quality test strategies. Such systems can continuously evaluate physiological parameters of suitable aquatic species and alert the user to the presence of toxicants. In this regard, single cellular organisms, such as bacteria, cyanobacteria, micro-algae and vertebrate cell lines, offer promising avenues for development of water biosensors. Historically, only a handful of systems utilising single-cell organisms have been deployed as established online water biomonitoring tools. Recent advances in recombinant microorganisms, cell immobilisation techniques, live-cell microarrays and microfluidic Lab-on-a-Chip technologies open new avenues to develop miniaturised systems capable of detecting a broad range of water contaminants. In experimental settings, they have been shown as sensitive and rapid biosensors with capabilities to detect traces of contaminants. In this work, we critically review the recent advances and practical prospects of biological early warning systems based on live-cell biosensors. We demonstrate historical deployment successes, technological innovations, as well as current challenges for the broader deployment of live-cell biosensors in the monitoring of water quality.},

	abstract = {The heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) experiment developed by Bodenhausen and Ruben (1980) in the early days of modern nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is without a doubt one of the most widely used experiments, with applications in almost every aspect of NMR including metabolomics. Acquiring this experiment, however, always implies a trade-off: simplification versus resolution. Here, we present a method that artificially lifts this barrier and demonstrate its application towards metabolite identification in a complex mixture. Based on the measurement of clean in-phase and clean anti-phase (CLIP/CLAP) HSQC spectra (Enthart et al., 2008), we construct a virtually decoupled HSQC (vd-HSQC) spectrum that maintains the highest possible resolution in the proton dimension. Combining this vd-HSQC spectrum with a J-resolved spectrum (Pell and Keeler, 2007) provides useful information for the one-dimensional proton spectrum assignment and for the identification of metabolites in Dreissena polymorpha (Prud'homme et al., 2020).},

	abstract = {On the Keweenaw Peninsula of Lake Superior, two stamp mills (Mohawk and Wolverine) discharged 22.7 million metric tonnes (MMT) of tailings (1901–1932) into the coastal zone off the town of Gay. Migrating along the shoreline, ca. 10 MMT of the tailings dammed stream and river outlets, encroached upon wetlands, and contaminated recreational beaches. A nearly equal amount of tailings moved across bay benthic environments into critical commercial fish spawning and rearing grounds. In the middle of the bay, Buffalo Reef is important for commercial and recreational lake trout and lake whitefish production (ca. 32\% of the commercial catch in Keweenaw Bay, 22\% along southern Lake Superior). Aerial photographs (1938–2016) and five LiDAR and multispectral over-flights (2008–2016) emphasize: (1) the enormous amounts of tailings moving along the beach; and (2) the bathymetric complexities of an equal amount migrating underwater across the shelf. However, remote sensing studies encounter numerous specific challenges in coastal environments. Here, we utilize a combination of elevation data (LiDAR digital elevation/bathymetry models) and in situ studies to generate a series of physical, chemical, and biological geospatial maps. The maps are designed to help assess the impacts of historical mining on Buffalo Reef. Underwater, sand mixtures have complicated multispectral bottom reflectance substrate classifications. An alternative approach, in situ simple particle classification, keying off distinct sand end members: (1) allows calculation of tailings (stamp sand) percentages; (2) aids indirect and direct assays of copper concentrations; and (3) permits determinations of density effects on benthic macro-invertebrates. The geospatial mapping shows how tailings are moving onto Buffalo Reef, the copper concentrations associated with the tailings, and how both strongly influence the density of benthic communities, providing an excellent example for the International Maritime Organization on how mining may influence coastal reefs. We demonstrate that when large amounts of mine tailings are discharged into coastal environments, temporal and spatial impacts are progressive, and strongly influence resident organisms. Next steps are to utilize a combination of hi-resolution LiDAR and sonar surveys, a fish-monitoring array, and neural network analysis to characterize the geometry of cobble fields where fish are successful or unsuccessful at producing young.},

	abstract = {Background
Heterobranchia is a diverse clade of marine, freshwater, and terrestrial gastropod molluscs. It includes such disparate taxa as nudibranchs, sea hares, bubble snails, pulmonate land snails and slugs, and a number of (mostly small-bodied) poorly known snails and slugs collectively referred to as the “lower heterobranchs”. Evolutionary relationships within Heterobranchia have been challenging to resolve and the group has been subject to frequent and significant taxonomic revision. Mitochondrial (mt) genomes can be a useful molecular marker for phylogenetics but, to date, sequences have been available for only a relatively small subset of Heterobranchia.
Results
To assess the utility of mitochondrial genomes for resolving evolutionary relationships within this clade, eleven new mt genomes were sequenced including representatives of several groups of “lower heterobranchs”. Maximum likelihood analyses of concatenated matrices of the thirteen protein coding genes found weak support for most higher-level relationships even after several taxa with extremely high rates of evolution were excluded. Bayesian inference with the CAT + GTR model resulted in a reconstruction that is much more consistent with the current understanding of heterobranch phylogeny. Notably, this analysis recovered Valvatoidea and Orbitestelloidea in a polytomy with a clade including all other heterobranchs, highlighting these taxa as important to understanding early heterobranch evolution. Also, dramatic gene rearrangements were detected within and between multiple clades. However, a single gene order is conserved across the majority of heterobranch clades.
Conclusions
Analysis of mitochondrial genomes in a Bayesian framework with the site heterogeneous CAT + GTR model resulted in a topology largely consistent with the current understanding of heterobranch phylogeny. However, mitochondrial genomes appear to be too variable to serve as good phylogenetic markers for robustly resolving a number of deeper splits within this clade.},

Results highlighted the minimal number and small space devoted to wildlife news items in Iranian newspapers.AbstractHuman response to wildlife management is widespread, encompassing both human–wildlife conflicts and wildlife conservation, in different places and at different times. As people become increasingly aware of the importance of wildlife to biological and environmental sustainability, newspapers can be important sources of information, especially in developing countries, such as Iran. Three major Iranian daily newspapers were analysed for news items related to wildlife. Over the 7-year study period, 434 articles presented environmental news, of which 61 items referred to wildlife. Each wildlife item was recorded in terms of message, contributor, spatiality, and allocated space. Structure query language (SQL) was used to analyse relationships between the 915 fields/entries. Wildlife items were characterised by public awareness (51\%), columnist contributions (46\%), and local spatiality (43\%). Most items (82\%) were allocated space of less than half a page. Of the categorised topics, those of combined endangered land (30\%) and marine (5\%) species exceeded items on global conservation (24\%). Results highlighted the minimal number and small space devoted to wildlife news items and their concentrations (67\%) in one of the three sampled newspapers. Although nature has historically been important in Iranian culture, current attitudes to wildlife, as reflected in newspaper coverage, do not seem to mirror these traditional perspectives. Given the widespread distribution of newspapers and their roles (i.e., as sources of information and opinion influencers), global wildlife conservation issues would benefit from much greater coverage in the daily press.},

The SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was implemented in the basin to work towards the goal of simulating nutrient loading. A key conclusion of this review study is for the local population to have advocacy for the “zero wastewater discharge to Lake Atitlan” initiative to bring long-term benefits to lake water quality. One of the recommended policy decisions is to seek external financing from international agencies like the World Bank at low-cost interest (IDA Loans) to implement waste management systems and pay this external debt by putting a small but affordable tax on tourists visiting the lake. Once a culture of zero municipal effluent discharge to Lake Atitlan is adopted by the local population, the livelihood of residents will become sustainable and the standard of living will increase because of improved water and air quality, making Lake Atitlan a haven of tourism for Guatemala and lifting its economy.},

	abstract = {Animal behaviour is becoming increasingly popular as an endpoint in ecotoxicology due to its increased sensitivity and speed compared to traditional endpoints. However, the widespread use of animal behaviours in environmental risk assessment is currently hindered by a lack of optimisation and standardisation of behavioural assays for model species. In this study, assays to assess swimming speed were developed for a model crustacean species, the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana. Preliminary works were performed to determine optimal arena size for this species, and weather lux used in the experiments had an impact on the animals phototactic response. Swimming speed was significantly lower in the smallest arena, whilst no difference was observed between the two larger arenas, suggesting that the small arena was limiting swimming ability. No significant difference was observed in attraction to light between high and low light intensities. Arena size had a significant impact on phototaxis behaviours. Large arenas resulted in animals spending more time in the light side of the arena compared to medium and small, irrespective of light intensity. The swimming speed assay was then used to expose specimens to a range of psychotropic compounds with varying modes of action. Results indicate that swimming speed provides a valid measure of the impacts of behaviour modulating compounds on A. franciscana. The psychotropic compounds tested varied in their impacts on animal behaviour. Fluoxetine resulted in increased swimming speed as has been found in other crustacean species, whilst oxazepam, venlafaxine and amitriptyline had no significant impacts on the behaviours measured. The results from this study suggest a simple, fast, high throughput assay for A. franciscana and gains insight on the impacts of a range of psychotropic compounds on the swimming behaviours of a model crustacean species used in ecotoxicology studies.},

Due to their large surface area and high reactivity, ENMs offer the potential for the efficient removal of pollutants from environmental matrices with better performances compared to conventional techniques. However, their fate and safety upon environmental application, which can be associated with their release into the environment, are largely unknown. It is essential to develop systems that can predict ENM interactions with biological systems, their overall environmental and human health impact. Until now, Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools have been employed to investigate ENMs potential environmental impact, from raw material production, design and to their final disposal. However, LCA studies focused on the environmental impact of the production phase lacking information on their environmental impact deriving from in situ employment. A recently developed eco-design framework aimed to fill this knowledge gap by using ecotoxicological tools that allow the assessment of potential hazards posed by ENMs to natural ecosystems and wildlife. In the present review, we illustrate the development of the eco-design framework and review the application of ecotoxicology as a valuable strategy to develop ecosafe ENMs for environmental remediation. Furthermore, we critically describe the currently available ENMs for marine environment remediation and discuss their pros and cons in safe environmental applications together with the need to balance benefits and risks promoting an environmentally safe nanoremediation (ecosafe) for the future.},

This study addresses the biochemical responses to sublethal concentrations of A. armata exudate on the marine snail Gibbula umbilicalis whole body and the shrimp Palaemon elegans eyes and hepatopancreas. Antioxidant defenses superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), oxidative damage endpoints lipid peroxidation (LPO) and DNA damage, the neuronal parameter acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and the fatty acid profile were evaluated. Results revealed different metabolic responses in both species. Despite previous studies indicating that the exudate affected G. umbilicalis’ survival and behavior, this does not seem to result from oxidative stress or neurotoxicity. For P. elegans, the inhibition of AChE and the decrease of antioxidant capacity is concomitant with the increase of LPO, suggesting neurotoxicity and oxidative stress as contributor mechanisms of toxicity for this species. Fatty acid profile changes were more pronounced for P. elegans with a general increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with the exudate exposure, which commonly means a defense mechanism protecting from membrane disruption. Nonetheless, the omega-3 PUFAs arachidonic acid (ARA) and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) increased in both invertebrates, indicating a common regulation mechanism of inflammation and immunity responses.},

Patella caerulea microbiome variations were explained in the broad marine metacommunity context, assessing the water and sediment microbiome composition at both sites, and characterizing the microbiome associated with the farmed sea bream. The P. caerulea digestive gland microbiome at the aquaculture site was characterized by a lower diversity, the loss of microorganisms sensitive to heavy metal contamination, and by the acquisition of fish pathogens and parasites. However, we also observed possible adaptive responses of the P. caerulea digestive gland microbiome at the aquaculture site, including the acquisition of putative bacteria able to deal with metal and sulfide accumulation, highlighting the inherent microbiome potential to drive the host acclimation to stressful conditions.},

	abstract = {The current research investigated the potential environmental risk of the polycyclic musk compounds, Galaxolide® (HHCB) and Tonalide® (AHTN), in the marine environments. These substances are lipophilic, bioaccumulated, and potentially biomagnified in aquatic organisms. To understand the toxicity of HHCB and AHTN, acute toxicity tests were performed by exposing marine microalgae (Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Tretraselmis chuii, and Isochrysis galbana), crustaceans (Artemia franciscana), echinoderms (Paracentrotus lividus), bivalves (Mytilus galloprovincialis), fish (Sparus aurata), and a candidate freshwater microalga (Raphidocelis subcapitata) to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.005–5 µg/L) following standardized protocols (US EPA, Environment Canada and OECD). P. tricornutum and I. galbana were sensitive to both substances and for P. tricornutum exposed to HHCB and AHTN, the IC10 values (the inhibition concentration at which 10\% microalgae growth inhibition was observed) were 0.127 and 0.002 µg/L, respectively, while IC10 values calculated for I. galbana were 5.22 µg/L (a little higher than the highest concentration) and 0.328 µg/L, for HHCB and AHTN, respectively. Significant (p {\textless} 0.01) concentration dependent responses were measured in P. lividus and M. galloprovincialis larvae developments, as well as S. aurata mortality tested with HHCB. The effect of HHCB on P. lividus larvae development was the most sensitive endpoint recorded, producing an EC50 value (the effect concentration at which 50\% effect was observed) of 4.063 µg/L. Considering the risk quotients both substances seem to represent high environmental risk to P. tricornutum and M. galloprovincialis in marine environments.},

The SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) was implemented in the basin to work towards the goal of simulating nutrient loading. A key conclusion of this review study is for the local population to have advocacy for the “zero wastewater discharge to Lake Atitlan” initiative to bring long-term benefits to lake water quality. One of the recommended policy decisions is to seek external financing from international agencies like the World Bank at low-cost interest (IDA Loans) to implement waste management systems and pay this external debt by putting a small but affordable tax on tourists visiting the lake. Once a culture of zero municipal effluent discharge to Lake Atitlan is adopted by the local population, the livelihood of residents will become sustainable and the standard of living will increase because of improved water and air quality, making Lake Atitlan a haven of tourism for Guatemala and lifting its economy.},

Instead, of the many trials to develop marine invertebrate cell cultures, only a few have obtained them and only from few tissues. Since in vitro cell culture of invertebrates could be very useful for many aspects of basic and applied science, in this work we investigate and describe the development of a technique for the establishment of cell cultures from gill, mantle and gonadic tissue of the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum). We maintained viable cultures for up to 25 days. Culture viability and proliferation were tested with 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) and with trypan blue, while an antibody against the ATP-dependent RNA helicase VASA, a protein expressed in the germline, and in multipotent stem cells of some animals, was used to verify the presence of these cell types. Following the described protocol: 1) explant resulted the better source to obtain cell cultures, when compared to enzymatic dissociation; 2) cultures of suspended cells were viable for longer period than adherent cells; 3) cell cultures obtained from tissues sampled in September-October performed better compared to other periods of the year, regarding maintenance and growth; 4) the tissue from which we obtained longer-lived cell cultures was gonadic tissue, especially form samples that show more undifferentiated germ cells and more VASA-stained cells. This study describes the challenges concerning the development of in vitro culture techniques for aquatic invertebrates.},

These species were selected based on their ecological and biological differences and were assessed in relation to their ecological and biological characteristics. The following parameters of oxidative stress were determined: the levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and reduced glutathione; the activity of the antioxidant enzyme catalase (CAT); the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), a product of lipid peroxidation; and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity. Results demonstrated significant differences among taxa in the specific activity of most investigated parameters. Prodiamesa olivacea showed the greatest antioxidant protection (activity of CAT, level of reduced glutathione (GSH)) and the highest detoxification activities (activity of GST and level of GSH). Predatory C. melanops was shown to be the most promiscuous biomarker for assessing the total antioxidant activity. We demonstrate that the four chironomid taxa, occupying the same ecosystem, share an important antioxidant enzymatic and non-enzymatic pool, but with oxidative stress parameters differing among the four species.},

Such an approach is currently underway in the Western Lake Erie Basin, where the province of Ontario and the state of Ohio have embarked on a 40\% phosphorus run-off reduction target to address eutrophication problems in the lake. In this study, we adopt the concept of discourse to inform our understanding of the collaborative process undertaken to develop domestic action plans (DAPs) to guide efforts by various stakeholders. We find that in both cases there were distinct groups of actors who shared and promoted a particular narrative or storyline. These storylines provided varying accounts of the science and policy aspects of the eutrophication problem in Lake Erie, and there was variation as well in the specific actors to whom they attributed responsibility. We illustrate how the storylines shaped the nature and form of the action plans. We provide a discussion of the policy implications of unequal capacities among different actor coalitions to influence trajectories and outcomes in the context of governance for water quality. It is shown that the potential of discourse coalitions to influence policy raises important questions as to whose voice is considered legitimate enough to be included in the policy process.},

	abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) can readily be ingested by marine organisms. Direct ingestion and trophic transfer are likely to be the main pathway for microplastics to bioaccumulate in upper trophic level organisms. Bioaccumulation potential of MPs in marine mammalian foodwebs is scarcely known. To understand whether microplastics bioaccumulate in marine mammals, a bioaccumulation model for MPs was developed for the filter-feeding humpback whale and fish-eating resident killer whale foodwebs of the Northeastern Pacific. Applying three concentration scenarios for MPs by entering observed water and sediment concentrations as input data (low, high and moderate scenarios), and tested under two different elimination rates (kE) for zooplankton, the model predicted species-specific and foodweb-specific bioaccumulation potential. The predator-prey biomagnification factor (BMFTL, used to assess the ratio of the MP concentration in predator to that in prey adjusted to the difference of trophic levels), involving cetaceans, appeared to be not only lower than one or equal to one (BMFTL ≤ 1 as in resident killer whale/Chinook salmon), but also BMFTL {\textgreater} 1 in some predator-prey relationships (humpback whale/zooplankton). Depending on the magnitude of abiotic concentrations used in the modelling, the trophic magnification factor (TMF) regression analyses over time showed lack of evidence for trophic magnification as the magnification was independent of the trophic level, indicating no changes (TMF = 1; p{\textgreater}0.05), and trophic dilution (TMF{\textless}1; p{\textless}0.05) due to the decrease in MP concentrations as the trophic level increased. Projected biomagnification in simplified foodwebs revealed no significant increase in concentrations as the trophic level increased (TMF=1; p{\textgreater}0.05), following 100-365 days. Compared to the high biomagnification behaviour of persistent organic pollutants in marine foodwebs, scarce biomagnification capacity of microplastic was predicted in the cetacean foodwebs. Notwithstanding, the moderate to high microplastic bioaccumulation predicted in some lower trophic level marine organisms highlights the health risks of toxic exposure to marine fauna and coastal communities relying strongly on seafood. This modelling work provides a tool to assess the bioaccumulation potential and impact of microplastics in the marine environment to support risk assessment and inform plastic waste management.},

	abstract = {Piscine novirhabdovirus = Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV) first appeared in the Laurentian Great Lakes with large outbreaks from 2005 to 2006, as a new and novel RNA rhabdovirus subgenogroup (IVb) that killed {\textgreater}30 fish species. Interlude periods punctuated smaller more localized outbreaks in 2007, 2010, and 2017, although some fishes tested positive in the intervals. There have not been reports of outbreaks or positives from 2018, 2019, or 2020. Here, we employ a combined population genetics and phylogenetic approach to evaluate spatial and temporal evolutionary trajectory on its G‐gene sequence variation, in comparison with whole‐genome sequences (11,083 bp) from a subset of 44 individual isolates (including 40 newly sequenced ones). Our results show that IVb (N = 184 individual fish isolates) diversified into 36 G‐gene haplotypes from 2003 to 2017, stemming from two originals (“a” and “b”). G‐gene haplotypes “a” and “b” differed by just one synonymous single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) substitution, remained the most abundant until 2011, then disappeared. Group “a” descendants (14 haplotypes) remained most prevalent in the Upper and Central Great Lakes, with eight (51\%) having nonsynonymous substitutions. Group “b” descendants primarily have occurred in the Lower Great Lakes, including 22 haplotypes, of which 15 (68\%) contained nonsynonymous changes. Evolutionary patterns of the whole‐genome sequences (which had 34 haplotypes among 44 isolates) appear congruent with those from the G‐gene. Virus populations significantly diverged among the Upper, Central, and Lower Great Lakes, diversifying over time. Spatial divergence was apparent in the overall patterns of nucleotide substitutions, while amino acid changes increased temporally. VHSV‐IVb thus significantly differentiated across its less than two decades in the Great Lakes, accompanied by declining outbreaks and virulence. Continuing diversification likely allowed the virus to persist at low levels in resident fish populations, and may facilitate its potential for further and future spread to new habitats and nonacclimated hosts.},

	abstract = {There is an extensive literature establishing, validating, and quantifying a wide range of responses of fishes to fasting. Our study complements this work by comparing fed and unfed treatments of hatchery-raised Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus)—an imperiled fish that is endemic to the San Francisco Estuary and its tributaries in California, USA—across a diverse suite of endpoints over a two-month time series. The experiment was conducted at 15.9°C, and individuals were sampled at 12 time points as starvation became increasingly severe. We found that hepatosomatic index and condition factor were relatively sensitive to starvation, becoming significantly depressed at Day 4 and 7, respectively. Histological analysis of liver showed elevated cytoplasmic inclusion bodies at Day 7, followed by increased glycogen depletion, single cell necrosis, and hydropic vacuolar degeneration at Day 14, 21, and 28, respectively. Of four antioxidants measured, glutathione decreased at Day 4, superoxide dismutase increased at Day 14, catalase increased at Day 56, and glutathione peroxidase was not affected by starvation. The net result was a {\textasciitilde}2-fold increase in lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) in fasted fish that was highly inconsistent through time. RNA to DNA ratio and triglycerides in muscle were relatively insensitive to starvation, only consistently decreasing with fasting after mortality began increasing in the ‘No Feeding’ treatment, at Day 21. Together, these results suggest that Delta Smelt mobilize hepatic energy stores far more rapidly than lipids in muscle when subjected to fasting, leading to rapid atrophy of liver and the development of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies—possibly autophagosomes—in hepatocytes.},

	abstract = {Ionic liquids (ILs) are solvents with salt structures. Typically, they contain organic cations (ammonium, imidazolium, pyridinium, piperidinium or pyrrolidinium), and halogen, fluorinated or organic anions. While ILs are considered to be environmentally-friendly compounds, only a few reasons support this claim. This is because of high thermal stability, and negligible pressure at room temperature which makes them non-volatile, therefore preventing the release of ILs into the atmosphere. The expansion of the range of applications of ILs in many chemical industry fields has led to a growing threat of contamination of the aquatic and terrestrial environments by these compounds. As the possibility of the release of ILs into the environment s grow systematically, there is an increasing and urgent obligation to determine their toxic and antimicrobial influence on the environment. Many bioassays were carried out to evaluate the (eco)toxicity and biodegradability of ILs. Most of them have questioned their “green” features as ILs turned out to be toxic towards organisms from varied trophic levels. Therefore, there is a need for a new biodegradable, less toxic “greener” ILs. This review presents the potential risks to the environment linked to the application of ILs. These are the following: cytotoxicity evaluated by the use of human cells, toxicity manifesting in aqueous and terrestrial environments. The studies proving the relation between structures versus toxicity for ILs with special emphasis on directions suitable for designing safer ILs synthesized from renewable sources are also presented. The representants of a new generation of easily biodegradable ILs derivatives of amino acids, sugars, choline, and bicyclic monoterpene moiety are collected. Some benefits of using ILs in medicine, agriculture, and the bio-processing industry are also presented.},

Eight (8) heavy metals (Mn, Cu, Pb, Fe, Zn, Cd, Cr and Ni) were assessed between January and June 2018 in 3 stations, using atomic absorption spectrometer, and compared with Nigerian drinking water standards. Some of the heavy metals evaluated exceeded standards and warranted health risk assessment. Health risk assessment for all the stations indicated that there is no particularly dangerous single heavy metal, but their cumulative effect, indicated by the hazard index (HI). HI for all the stations highly exceeded threshold value (1). This calls for concern for both adults and children exposed to the water through ingestion. The heavy metal contamination observed was geogenic, exacerbated by anthropogenic activities.},

Copper water quality criteria in marine waters is often determined with bivalve embryo-larval toxicity tests which measure survival and normal development as endpoints. Gene expression data is increasingly incorporated into such assays as a complementary and sensitive marker of contaminant exposure or toxicity. Here we measured the impacts of copper on Mytilus californianus larval transcriptional profiles, and identified sensitive biomarkers of copper exposure. Key functional categories that were identified among these genes include biomineralization/shell formation, metal binding, and development. Finally, we compared the transcriptional response of larvae to that of adult gill tissue, and show in both datasets that patterns of declining transcript expression occur at lower copper concentrations than those required to induce increases in transcript expression, suggesting that down-regulated genes serve as the most sensitive marker of copper exposure.},

	abstract = {No effective method has yet been developed to prevent the threat posed by the emerging disease—cercarial dermatitis (swimmer’s itch), caused by infective cercariae of bird schistosomes (Digenea: Schistosomatidae). In our previous studies, the New Zealand mud snail—Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1853; Gastropoda, Tateidae)—was used as a barrier between the miracidia of Trichobilharzia regenti and the target snails Radix balthica. Since the presence of non-indigenous snails reduced the parasite prevalence under laboratory conditions, we posed three new research questions: (1) Do bird schistosomes show totally perfect efficacy for chemotactic swimming behavior? (2) Do the larvae respond to substances emitted by incompatible snail species? (3) Do the excretory-secretory products of incompatible snail species interfere with the search for a compatible snail host? The experiments were carried out in choice-chambers for the miracidia of T. regenti and T. szidati. The arms of the chambers, depending on the variant, were filled with water conditioned by P. antipodarum, water conditioned by lymnaeid hosts, and dechlorinated tap water. Miracidia of both bird schistosome species chose more frequently the water conditioned by snails—including the water conditioned by the incompatible lymnaeid host and the alien species, P. antipodarum. However, species-specific differences were noticed in the behavior of miracidia. T. regenti remained more often inside the base arm rather than in the arm filled with water conditioned by P. antipodarum or the control arm. T. szidati, however, usually left the base arm and moved to the arm filled with water conditioned by P. antipodarum. In conclusion, the non-host snail excretory-secretory products may interfere with the snail host-finding behavior of bird schistosome miracidia and therefore they may reduce the risk of swimmer’s itch.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.9377},
	abstract = {Background 
Predicting the effects of climate warming on the dynamics of ecological systems requires understanding how temperature influences birth rates, death rates and the strength of species interactions. The temperature dependance of these processes—which are the underlying mechanisms of ecological dynamics—is often thought to be exponential or unimodal, generally supported by short-term experiments. However, ecological dynamics unfold over many generations. Our goal was to empirically document shifts in predator–prey cycles over the full range of temperatures that can possibly support a predator–prey system and then to uncover the effect of temperature on the underlying mechanisms driving those changes.
Methods
We measured the population dynamics of the Didinium-Paramecium predator–prey system across a wide range of temperatures to reveal systematic changes in the dynamics of the system. We then used ordinary differential equation fitting to estimate parameters of a model describing the dynamics, and used these estimates to assess the long-term temperature dependance of all the underlying mechanisms.
Results
We found that predator–prey cycles shrank in state space from colder to hotter temperatures and that both cycle period and amplitude varied with temperature. Model parameters showed mostly unimodal responses to temperature, with one parameter (predator mortality) increasing monotonically with temperature and one parameter (predator conversion efficiency) invariant with temperature. Our results indicate that temperature can have profound, systematic effects on ecological dynamics, and these can arise through diverse and simultaneous changes in multiple underlying mechanisms. Predicting the effects of temperature on ecological dynamics may require additional investigation into how the underlying drivers of population dynamics respond to temperature beyond a short-term, acute response.},

	abstract = {Radioisotopes have been used in earth and environmental sciences for over 150 years and provide unique tools to study environmental processes in great detail from a cellular level through to an oceanic basin scale. These nuclear techniques have been employed to understand coastal and marine ecosystems via laboratory and field studies to understand how aquatic organisms respond to environmental stressors including temperature, pH, nutrients, metals, organic anthropogenic compounds and biological toxins. Global marine issues, such as ocean warming, deoxygenation, plastic pollution, ocean acidification, increased duration and intensity of toxic harmful algal blooms (HABs), and coastal contamination are all impacting marine environments, thereby imposing various environmental and economic risks. Being able to reliably assess the health of coastal and marine ecosystems, and how they may respond to future disturbances, can provide vital information for society in the sustainable management of their marine environments. This paper summarises the historical use of radiotracers in these systems, describes how existing techniques of radioecological tracing can be developed for specific current environmental issues and provides information on emerging issues that would benefit from current and new radiotracer methods. Current challenges with using radioecological tracers and opportunities are highlighted as well as opportunities to maximise the uptake of these methods to greatly increase the ability of environmental managers to conduct evidence-based management of coastal and marine ecosystems.},

Improvements to methods of repeatable isolation, culture, and characterisation of oyster cells and tissues are required to help address these issues. In the current study, systematic improvements have been developed to facilitate the culture of primary cells from adult Pacific oyster tissues and identify novel cell morphologies that have not been reported previously. Cultures analysed by light microscopy, qPCR, and live cell imaging demonstrated maintenance of live, metabolically active Pacific oyster cells for several weeks post-explant. Interestingly, whole hearts dissected from adult oysters were found to continue contracting rhythmically up to 8 weeks after being transferred to a tissue culture system. Mantle tissue explants were also actively moving in the culture system. These improvements in primary cell culture of bivalves may be beneficial for research in ecotoxicology, virology, immunology, and genetic resistance to disease.},

	abstract = {Die praktische Umsetzung der Europäischen Wasserrahmenrichtlinie zeigt, dass ein großer Teil der Gewässer in Deutschland den guten ökologischen Zustand" der WRR derzeit nicht erreicht. Die Analyse der vielfältigen Belastungen der Fließgewässer legt nahe, sich zukünftig auf Maßnahmen zu konzentrieren, die eine hydromorphologische Verbesserung der Gewässer zum Ziel haben. Dadurch sollen verbesserte Lebensbedingungen für Organismen herbeigeführt werden, um letztlich eine gute" Bewertung zu erreichen. In den letzten Jahren wurde bereits mit der Konzeption und Umsetzung solcher Maßnahmen begonnen. Auch viele aktuell erarbeitete Bewirtschaftungspläne sind von Maßnahmen zur Verbesserung der Gewässerstruktur und Durchgängigkeit geprägt - in vielen Fällen ist jedoch unsicher, ob die Renaturierungsmaßnahmen tatsächlich zu einer ökologischen Verbesserung führen werden. Vor diesem Hintergrund hat dieser Band zum Ziel, Konzeption, Durchführung und Effizienz aktuell in Deutschland durchgeführter und geplanter Renaturierungen vorzustellen. Anhand von Projekten zu verschiedenen Gewässertypen, Nutzungsformen und Landschaftsräumen (Mittelgebirgsbäche und -flüsse, Tieflandflüsse, Bundeswasserstraßen, Gewässer in der Stadt und in einem Biosphären-Reservat) entsteht ein Überblick über verschiedenste Planungsobjekte und Maßnahmenkonzepte. Auch die Methodik der Erfolgskontrollen und deren Ergebnisse die Wirkung auf unterschiedliche Organismengruppen des Gewässers und der Aue wird dargestellt. Im zweiten Teil wird die Frage erörtert, wie sich Renaturierungsmaßnahmen großräumig konzipieren und priorisieren lassen. Die Autoren stellen Konzeptionen für größere Gebiete (z.B. Bundesländer und das Gebiet der ganzen Bundesrepublik Deutschland) vor. Ferner wird die Frage, welche Randbedingungen den Erfolg von Renaturierungen beeinflussen, diskutiert. Abschließend folgen eine kritische Würdigung verschiedener Renaturierungsmaßnahmen und ihrer räumlichen Konfigurationen sowie Empfehlungen für zukünftige Renaturierungsmaßnahmen. Der Band richtet sich an mit der Umsetzung der Richtlinie befasste Anwender in der Wasserwirtschaft, die interessierte Öffentlichkeit und die Institute der angewandten Forschung, Naturschützer und Planer. Rezension Gewässertypisierung und Formulierung von Leitbildern ihre Ausrichtung erhielt. Einen vorläufigen Abschluss erfuhr die Entwicklung durch die Vorgaben der EU-Wasserrahmenrichtlinie von 2000. Eine Bilanz nach 10 Jahren WRR zieht der vorliegende Sammelband mit 24 Einzelbeiträgen. Der erste Block umfasst Fallstudien zur Erfolgskontrolle von Gewässern in Nordrhein-Westfalen und Hessen. Die Auswahl reicht von einzelnen Bächen in der Fläche und im urbanen Bereich bis zum Umbau des Emscher-Systems, dem größten Renaturierungsprojekt in Europa. In Berlin wurde die Panke betrachtet, deren Zustand schon vor 110 Jahren Gegenstand einer großangelegten amtlichen Untersuchung war (was nicht erwähnt wurde). Ein zweiter Block behandelt unterschiedliche Konzepte von Verbesserungsmaßnahmen an Wasserstraßen. Schließlich erweitert eine Übersicht über Planungen zur Verbesserung des ökologischen Zustands von Fließgewässern in Schleswig-Holstein, Thüringen und Berlin den geographischen Rahmen. Hier vermisst man Beiträge aus Süddeutschland (Rheinland-Pfalz, Baden- Württemberg, Bayern). Der Schlussbeitrag diskutiert zusammenfassend Fragen der Erfolgskontrolle: "Um Renaturierungen in Zukunft zu optimieren, müssen Erfahrungen dokumentiert, gesammelt und ausgewertet werden". Genau hierzu ist der neue Band von "Limnologie aktuell" ein erster Schritt. Wer Renaturierungen plant oder den ökologischen Erfolg solcher Maßnahmen prüft, wird in den einzelnen Beiträgen viel Material finden, dazu unterschiedliche Ansätze, Konzepte, Folgerungen und Meinungen. Sie zeigen, die Antworten der Natur auf Irritationen sind vielfältig und nur bedingt vorhersagbar; das gilt auch für Renaturierungen. Herausgeber Lauterbornia 72 / 2011 Im Zusammenhang mit der WRRL-Umsetzung legt die Analyse der vielfältigen Belastungen der Fließgewässer nahe, sich zukünftig auf Maßnahmen zu konzentrieren, die eine hydromorphologische Verbesserung der Gewässer zum Ziel haben. Vor diesem Hintergrund hat dieser Band 13 aus der Reihe Limnologie Aktuell zum Ziel, Konzeption, Durchführung und Effizienz aktuell in Deutschland durchgeführter und geplanter Renaturierungen vorzustellen. Anhand von Projekten zu verschiedenen Gewässertypen, Nutzungsformen und Landschaftsräumen lassen eine Vielzahl von Autoren einen Überblick über verschiedenste Planungsobjekte und Maßnahmenkonzepte entstehen. Des Weiteren werden die großräumige Konzeption und Priorisierung von Renaturierungsmaßnahmen diskutiert, Konzeptionen für größere Gebiete vorgestellt und die Randbedingungen für den Erfolg von Renaturierungen diskutiert.

Metals play numerous critical roles in natural and anthropogenic characteristics of lake ecosystems, so patterns in the historical records of metals from sedimentary cores provide important information about environmental baselines and human impacts. Relevant studies of Great Lakes geochemistry are listed, and we follow with encyclopedic descriptions of metals and their oxides in the lakes. These descriptions include likely natural and anthropogenic sources of elements, their known history from previous paleoecological studies, and their status as potential contaminants of concern. Despite the well-studied geology of the Great Lakes catchment, sourcing elements was sometimes difficult due to materials often being moved long distances by glaciation and the global prevalence of atmospheric pollutants. We summarized available information on metals and their roles as geochemical indicators in the Great Lakes.},

	abstract = {Researchers worldwide are studying the environmental distribution and impacts of manufactured or environmentally fragmented small pieces of plastics, so called microplastics ({\textless}5 mm). These microplastics eventually build up in the marine environment, threatening marine ecosystems. The magnitude, fate and effects of these microplastics across the food web are largely unknown. Here, we measured digested microplastics in a top predator and critically endangered species, the North-East Atlantic Porbeagle shark (Lamna nasus), and compared this with general health conditions. A method for quantifying microplastics in spiral valves of porbeagle sharks was developed. Microplastics were detected in all spiral valves, up to 10.4 particles per g wet weight (w.w.) content and 9.5 particles per g w.w. tissue. This equates to individual microplastics loads as high as 3850 particles per spiral valve, most likely a result of trophic transfer. No statistically significant correlations were found between the average number of plastic particles in spiral valve content and tissue and the Condition and Hepatosomatic Index of porbeagle sharks. The results of this research show that North-East Atlantic porbeagle sharks ingest and digest microplastics and that there is a potential for microplastic biomonitoring using this species. More research is needed to detect possible health effects of microplastic contamination in these apex predators.},

	abstract = {Environmental DNA analysis has revolutionized the way we study rare, invasive, and endangered taxa. However, if eDNA testing is to become an increasingly reliable tool, high detection sensitivity is crucial. Current eDNA sampling methods, like filtration and precipitation, can only process small volumes of water per sample. If only a few samples are collected, eDNA from the target organism might be missed, leading to false‐negative results. We developed an eDNA collection method for lentic systems that improved detection sensitivity while keeping the total number of samples low. Unlike filtration and precipitation, which mainly target extracellular DNA, this method specifically targets eDNA in larger particle sizes and is not limited to processing small volumes of water. A 64‐micrometer mesh tow net was used to process {\textgreater}3,000 L of water per eDNA sample. We compared the tow net method to a common collection method, a 0.45 μm cellulose nitrate filter that processes about 1 L of water per eDNA sample. Paired tow and filter samples were collected at 37 locations and tested for two taxa: an aquatic plant, Northern watermilfoil (Myriophyllum sibiricum), and aquatic mollusks, including Helisoma anceps, using Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays. We detected M. sibiricum significantly more frequently in tow samples than filter samples. Mollusks were detected in all eDNA samples (tow nets and filters), but when eDNA samples were diluted 25‐fold to mimic a low target concentration scenario, mollusk DNA was detected significantly more frequently in tow samples than filter samples. This high‐volume eDNA sampling method, using a tow net to process thousands of liters of water, can improve detection sensitivity for multiple taxa, making it a useful tool for researchers and managers.},

Here, we report the range expansion and first occurrence of the Japanse seahorse, Hippocampus mohnkei (Bleeker, 1853) from the Mandovi esturaine ecosystem of Goa, central west coast of India (CWCI) based on morpho-molecularanalyses. The morphometric and meristic traits particularly, short snout length (29-35\% head length), double cheek spine, low coronet and long tail (51.2-57.9\% of standard length), 11 trunk rings, 37-39 tail rings, 15-16 dorsal and 12-14 fin rays observed in four collected specimens matched with the reported key diagnostic morphologival criteria of vouchered specimens of H. mohnkei. The seahorse mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cyt b) genes were partially sequenced for conclusive genetic identification of the species under study. Molecular analysis showed that all four individuals of seahorse species clustered together suggesting a monophyletic lineage. Using the maximum similarity with GenBank database, maximum likelihood network and subsequent morphological analysis, the identity of the collected seahorse species was reconfirmed as H. mohnikei. With this new report, the geographic range of H. mohnikei extended significantly to the westward side from its previously known range. This new sighting of H. mohnikei could indicate a long-distance dispersal facilitated by due to prevailing oceanic circulation in the Indo-Pacific region or increased habitat suitability in bay-estuarine systems of Goa, CWCI. Comparison of the pair-wise genetic distances (Kimura 2-parameter) based on COI and Cyt b sequences revealed that the specimens examined in this study are genetically closer to H. mohnikei populations from Vietnam and Thailand than they are to those in Japan and China. To test the hypothesis whether H. mohnikei are vagrants or previously unreported established population, long-term inter-annual sampling and analyses are warranted.

Since earthworms lack adaptive immunity, we determined Cd-related effects on coelomocytes, the cellular part of innate immunity, which is also the site of detoxification processes. A proteomics approach revealed a set of immunity-related proteins as well as gene products involved in energy metabolism changing in earthworms in response to Cd exposure. Based on these results, we conducted extracellular flux measurements of oxygen and acidification to reveal the effect of Cd on coelomocyte metabolism. We observed a significantly changing oxygen consumption rate, extracellular acidification, as well as metabolic potential, which can be defined as the response to an induced energy demand. Acute changes in intracellular calcium levels were also observed, indicating impaired coelomocyte activation. Lysosomes, the cell protein recycling center, and mitochondrial parameters did not change. Taken together, we were able to characterize coelomocyte metabolism to reveal a potential link to an impaired immune system upon Cd exposure.},

	abstract = {Lake Łebsko is the largest and most productive coastal lake of the southern Baltic Sea to which it is permanently connected. The shoreline is well-developed, and the lake is divided into three parts: eastern, central, and western. Seawater intrusion affects most strongly the eastern part, where the Łeba River connects it with the sea. Samples of water and sediments were collected in 2014–2015. In the same places and time interval, bottom fauna was collected to determine the influence of environmental predictors on its qualitative-quantitative structure. Metals Cr (chromium), Pb (lead), Ni (nickel), Cu (copper), and Al (aluminium) in the samples were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Most of the analyzed physicochemical variables of water were significantly higher in the eastern part: conductivity, salinity, sulfates (p {\textless} 0.0001) and chlorides (p = 0.01). Metal concentrations in water did not differ significantly between the lake parts, but in sediments they were generally higher in the western part. During the study, we detected significant changes in descriptors and abundance of the major groups of benthic fauna (Oligochaeta and Diptera), mostly between the eastern and western parts. BIO-ENV analysis showed that the benthic community of Lake Łebsko is shaped primarily by physicochemical variables of water (42\% of the variance), linked with intrusion of seawater. Secondarily, the structure of the benthic community is affected by the amounts of heavy metals in sediments (31\%) and water (12\%). The findings can help us improve the principles of management of coastal lakes, including modification of hydrological conditions.},

Except Soil properties and metal(loid)s content, the richness and diversity of microbial communities in soil samples were analyzed via high-throughput Illumina sequencing of 16s rRNA gene amplicons. The results showed that the content of As, Pb, Cu, Cd, Zn, and Mn was relatively high in top soil in comparison to subsoil, while the concentration of Cr in subsoil was comparable with that in top soil due to its relative high background value in this soil layer. The bioavailability of Cd, Mn, Zn, and Pb was relative higher than that of As, Cr, and Cu. The diversity of soil microbial communities decreased with increasing depth, which might be ascribed to the decrease in evenness with increase in depth duo to the influence by environmental conditions, such as pH, TK (total potassium), CEC (cation exchange capacity), ORP (oxidation reduction potential), and Bio-Cu (bioavailable copper). The results also found Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Chloroflexi were dominant phyla in soil samples. At the genus level, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, and Gp7 were dominant soil microorganism. Besides, Environmental factors, such as SOM (soil organic matter), pH, Bio-Cu, Bio-Cd (bioavailable cadmium), and Bio-Pb (bioavailable lead), greatly impacted microbial community in surface soil (1–3 m), while ORP, TK, and AN concentration influenced microbial community in the subsoil (4–10 m).},

Three UV filters (BP-3, OC and BM-DBM) and two stabilizers (UV-328 and UV-329) were found in some of the studied species, in concentrations ranging between 0.067 and 0.683 µg g−1 dry weight (dw). BP-3 (UV filter) was the most frequently detected compound, followed by UV-329 (UV stabilizer). Thunnus thynnus was the most heavily polluted species, with a concentration of 1.201 µg g−1 dw as the sum of all measured compounds.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a combined approach wherein the optical, near-infrared, and thermal infrared data from the Landsat 8 satellite and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) global digital elevation model (GDEM) data are fused for soil moisture mapping under sparse sampling conditions, based on the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) framework. The study was conducted in three stages. First, based on the maximum entropy principle of the information theory, a Lagrange multiplier was introduced to construct general knowledge, representing prior knowledge. Second, a principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to extract three principal components from the multi-source data mentioned above, and an innovative and operable discrete probability method based on a fuzzy probability matrix was used to approximate the probability relationship. Thereafter, soft data were generated on the basis of the weight coefficients and coordinates of the soft data points. Finally, by combining the general knowledge with the prior information, hard data (HD), and soft data (SD), we completed the soil moisture mapping based on the Bayesian conditioning rule. To verify the feasibility of the combined approach, the ordinary kriging (OK) method was taken as a comparison. The results confirmed the superiority of the soil moisture map obtained using the BME framework. The map revealed more detailed information, and the accuracies of the quantitative indicators were higher compared with that for the OK method (the root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.0423 cm3/cm3, mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.0399 cm3/cm3, and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) = 0.7846), while largely overcoming the overestimation issue in the range of low values and the underestimation issue in the range of high values. The proposed approach effectively fused inexpensive and easily available multi-source data with uncertainties and obtained a satisfactory mapping accuracy, thus demonstrating the potential of the BME framework for soil moisture mapping using multi-source data.},

Fusconaia flava is considered widespread and relatively common while P. sintoxia is considered an imperiled species. These species are similar in shell shape and coloration and have confounded many freshwater malacologists, resulting in frequent misidentifications. We sought to determine if morphometric analyses could be used to reliably distinguish between these species. Two hundred and forty-six specimens were collected from rivers in Michigan and Ontario. For each specimen, a preliminary identification was made, shell measurements and foot color (orange or white) were documented, and photos of the left shell valve were taken. A genetic sample was taken from 133 specimens for cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) barcoding. COI sequences were used for species identification by comparing to sequences on GenBank. Twenty-one digitized landmarks along the outline of the left valve were analyzed and compared to the results of the DNA barcoding. Landmark data correctly assigned 99.2\% of specimens to their DNA-confirmed species identity, compared to 82.0\% accuracy of field identifications and 77.0\% accuracy for foot color. The creation of a DNA-confirmed morphometric database will aid freshwater malacologists across the Great Lakes region in differentiating between these species.},

	abstract = {As the primary energy and carbon source in aquatic food webs, phytoplankton generally display spatial heterogeneity due to complicated biotic and abiotic controls; however our understanding of the causes of this spatial heterogeneity is challenging, as it involves multiple regulatory mechanisms. We applied a combination of field observation, numerical modeling, and remote sensing to display and interpret the spatial gradient of phytoplankton biomass in a Dutch tidal bay (the Eastern Scheldt) on the east coast of the North Sea. The 19 years (1995–2013) of monitoring data reveal a seaward increasing trend in chlorophyll-a (chl a) concentrations during the spring bloom. Using a calibrated and validated three-dimensional hydrodynamic–biogeochemical model, two idealized model scenarios were run: switching off the suspension feeders and halving the open-boundary nutrient and phytoplankton loading. Results reveal that bivalve grazing exerts a dominant control on phytoplankton in the bay and that the tidal import mainly influences algal biomass near the mouth. Satellite data captured a post-bloom snapshot that indicated the temporally variable phytoplankton distribution. Based on a literature review, we found five common spatial phytoplankton patterns in global estuarine–coastal ecosystems for comparison with the Eastern Scheldt case: seaward increasing, seaward decreasing, concave with a chlorophyll maximum, weak spatial gradients, and irregular patterns. We highlight the temporal variability of these spatial patterns and the importance of anthropogenic and environmental influences.},

Seafood processing by-products (SPBs) and microalgae are promising resources that can fill the demand gap for proteins and protein derivatives. Globally, 32 million tonnes of SPBs are estimated to be produced annually which represents an inexpensive resource for protein recovery while technical advantages in microalgal biomass production would yield secure protein supplies with minimal competition for arable land and freshwater resources. Moreover, these biomaterials are a rich source of proteins with high nutritional quality while protein hydrolysates and biopeptides derived from these marine proteins possess several useful bioactivities for commercial applications in multiple industries. Efficient utilisation of these marine biomaterials for protein recovery would not only supplement global demand and save natural bioresources but would also successfully address the financial and environmental burdens of biowaste, paving the way for greener production and a circular economy. This comprehensive review analyses the potential of using SPBs and microalgae for protein recovery and production critically assessing the feasibility of current and emerging technologies used for the process development. Nutritional quality, functionalities, and bioactivities of the extracted proteins and derived products together with their potential applications for commercial product development are also systematically summarised and discussed.},

For this purpose, 83 relevant publications (mainly articles in international journals) were analyzed. It was found that investigation of Cd in the tourism environment took place in all continents (except Antarctica) and has intensified since the mid-2000s; Chinese researchers are the most active contributors. The Cd occurrence in air, living organisms, sediments, soil, suspended particular matter, water, and of the human environment has been studied. It has become clear that tourism contributes to Cd pollution (particularly, by hotel wastewater and increased traffic), and, vice versa, Cd pollution of beaches, coastal waters, food, urban parks, etc. creates risks for tourists and increases human exposure to this toxic metal. Both mechanisms have received equal attention. Examples concern many places worldwide, with the Mediterranean and Central and Eastern Europe as apparently critical regions. Our significantly incomplete knowledge of the relationships between cadmium and tourism must be ascribed to the common oversimplification of these relationships and to the scarcity or even absence of information supplied by the most important tourist destinations. The present review demonstrates that more studies of heavy metals and, particularly, Cd in the tourism environment are needed.},

The composition of the mineral feed additive (MFA) included mussel leaves and seawater, the protein-mineral feed additive (PMFA) - the leaves of large and the body of small mussels, seaweed Phyllophora nervosa and seawater. The determination of blood serum indices was performed using an automatic biochemical analyzer GBG ChemWell2910 (USA) and the use of test systems Global Scientific (USA). According to the results of biochemical studies of the broiler chickens' blood serum, the diet of which was supplemented with feed additives, there was established an increase in the total protein content, incl. albumin and globulin. Compared with MFA, the use of PMFA to a greater extent increased the content of total protein, albumin, and globulin. The total protein content changes and its fractions occurred due to an increase in the activity of transamination enzymes: alanine and aspartate aminotransferase and the absence of changes in glucose content. Due to the relatively smaller increase in the amount of albumin compared to globulin, the albumin-globulin ratio in the chickens of the experimental groups was lower. Among the globulin fractions, the greatest changes were observed in the relative content of á2 -globulins. Based on the results of the research, a conclusion was drawn on the stimulating effect of feed additives of marine aquatic organisms on the protein metabolism condition of broiler chickens.},

	abstract = {Ruditapes decussatus is a native clam from the Southern Europe and Mediterranean area, relevant to the development of sustainable aquaculture in these regions. As sessile organisms, bivalves are likely to be exposed to chemical contaminations and environmental changes in the aquatic compartment and are widely used as bioindicator species. Carbon-based nanomaterials (CNTs) use is increasing and, consequently, concentrations of these contaminants in aquatic systems will rise. Therefore, it is imperative to assess the potential toxic effects of such compounds and the interactions with environmental factors such as water temperature. For this, we exposed R. decussatus clams to four different water temperatures (10, 15, 20 and 25 °C) in the presence or absence of CNTs for 96 h. Different parameters related with oxidative stress status, aerobic metabolism, energy reserves and neurotoxicity were evaluated. The relationship and differences among water temperatures and contamination were highlighted by principal coordinates analysis (PCO). CNTs exposure increased oxidative damage as protein carbonylation (PC) in exposed clams at 10 °C. Higher temperatures (25 °C) were responsible for the highest redox status (ratio between reduced and oxidized glutathione, GSH/GSSG) observed as well as neurotoxic effects (acetylcholinesterase—AChE activity). Antioxidant defenses were also modulated by the combination of CNTs exposure with water temperatures, with decrease of glutathione peroxidase (GR) activity at 15 °C and of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) activity at 20 °C, when compared with unexposed clams. Clams energy reserves were not altered, probably due to the short exposure period. Overall, the combined effects of CNTs exposure and increasing water temperatures can impair R. decussatus cellular homeostasis inducing oxidative stress and damage.},

Several toxic metals already appear in the list of priority substances polluting surface waters, while concerns arise from the increasing use of technology-critical metals such as metallic nanoparticles, rare-earth, and platinum group metals. In aquatic environments, various chemical, biological and physical processes determine the impact of metals on the biota. This review provides insights into responses to toxic metals recently reported in freshwater and marine animals. The specific emphasis is on: (i) common cellular and molecular responses; (ii) stress proteins; (iii) redox homeostasis; (iv) cytoskeleton rearrangement; (v) metabolism reshuffle; (vi) free cellular energy and mitochondrial metabolism; and (vi) immunity. These endpoints are promising, notably in multi-biomarker approaches to identify precise cellular toxicity pathways and anticipate the impact of environmental metal pollution.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12989-020-00358-y},
	abstract = {Given the global abundance and environmental persistence, exposure of humans and (aquatic) animals to micro- and nanoplastics is unavoidable. Current evidence indicates that micro- and nanoplastics can be taken up by aquatic organism as well as by mammals. Upon uptake, micro- and nanoplastics can reach the brain, although there is limited information regarding the number of particles that reaches the brain and the potential neurotoxicity of these small plastic particles.
Earlier studies indicated that metal and metal-oxide nanoparticles, such as gold (Au) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles, can also reach the brain to exert a range of neurotoxic effects. Given the similarities between these chemically inert metal(oxide) nanoparticles and plastic particles, this review aims to provide an overview of the reported neurotoxic effects of micro- and nanoplastics in different species and in vitro. The combined data, although fragmentary, indicate that exposure to micro- and nanoplastics can induce oxidative stress, potentially resulting in cellular damage and an increased vulnerability to develop neuronal disorders. Additionally, exposure to micro- and nanoplastics can result in inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity and altered neurotransmitter levels, which both may contribute to the reported behavioral changes.
Currently, a systematic comparison of the neurotoxic effects of different particle types, shapes, sizes at different exposure concentrations and durations is lacking, but urgently needed to further elucidate the neurotoxic hazard and risk of exposure to micro- and nanoplastics.},

Using δ(34S/32S) stable isotope ratios and the concentrations of S and SO42−, we measured the SO42− influx rate (Jin), net flux (Jnet), and efflux rate (Jout) during a 24 h exposure period. For all four species, the means of Jin for SO42− were positive, and Jin was significantly greater than 0 at both target SO42− concentrations in the fish and mollusk and at the lower SO42− concentration in the crayfish. The means of Jout and Jnet were much more variable than those for Jin, but several species by target SO42− concentration combinations for Jout and Jnet, were negative, which suggests the net excretion of SO42− by the animals. The results of our experiments suggest a greater regulation of SO42− in freshwater animals than has been previously reported.},

In this study, the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of water quality and algae community in Nanjing city were investigated with microscopic examination for one year. Results showed that the water pollution in this area was mainly related to high concentration of nitrogen (NH3-N and TN (Total nitrogen). There was a total of 77 species of algae in the studied rivers from June 2016 to May 2017, among which 73 species of planktic algae and 34 species of epipelic algae, in which the abundance and biomass of the latter were 1925 and 904 times that of the former, respectively. The two kinds of algae had different change tendencies which were related to seasons. For planktic algae, the abundance and biomass decreased in this season sequence: summer, spring, autumn, and winter. For epipelic algae, the abundance and biomass were relatively higher in winter. The dominant community of planktic algae was Chlorophyta-Bacillariophyceae-Cyanobacteria type, while that of epipelic algae was Bacillariophyceae—Cyanobacteria type. Most of the present algae were bi-trophic species, and were tightly related to the pollution characteristics of the rivers. The key environmental factors for planktic algae are T, TN, and TP, and those for Epipelic algae are N:P and TN. The relation between the community composition of planktic and epipelic algae and environmental parameters are highly complex, and it is worth carrying out further study to clarify their interaction mechanism.},

The blue mussels farmed along the Swedish coastline in the Baltic Sea are, due to their small size, exclusively used to produce feed for chicken and fish in the agro–aqua cycle. We have investigated the possible biotransfer of BMAA from mussels, via mussel-based feed, into chickens. Chickens were divided into two groups, the control and the treatment. BMAA was extracted from the muscle, liver, brain, and eye tissues in both chicken groups; a UPLC-MS/MS method was subsequently used to quantify BMAA. The results indicate detectable concentrations of BMAA in both chicken groups. However, the BMAA concentration in chicken was 5.65 times higher in the treatment group than the control group, with the highest concentration found in muscle tissue extracted from the treatment group chickens. These data suggest that there is a BMAA transfer route within the agro-aqua cycle, so further investigation is recommended before using mussel-based feed in the chicken industry.},

Toxicity of neonicotinoid active ingredients and formulations on Daphnia magna completed with some investigations of activity of the detoxifying glutathione S-transferase enzyme demonstrated the modified toxicity due to the formulating agents. Electrophysiological results on identified central neurons of the terrestrial snail Helix pomatia showed acetylcholine antagonist (inhibitory) effects of neonicotinoid insecticide products, but no agonist (ACh-like) effects were recorded.

To determine effects of long-term exposure to environmentally relevant levels on nontarget organisms, we analysed cardiac and locomotor responses of signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus to acute stress during a 21-day exposure to METH at 1 μg L−1 followed by 14 days depuration. Heart rate and locomotion were recorded over a period of 30 min before and 30 min after exposure to haemolymph of an injured conspecific four times during METH exposure and four times during the depuration phase. Methamphetamine-exposed crayfish showed a weaker cardiac response to stress than was observed in controls during both exposure and depuration phases. Similarly, methamphetamine-exposed crayfish, during METH exposure, showed lower locomotor reaction poststressor application in contrast to controls. Results indicate biological alterations in crayfish exposed to METH at low concentration level, potentially resulting in a shift in interactions among organisms in natural environment.},

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is globally recognized as a persistent chemical contaminant that accumulates in marine biota, thus constituting an ecological hazard, as well as a health risk to seafood consumers. Climate change-related stressors may influence the bioaccumulation, detoxification, and toxicity of chemical contaminants, such as Hg. Yet, the potential interactions between environmental stressors and contaminants, as well as their impacts on marine organisms and seafood safety, are still unclear. Hence, the aim of this work was to assess the bioaccumulation of Hg and neuro-oxidative responses on the commercial flat fish species Solea senegalensis (muscle, liver, and brain) co-exposed to dietary Hg in its most toxic form (i.e., MeHg), seawater warming (ΔT°C = +4 °C), and acidification (pCO2 = +1000 µatm, equivalent to ΔpH = −0.4 units). In general, fish liver exhibited the highest Hg concentration, followed by brain and muscle. Warming enhanced Hg bioaccumulation, whereas acidification decreased this element’s levels. Neuro-oxidative responses to stressors were affected by both climate change-related stressors and Hg dietary exposure. Hazard quotient (HQ) estimations evidenced that human exposure to Hg through the consumption of fish species may be aggravated in tomorrow’s ocean, thus raising concerns from the seafood safety perspective.},

Raw Pisidium coreanum, a freshwater bivalve of the phylum Mollusca, is used in traditional therapies in parts of Asia. However, the therapeutic effects of Pisidium coreanum on bone diseases are not known. We investigated the functional roles of Pisidium coreanum in osteoporotic bone diseases. Pisidium coreanum inhibited the differentiation of bone marrow-derived monocytic cells into mature osteoclasts in vitro. The ovariectomized mice that received oral administration of Pisidium coreanum showed improvements in both trabecular and cortical bones. This preventive activity of Pisidium coreanum against bone loss was due to limited osteoclast maturation with reduced osteoclast surface extent in trabecular bone tissue. The formation of large multinucleated osteoclasts in vitro was significantly decreased in response to Pisidium coreanum, consistent with the reduced expression levels of osteoclast markers and fusion-related genes, such as NFATc1, p65, integrin αvβ3, DC-STAMP, OC-STAMP, Atp6v0d2, FAK, CD44, and MFR. These data suggest that Pisidium coreanum inhibits osteoclast differentiation by negatively regulating the fusion of mononuclear osteoclast precursors. Thus, our data demonstrate the ability of Pisidium coreanum to effectively prevent estrogen-deficient osteoporosis through inhibition of multinucleated osteoclast formation.},

	abstract = {The artificial lighting of caves adapted for touristic visits, leads to the appearance and propagation of a complex community of phototrophic organisms known as "lampenflora". Formed mainly by algae and cyanobacteria, they produce the degradation of the colonized substrates and decrease the show value of the caves. This phenomenon became famous worldwide in the 1960s due to the damage caused to the paintings in the Lascaux Cave (France). Since then it has become an issue of serious concern to both managers of show caves and to the international scientific community. Over time, the problem has been approached following two complementary strategies: preventing colonization by the invading organisms or eliminating them once they have become established through the use of chemical products, mainly biocides and strong oxidants. This kind of treatment generates pollutant effluents that can move the problem from the walls of the caves to the groundwater. This paper presents a critical literature review of the problem and the proposed solutions, and emphasizes the need for further study of the optimal doses of treatment chemicals and to develop quantitative methods to determine their effectiveness.},

	abstract = {The importance of nest characteristics for birds breeding in the extreme climate conditions of polar regions, has been greatly understudied. Nest parameters, like nest orientation, exposure and insulation, could strongly influence microclimate and protection against precipitation of the nest, thereby affecting breeding success. A burrow nesting seabird, the Wilson’s storm-petrel (Oceanites oceanicus) is an excellent model species to investigate the importance of nest characteristics, as it is the smallest endotherm breeding in the Antarctic. Here, we investigated the effects of nest parameters such as internal nest dimensions, nest micro-topography and thermal properties of the nest burrow and the influence of weather conditions on breeding output, measured as hatching success, chick survival, and chick growth. We collected data during the austral summers of 2017 and 2018, on King George Island, maritime Antarctica. Our results showed that the thermal microclimate of the nest burrow was significantly improved by a small entrance size, a low nest height, and insulation and tended to be enhanced by a low wind exposition index and an eastern nest site orientation. In addition, an eastern nest site orientation significantly reduced the chance of snow blocking. However, the relationships between nest characteristics and breeding output were complex and might be affected by other parameters like food availability and parental quality. The relation between chick growth and nest air temperature remained especially indistinct. Nevertheless, our results indicate that nest characteristics that enhance the thermal microclimate and reduce the risk of snow blocking favoured both hatching success and chick survival. Due to climate change in the Antarctic, snowfall is expected to increase in the future, which will likely enhance the importance of nest characteristics that determine snow blocking. Additionally, despite global warming, thermally favourable nest burrows will likely still be advantageous in the highly variable and challenging Antarctic climate.},

	abstract = {In this study, we demonstrated the presence of the enzymatic complex able to perform aromatization (estrogen synthesis) in both, the microsomal and mitochondrial fractions of gills and gonads from Mytilus trossulus. Based on in vitro experiments, we highlighted the importance of temperature as the limiting factor of aromatisation efficiency (AE) in mussels. After testing range of temperatures (4–23 °C), the highest AE was found during incubation at 8 °C and pH 7.6 (41.66 pmol/h/mg protein in gills and 58.37 pmol/h/mg protein in gonads). The results were confirmed during field studies where the most efficient aromatisation occurred in bivalves collected in spring while the least effective in those collected in winter. During in vitro studies, AE turned out to be more intensive in female gonads than in male gonads. The process was also more intensive in mitochondrial fraction than in microsomal one (62.97 pmol/h/mg protein in male gills and 73.94 pmol/h/mg protein in female gonads). Enzymatic complex (aromatase-like enzyme) catalysing aromatisation in mussels was found to be insensitive to inhibitory effect of selective inhibitors of mammalian aromatase such as letrozole and anastrazole, suggesting its different structure from vertebrate aromatase. Further in vivo studies using 13C-labeled steroids at 8 °C temperature window confirmed that bivalves are able to uptake testosterone and androstenedione from the ambient environment and metabolise them to estrone and 17β-estradiol thus confirming endogenous estrogen’ synthesis.},

To date, metabolic characteristics among the phylogenetic distant epigean and hypogean species (i.e., species of different genera) or the epigean and hypogean populations of the same species have been studied due to little opportunity to compare closely related epigean and hypogean species. To fill this gap, we studied the epigean Niphargus zagrebensis and its troglobiotic relative Niphargus stygius, and the epigean subspecies Asellus aquaticus carniolicus in comparison to the troglobiotic subspecies Asellus aquaticus cavernicolus. We tested the previous findings of different metabolic rates obtained on less-appropriate pairs of species and provide additional information on thermal characteristics of metabolic enzymes in both species or subspecies types. Measurements were done at four temperatures. The values of studied traits, i.e., oxygen consumption, ETS activity, and ratio R/ETS, did not differ significantly between species or subspecies of the same genus from epigean and hypogean habitats, but they responded differently to temperature changes. Higher Q10-values for oxygen consumption of N. stygius than N. zagrebensis in the temperature range 10-20C and higher Ea indicated higher thermal sensitivity in the subterranean species. On the other hand, lower Q10 and Ea-values for ETS activity of N. stygius than N. zagrebensis indicated more thermally stable enzymatic machinery in N. stygius than N. zagrebensis. In Asellus, we observed a similar trend of lower Ea for oxygen consumption and higher Ea for ETS activity in epigean than the troglomorphic subspecies, but the values did not differ significantly between the two. Our most important conclusion is that the low metabolic rate is not a universal property of troglobiotic animals, and the degree of metabolic adaptation is not necessarily in agreement with the degree of morphological adaptation (troglomorphy).},

A key issue in understanding the fate and potential effects of micro- and nano-sized plastics is their dynamic nature, as the size, shape, and charge of the particles change over time. Moreover, due to various biological processes, such as the aggregation of organic material and/or bacteria (“biofouling”), the density of plastic particles that settle in the sediments of aquatic ecosystems may be several orders of magnitudes higher than that in the surrounding waters. Consequently, the risk posed by plastic pollution to benthic fauna is considerably high. Nonetheless, the vast majority of studies examining the effects of microplastics have focused on pelagic organisms so far. We therefore conducted a comprehensive literature review to examine the impact of micro- and nano-sized plastics on benthic invertebrates, including the physical and chemical effects of leaching and the interactions of plastic particles with contaminants. Overall, 330 papers were reviewed for their fulfilment of different criteria (e.g. test species, plastic material, particle shape, particle size, exposure concentration, exposure route, assay type, assay duration), with 49 publications finally included in our survey. A comprehensive gap-analysis on the effects of plastic particles on benthic invertebrates, revealed a wide variety of effects triggered by micro- and/or nano-sized plastics but also distinct differences regarding the plastic materials tested, the size fractions applied, the shape of the respective particles and the exposure routes tested. Our review concludes with a discussion of the important research gaps concerning freshwater ecosystems and recommendations for future areas of research.},

	abstract = {The emerging shift in Great Lakes management from offshore to nearshore waters will require attention to complexities of coastal hydrodynamics and biogeochemical transformations. Emphasizing hydrodynamics, this work resolves transport processes in quantifying discharge plume and pollutant of concern (POC) footprint dimensions, the latter being the portion of the plume where water quality standards are not met. A generic approach, isolated from pollutant-specific biokinetics, provides first-approximation estimates of the footprint area. A high-resolution, linked hydrodynamic-tracer model is applied at a site in the Greater Toronto Area on Lake Ontario. Model results agree with observed meteorological and hydrodynamic conditions and satisfactorily simulate plume dimensions. Footprints are examined in the context of guidelines for regulatory mixing zone size and attendant loss of beneficial use. We demonstrate that the ratio of the water quality standard to the POC concentration at discharge is a key determinant of footprint dimensions. Footprint size for traditional pollutants (ammonia, total phosphorus) meets regulatory guidelines; however, that for soluble reactive phosphorus, a presently unattended pollutant, is {\textasciitilde}1–2 orders of magnitude larger. This suggests that it may be necessary to upgrade treatment technologies to maintain consistency with regulatory guidelines and mitigate manifestations of the eutrophication-related soluble reactive phosphorus POC.},

	abstract = {Learning to read is a complex process for a hearing preschooler, requiring they master a variety of preliteracy skills. Prior research with hearing children indicates that parental engagement and child-initiated behaviors strongly influence a child’s reading trajectory and may act as a protective factor (Schweinhart, 1997; Skibbe, Bindman, Hindman, Aram \& Morrison, 2013; Robins, Treiman \& Rosales, 2014; Tang \& Davis-Kean, 2015; Robson, 2016a). Deaf and Hard of Hearing (D/HH) readers have inherent blocks that prohibit early access to their parents language, which consequently causes delays in the development of a first language, scaffolding for child-initiated behaviors, and learning to read. The relationship between specific parental engagement strategies, child-initiated behaviors and their influence on early pre-reading skills, such as alphabet knowledge, has remained relatively unexplored in Deaf and hard of hearing children. Therefore, the current study explored how parental engagement strategies and child-initiated behaviors correlate with alphabet knowledge (Whitehurst \& Lonigan, 1998; Paris, 2005; NELP, 2008; Puranik, Petscher \& Lonigan, 2012). Results were non-significant for reading to self or others, letter play and use of labels in the home. Modest gains were found for looking at picture books or other books, use of a computer, shared reading and fingerspelling items in the home. Children of Deaf parents who signed and hearing/hard of hearing parents who did not sign had the best alphabet knowledge outcomes. Additionally, children with higher levels of ASL proficiency performed significantly better on a measure of alphabet knowledge. These findings can be useful as a springboard for directing future research to the most effective reading interventions for D/HH children.},

	abstract = {Continental aquatic ecosystems play a fundamental role in economic and social development; however, they are vulnerable to environmental degradation due to the various stresses to which they are submitted. Aquaculture is among the main anthropic activities that influence these environments. Mathematical modelling of aquatic ecosystems performed using a set of computational tools allows simplified representation of environment regarding its biotic and abiotic components. Some of the most used techniques are: hydrodynamic modelling, focusing on the dispersion of nutrients; nutrient-mass balance modelling, especially phosphorus; bioenergetic modelling in animal production systems, with an estimate of the generation of residues in the environment by farmed animals; and trophic and ecological modelling, focusing on aquatic communities and their interactions. These techniques help understand changes caused by aquaculture systems in aquatic environments. In this way, it is possible to estimate the magnitude and extent of the impacts of these activities by simulating the possible environmental changes over time. It can be concluded that techniques involving mathematical modelling can provide relevant information for future impacts prediction on aquatic environments, promoting the management of water resources and their multiple uses.Alternate abstract: Ecossistemas aquáticos continentais desempenham papel fundamental no desenvolvimento econômico e social, entretanto, são vulneráveis à degradação ambiental devido às diversas pressões a que estão submetidos.

A modelagem matemática de ecossistemas aquáticos permite a representação simplificada do ambiente, em seus componentes bióticos e abióticos, através de um conjunto de ferramentas computacionais. Neste contexto, entre as técnicas mais utilizadas estão a modelagem hidrodinâmica, com foco na dispersão de nutrientes; a modelagem do balanço de massa de nutrientes, em especial o fósforo; a modelagem bioenergética em sistemas de produção animal, com estimativa da geração de resíduos pelos animais de cultivo para o ambiente; e a modelagem trófica e ecológica, com foco nas comunidades aquáticas e suas interações. Estas técnicas auxiliam no entendimento das alterações provocadas por sistemas de aquicultura em ambientes aquáticos. Deste modo, é possível estimar a magnitude e extensão dos impactos destas atividades, simulando as possíveis alterações ambientais ao longo do tempo.

Through the material remains of daily practice and repetitive actions, identity markers tied to adornment, technological traditions, and culinary practices are compared between 14 assemblages to test four identity models. Seventeenth-century colonists were eating a combination of Old World domesticates and wild game on colonoware and majolica serving vessels, cooking using Indigenous pottery, grinding with Puebloan style tools, and conducting household scale production and prospecting. While assemblages are consistent in basic composition, variations are present tied to socioeconomic status. This blending of material culture into a new set of identity markers points to a self-sufficient, household-based settlement pattern linked throughout the region, representing the transition over time from a broader New Spain material culture package to a New Mexico colonial identity package, which eventually developed into the modern Nuevo Mexicano identity.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this paper is to provide information on the risks posed by metal nanoparticles released into surface waters. Introduction: Currently, the use of nanoparticles of metal and metal oxides (NPMOs) is extremely popular in various industries, and in medicine and households. Nanoparticles and nanocompounds have become significant contributors to technological progress due to their physicochemical properties such as the melting point, electrical and thermal conductivity, catalytic activity, light absorption and scattering, as well as biocompatible and bactericidal properties. These functions cause their increased performance compared to their macro counterparts. However, it should be noted that the properties of nanocomponents can create new risks to the environment and consumers. Based on existing literature, a conclusion can be drawn that metal nanoparticles are a potential threat to plant and animal organisms, and humans. It is, therefore, necessary to intensify efforts to understand the mobility, reactivity and durability of nanocomponents in various environmental components, especially in the aquatic environment, and their toxicity to organisms. Methodology: This paper is a literature review. Conclusions: The increasing use of nanosubstances, in both commercial and industrial products, has caused an increasing concentration and diversity of these substances in aquatic ecosystems. Based on the analysis of literature reports, it can be concluded that the size of nanoparticles, their structure and arrangement, as well as surface properties, are subject to constant changes in the environment as a result of their interactions with other components, and of the balances shaped by a variety of geochemical and biological factors. Numerous studies conducted in recent years in the field of nanoecotoxicology have demonstrated the existence of a risk to aquatic organisms, which could lead to their impaired development and even death. Unfortunately, the lack of a standard technique for assessing the toxicity of nanoparticles in various biological systems, such as the reproductive, respiratory, nervous and gastrointestinal systems, and the developmental stages of aquatic organisms, makes it impossible to conduct such studies in a standardised fashion. Reports of the toxicity of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles in relation to various forms of living organisms warrant in-depth investigations into how these particles function in aqueous solutions and interact with standard substances.Alternate abstract:Cel: Celem artykułu jest przedstawienie informacji na temat zagrożeń, jakie stanowią nanocząstki metali wprowadzane do wód powierzchniowych. Wprowadzenie: Obecnie wykorzystanie nanocząstek metali i tlenków metali (NPMOs) cieszy się ogromną popularnością w różnych gałęziach przemysłu, medycynie i gospodarstwach domowych. Nanocząstki i nanozwiązki zyskały na znaczeniu w postępie technologicznym ze względu na swoje właściwości fizykochemiczne takie jak temperatura topnienia, przewodność elektryczna i cieplna, aktywność katalityczna, absorpcja i rozpraszanie światła oraz swoje biokompatybilne i bakteriobójcze własności. Cechy te powodują ich zwiększoną wydajność w stosunku do ich odpowiedników w skali makro. Należy jednak pamiętać, że właściwości, jakie posiadają nanozwiązki, mogą generować nowe ryzyko dla środowiska naturalnego oraz konsumentów. Analizując dotychczasową literaturę należy stwierdzić, że nanocząstki metali stanowią potencjalne zagrożenia dla organizmów roślinnych i zwierzęcych, w tym także człowieka. Konieczna jest zatem intensyfikacja prac, które pozwolą na zrozumienie mobilności, reaktywności i trwałości nanozwiązków w różnych komponentach środowiska, zwłaszcza w środowisku wodnym, oraz toksyczności w stosunku do organizmów. Metodologia: Artykuł został opracowany na podstawie przeglądu literatury z zakresu poruszanej tematyki. Wnioski: Rosnące wykorzystanie nanosubstancji, zarówno w produktach komercyjnych, jak i przemysłowych, determinuje coraz większe stężenie i różnorodność tych substancji w ekosystemach wodnych. Na podstawie analizy doniesień literaturowych należy stwierdzić, że wielkość nanocząstek, ich budowa i układ oraz właściwości powierzchni podlegają ciągłym zmianom w środowisku w wyniku interakcji z innymi składnikami i równowag kształtowanych przez różnorodne czynniki bio- i geochemiczne. Liczne badania przeprowadzone w ciągu ostatnich lat w dziedzinie nanoekotoksykologii wskazują na zagrożenie w stosunku do organizmów wodnych prowadzące do upośledzenia w rozwoju a nawet śmierci organizmów. Niestety, brak standardowej techniki oceny toksyczności nanocząstek w różnych układach biologicznych, takich jak układ rozrodczy, oddechowy, nerwowy, żołądkowo-jelitowy i stadia rozwojowe organizmów wodnych, powoduje brak możliwości standardowego prowadzenia takich badań. Doniesienia o toksyczności NPMOs w odniesieniu do różnych form organizmów żywych powodują, że niezbędna jest wiedza w zakresie ich funkcjonowania w roztworach wodnych oraz interakcji z podstawowymi substancjami.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to assess the pollution and potential ecological risk of seven heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in the sewage sludge collected from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), located in the most industrialized region of Poland (Silesian Voivodeship). The concentrations of heavy metals were determined using inductively coupled plasma optical spectrometry (ICP-OES) and cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CVAAS). The chemical forms (chemical speciation) of heavy metals were determined using the three-step chemical sequential extraction procedure, developed by the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR). To assess the pollution level and potential ecological risk, the following indices were used: Geoaccumulation Index (Igeo), Potential Ecological Risk Factor (ER), Individual Contamination Factor (ICF), modified Risk Assessment Code (RACm), and Ecological Risk Factor (ERF)—the author’s index. Sludge samples were collected at successive stages of processing. The results revealed that the activated sludge process and sludge thickening have a significant impact on heavy metal distribution, while anaerobic digestion and dehydration decrease their mobility. The most dominant metals in the sludge samples were Zn and Cu. However, the content of heavy metals in sewage sludge did not exceed the permissible standards for agricultural purposes. The concentrations of heavy metals bound to the immobile fractions exhibited higher concentrations, compared to those bound to mobile fractions (except Zn). The values of the total indices indicated that sludge samples were moderately to highly contaminated with Zn, Hg, Cd, Cu, and Pb, of which only Hg, Cd, and Cu posed a potential ecological risk, while according to the speciation indices, sludge samples were moderately to very highly polluted with Zn, Cu, Cd, Cr, and Ni, of which Zn, Ni, and Cd were environmentally hazardous. The obtained results proved that assessment of the pollution level and potential ecological risk of heavy metals in sewage sludge requires knowledge on both their total concentrations and their chemical forms. Such an approach will help prevent secondary pollution of soils with heavy metals, which may influence the reduction of health risks associated with the consumption of plants characterized by a high metal content.},

The purpose of this study was to determine if the selected coatings of silver nanoparticles (nAg) could influence the fate, bioavailability, and toxicity toward suspension feeding freshwater mussels, Elliptio complanata. Mussels were exposed for 96 h to 50 μg/L of nAg with the following surface coatings: citrate, silicate (Si), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), and branched polyethylenimine (bPEI). After the exposure period, mussels were analyzed for total Ag, resistance to air emersion, oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and autophagosome protein uptake (protein ubiquitinylation) in gills and digestive glands. The data revealed that citrate- and PVP-coated nAg were 2 times more abundant in the digestive gland compared to bPEI- and Si-coated nAg with estimated bioaccumulation factors between 5 and 10. The data revealed that tissue Ag levels were closely associated with air survival time, weight loss during air exposure, DNA strand breaks, LPO, and protein-ubiquitin levels in the digestive gland. The data supports the hypothesis that the coatings could influence bioavailability and toxicity in freshwater mussels.},

	abstract = {Background 
Perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure was found associated with atopic diseases. Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a childhood skin disorder. However, the effect of interaction between PFASs and glutathione S-transferase (GST) T1/M1 genotype on AD remains unclear.
Objective
To investigate the association between gene-environmental interaction and childhood AD using a birth cohort study.
Methods
From 2001 to 2005, 1,264 mother–newborn pairs were recruited from eight Taiwanese maternity hospitals. PFAS levels and Genotypes were analysed from cord blood. Information on children’s health status including AD occurrence was obtained via phone interviews at 6 months and 2 years. Cord plasma concentrations of nine PFASs were measured via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. GSTT1/M1 was genotyped (null/present) via polymerase chain reaction. Environment-gene interaction effects on AD were assessed using multiple logistic regression analysis.
Results
Overall, 839 mother–newborn pairs completed all measurements. The prevalence of ever having physician-diagnosed AD by 2 years of age was 5.4\%. Among PFASs, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was positively associated with AD adjusted for potential confounders. After grouping PFOA levels into three groups: undetected, below and above the median in those with detected, children in above the median group who had the GSTT1-null, or GSTM1-null genotype exhibited a higher odds ratio for AD (OR [95\%CI] = 3.45 [1.26–9.99] and 2.92 [1.12–7.91], respectively) as compared to the undetected group.
Conclusions
Our data demonstrated that in-utero PFOA exposure with GSTT1/M1 null genotype were associated with AD. Minimizing early-life PFAS exposure may help against AD development, especially in genetically susceptible individuals.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0209567},
	abstract = {Inherent differences between naturally-formed lakes and human-made reservoirs may play an important role in shaping zooplankton community structure. For example, because many reservoirs are created by impounding and managing lotic systems for specific human purposes, zooplankton communities may be affected by factors that are unique to reservoirs, such as shorter water residence times and a reservoir’s management regime, compared to natural lakes. However, the environmental factors that structure zooplankton communities in natural lakes vs. reservoirs may vary at the continental scale and remain largely unknown. We analyzed data from the 2007 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Lakes Assessment and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ National Inventory of Dams to compare large-bodied crustacean zooplankton communities (defined here as individuals retained by 0.243 mm mesh size) in natural lakes and reservoirs across the continental U.S. using multiple linear regressions and regression tree analyses. We found that large-bodied crustacean zooplankton density was overall higher in natural lakes compared to reservoirs when the effect of latitude was controlled. The difference between waterbody types was driven by calanoid copepods, which were also more likely to be dominant in the {\textgreater}0.243 mm zooplankton community in natural lakes than in reservoirs. Regression tree analyses revealed that water residence time was not a major driver of calanoid copepod density in natural lakes but was one of the most important drivers of calanoid copepod density in reservoirs, which had on average 0.5-year shorter water residence times than natural lakes. Reservoirs managed for purposes that resulted in shorter residence times (e.g., hydroelectric power) had lower zooplankton densities than reservoirs managed for purposes that resulted in longer residence times (e.g., irrigation). Consequently, our results indicate that water residence time may be an important characteristic driving differing large-bodied zooplankton dynamics between reservoirs and natural lakes.},

	abstract = {The Pannonian Basin, a major back-arc basin in the Alpine–Carpathian orogenic belt, experienced its syn-rift phase during the Early–Middle Miocene. Studying coeval sediments can provide important information on the initiation of the extension. This paper investigates syn-rift deposits in the Mecsek Mts. in SW Hungary from a tectono-sedimentary aspect, using stratigraphy, palaeontology and structural observations to constrain palaeoenvironments and their tectonic background. Our study shows that in the Mecsek area the widespread Early Miocene fluvial sedimentation was not directly followed by inundation by the Central Paratethys sea, instead, a phase of lacustrine deposition in the Karpatian–Early Badenian (late Burdigalian–early Langhian) preceded the marine flooding. The lake sediments have a low-diversity but abundant, endemic mollusc and ostracod fauna, dominated by the bivalve Congeria boeckhi and the gastropod Ferebithynia vadászi. Identical faunas at various sites indicate that “Lake Mecsek” was a single water body, covering the present-day Mecsek Mts. and their surroundings. Wedge-shaped clastic bodies along faults, fault scarp breccias and semi-soft sediment deformations suggest that extensional tectonic activity related to the rifting of the Pannonian Basin played a role in lake basin formation. The accumulation of lakes was probably also enhanced by increased precipitation during the Miocene Climatic Optimum. The Central Paratethys flooded the area in the Badenian (Langhian) and deposited normal marine sediments over the lacustrine ones. Considering the fauna, the sedimentary succession, the structural background and evolution history, the Mecsek area seems to be part of the Illyrian bioprovince and related to the Dinaride Lake System.},

The paper presents analysis of both the visual content and written text of two brochures summarising two central EU biodiversity policy documents. The study illustrates how the two modes of communication differ. First, the written text primarily presents an anthropocentric and economic framing of biodiversity values, whereas the visual material generally features the beauty and wonders of nature. Second, the written text strongly emphasises the threats to biodiversity and the detrimental side of human activity, whereas the visual material generally shows close relationships between humans and nature, with humans engaged in small-scale outdoor activities. The analysis illustrates how various representations of biodiversity intersect in the same context, and that the visual representation decontextualises the issue of biodiversity loss from the human exploitation of natural resources and the concrete actions and processes causing it.},

This is, among other processes, attributed to the stimulation or inhibition of settlement by resident species. In an experimental study, we evaluated the effects of different densities of the ascidian Diplosoma listerianum on the settlement of the hydrozoan Obelia sp. For this, we monitored the cover of the dominant fouler Obelia sp. on vertically orientated PVC tiles, which were either bare or pre-seeded with two different densities (sparse or dense) of Diplosoma colonies, over the course of 8 weeks. The settlement tiles were deployed at two study sites in La Herradura Bay, Chile. The presence of D. listerianum enhanced the settlement or the growth or both of the colonial hydrozoan, but this effect disappeared within 4–8 weeks. Furthermore, we tested whether the initial enhancement of Obelia sp. by Diplosoma colonies goes back to the fact that larvae, which reject the ascidian tunic as a settlement substratum after a first contact, colonize nearby surfaces because of their limited mobility. However, we found no support for this assumption. We rather suggest that D. listerianum facilitated colonization indirectly by the accumulation of organic material in its vicinity and/or by its pumping activity. Initial resident-mediated enhancement of the hydrozoan was overridden by processes such as competition between later colonizers within the course of weeks and we could not detect any lasting effects of D. listerianum on the structure of the developing communities.},

	abstract = {The world is currently experiencing a sixth period of mass species extinction, and extinction of flora and fauna is caused by a variety of factors arising from industrial activity and increasing human population, such as global warming, climate change, habitat loss, pollution and use of pesticides. Most causes of extinction are linked to corporate activity, either directly or indirectly. Around the World in 80 Species: Exploring the Business of Extinction responds to the ongoing mass extinction crisis engulfing our planet by exploring the ways in which accounting, business and finance can be used to prevent species extinctions. From Africa to the Far East and from Europe to the Americas, the authors explore species loss and how businesses can stop mass extinctions through greater transparency, and through closer engagement with their investors and wildlife organisations. The book concludes that global capitalism has led us to this extinction crisis and that therefore the mechanisms of capitalism - namely accounting, finance, investment - can help to pull us out. Businesses must urgently address extinction before it is too late for all species, including ourselves. As the first book to explore corporate accounting and accountability in relation to species on the brink of extinction, this book will be of great interest to both professionals and a wider audience interested in the causes and prevention of extinction.},

Newsweek. For many years he specialized in coverage of domestic terrorism and other conflicts, including the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City and the Branch Davidian standoff outside Waco, Texas. He has also spent many years writing about the environment, including droughts in the Southwest, hurricanes in the Southeast, wind power on the Great Plains, and the causes and consequences of the "dead zone" in the Gulf of Mexico.

After his time at
Newsweek, Annin became associate director of the Institutes for Journalism and Natural Resources, a nonpartisan national nonprofit that organizes educational fellowships for midcareer environmental journalists. In September 2006 he published his first book,
The Great Lakes Water Wars, which has been called the definitive work on the Great Lakes water diversion controversy, and received the Great Lakes Book Award for nonfiction. From 2010 to 2015 Annin served as managing director of the University of Notre Dame's Environmental Change Initiative, which targets the interrelated problems of invasive species, land use, and climate change, focusing on their synergistic impacts on water resources.
He currently serves as director of the Mary Griggs Burke Center for Freshwater Innovation at Northland College in Ashland, Wisconsin. He has a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Wisconsin and a master's in international affairs from Columbia University in New York.},

It is an important ecosystem engineer and, due to its ecological value, is protected by international convention. The aim of this study is to investigate the mollusc composition and diversity occurring within Spanish vermetid bioconstructions. During the late summer 2013, three distant sites along the Mediterranean coast of Spain were sampled by scraping off the vermetid shells to study their associated assemblages. A total of 600 molluscs were identified within the classes of Polyplacophora (four species), Gastropoda (35 spp.) and Bivalvia (18 spp.). Multivariate analyses revealed significant differences in composition and trophic diversity of mollusc assemblages among the three sites, highlighting a clear geographical gradient. Overall, both herbivores (grazers and deposit feeders) and omnivores were the quantitatively dominant trophic groups, while carnivores (predators and ectoparasites) were very scarce. Our results point out that mollusc assemblages associated with vermetid bioconstructions are rich and diversified, both in populations structure and trophic diversity, confirming the important role of vermetid gastropods as ecosystem engineers and biodiversity enhancers in shallow coastal waters.},

The age of each fish was estimated using thin-sectioned otoliths, and total length (TL) and weight were determined for each fish. When adjusted for the effect of age, males were found to be 7\% higher in Hg concentration than females. Nearly all (about 98\%) of the Hg found in the white suckers was determined to be methylmercury. In an earlier study on the same 51 white suckers from the Kewaunee River spawning run, males were found to be 18\% higher than females in polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentration. We determined that the ratio of Hg concentration to PCB concentration in females was significantly higher than that in males. Thus, sex significantly interacted with contaminant type (Hg or PCBs) in determining contaminant concentrations. The most plausible explanation for this interaction was that males eliminated Hg at a faster rate than females, most likely due to the boosting of the Hg-elimination rate by certain androgens such as testosterone and 11-ketotestosterone. Hg concentrations in the white suckers were well below federal guidelines for fish consumption.},

	abstract = {Over the last 22 years significant phytoplankton changes in Hongfeng lake reservoir have been observed with multiple years of harmful cyanobacteria blooms (cHABs). Fish farming and other anthropogenic activities from 1994-2001 triggered the harmful blooms. Nine years after the cessation of aquaculture, a conversion from problematic species (Microcystis spp, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae) to the less problematic species P. limnetica and other associated non-cyanobacteria taxa was recorded. Through this period of change, trophic factors (bottom-up) were re-examined, and correlations between cHABs and selected environmental variables were observed. Higher temperatures, nutrients (TN, TP) and available light significantly favored the development of Microcystis spp blooms. With declining nutrient loads, and a decline in TP relative to TN there was a competitive shift from Microcystis summer blooms to the growth of Pseudanabaena limnetica and other non-cyanobacteria. Pseudanabaena limnetica was favored over Microcystis spp when temperatures were {\textless}20°C and TP was {\textless}0.03 mg L-1. The apparent species succession to P. limnetica was enhanced by a competitive advantage under varied light conditions. Multiple environmental and biotic conditions (not always nutrients) were driving cHABs. Although only a selected number of environmental variables were examined, the CCA analysis supports observations that temperature and nutrients were associated with the species shift. The replacement of cHABs with the growth of less toxic cyanobacteria like P. limnetica, and other algae creates an interesting scenario (new community condition) for the removal of problematic taxa in reservoir systems. Diverting or controlling blooms will have direct implications on water quality and economic remediation initiatives in reservoir and lake management.},

	abstract = {Background:Elderly drivers are an increasing group in society. Previous research has found that functional and cognitive abilities are more important for driving abilities than biological age. In an attempt to conserve independent mobility for elderly drivers, many researchers have focused on elderly drivers diagnosed with cognitive decline (mild cognitive impairment or mild Dementia). This study is the first to focus on elderly drivers with cognitive complaints or suspected of diminished fitness to drive by an (in)formal caregiver as an at-risk group.Methods:The main objective of this study was to develop a fitness to drive screening tool for elderly drivers to be used in a doctor's office. Furthermore, this study investigated the additional value of driving simulator tests in the assessment of fitness to drive. Both screenings (functional abilities and driving simulator test) were benchmarked against the official Belgian fitness to drive licensing procedure.Results:One-hundred thirty-six elderly drivers participated in a functional abilities screening, a driving simulator assessment and an on-road driving test. Sixty-five percent of the sample was considered fit to drive. Visual acuity, physical flexibility, and knowledge of road signs were found to be the best predictive set of tests for the on-road fitness to drive outcome. A performance based driving simulator assessment increased predictive accuracy significantly.Conclusion:The proposed screening procedure saves part of the at-risk elderly driver population from stressful and costly on-road driving evaluations. This procedure provides more information of an individual driver's specific driving parameters. This opens doors for personalized older driver training to maintain independent mobility in later life.},

	abstract = {Biomineralization is the complex process by organisms produce protective and supportive structures. Employed by mollusks, biomineralization enables creation of external shells for protection against environmental stressors. The shell deposition mechanism is initiated in the early stages of development and is dependent upon the concentration and availability of calcium carbonate ions. Changes in concentrations of the critical ions required for shell formation can result in malformation of shells. As pCO2 concentrations in the atmosphere continue to increase, the oceans are becoming more acidified. This process, known as ocean acidification (OA), has demonstrated adverse effects on shell formation in calcifying organisms across taxa. Although OA is known to inhibit the shell deposition in mollusks, the impact of OA on the gene regulation of calcium deposition remains unknown. Here we show the responses of four calcium-binding protein genes, caltractin (cetn), calmodulin (calm), calreticulin (calr), and calnexin (canx), to CO2-derived OA using a Crassostrea virginica mantle cell (CvMC) culture model and a larval C. virginica model. These four genes were cloned from C. virginica and the three-dimensional structures of the proteins encoded by these four genes were fully characterized using homologue modeling methods. Although an acidified environment by increased atmospheric pCO2 (1000 ppm) did not result in significant effects on CvMC proliferation and apoptosis, lower environmental pH induced upregulations of all four calcium-binding protein genes in CvMCs. Similarly, increased pCO2 did not affect the growth of larval C. virginica in the early stages of development. However, elevated pCO2 concentrations enhanced the expression of these calcium-binding protein genes at the protein level. The four calcium-binding protein genes demonstrated responsive expression profiles to an acidified environment at both cellular and individual levels. Further investigation of these genes may provide insight into the molecular regulation of mollusk biomineralization under OA stress.},

Today’s collagen grafts mostly are made of decellularized and otherwise processed animal tissue and therefore carry the risk of unwanted side effects and limited mechanical strength, which makes them unsuitable for some applications e.g., within tissue engineering. In order to improve collagen-based biomaterials, recent advances have been made to process soluble collagen through nature-inspired silk-like spinning processes and to overcome the difficulties in providing adequate amounts of source material by manufacturing collagen-like proteins through biotechnological methods and peptide synthesis. Since these methods also open up possibilities to incorporate additional functional domains into the collagen, we discuss one of the best-performing collagen-like type of proteins, which already have additional functional domains in the natural blueprint, the marine mussel byssus collagens, providing inspiration for novel biomaterials based on collagen-silk hybrid proteins.},

The sediment samples from the estuary tributary sites significantly impacted reproduction in Quinquelaophonte sp. However, results from one of the estuary sites were not significantly different to those from the tributaries sites, suggesting that chemicals other than trace metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and ammonia may be the causative stressors. Sediment elutriate samples had significant effects on reproductive endpoints in G. pectinatus, and on the induction of DNA damage in cells, as shown by the comet assay. The results indicate that sediment contamination at the Ahuriri Estuary has the potential to impact biological processes of benthic and pelagic organisms.

It is still under discussion if microplastics are relevant pollutant vectors for uptake into aquatic organisms in comparison to further uptake pathways, e.g., via water or sediment particles. We analyzed how the presence of microplastics (polyamide particles, PA) modifies acute effects of the environmental pollutant bisphenol A (BPA) on freshwater zooplankton (Daphnia magna). Daphnids were exposed to PA particles and BPA alone, before combining them in the next step with one concentration of PA and varying concentrations of BPA. The PA particles themselves did not induce negative effects, while the effects of BPA alone followed a typical dose-dependent manner. Sorption of BPA to PA particles prior to exposure led to a reduction of BPA in the aqueous phase. The combination of BPA and PA led to decreased immobilization, although PA particles loaded with BPA were ingested by the daphnids. Calculations based on physiochemistry and equilibrium assumptions indicated lower BPA body burden of daphnids in the presence of PA particles. These results confirm model-based studies, and show that investigated microplastic concentrations are negligible for the overall pollutant uptake of daphnids with water as additional uptake pathway.},

We also compared cyanotoxin concentrations among the resident individuals of Curonian Lagoon and the migratory individuals in or returning from the Baltic Sea. No difference in toxin levels was observed among the resident and migratory pikeperch, although toxin concentrations were frequently close to or exceeded the recommended concentrations for safe long-term human consumption.},

	abstract = {Current numerical methods for simulating biophysical processes in aquatic environments are typically constructed in a grid-based Eulerian framework or as an individual-based model in a particle-based Lagrangian framework. Often, the biogeochemical processes and physical (hydrodynamic) processes occur at different time and space scales, and changes in biological processes do not affect the hydrodynamic conditions. Therefore, it is possible to develop an alternative strategy to grid-based approaches for linking hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models that can significantly improve computational efficiency for this type of linked biophysical model. In this work, we utilize a new technique that links hydrodynamic effects and biological processes through a property-carrying particle model (PCPM) in a Lagrangian/Eulerian framework. The model is tested in idealized cases and its utility is demonstrated in a practical application to Sandusky Bay. Results show the integration of Lagrangian and Eulerian approaches allows for a natural coupling of mass transport (represented by particle movements and random walk) and biological processes in water columns which is described by a nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton-detritus (NPZD) biological model. This method is far more efficient than traditional tracer-based Eulerian biophysical models for 3-D simulation, particularly for a large domain and/or ensemble simulations.},

One of the most interesting solution is to use water reservoirs, rivers and sea areas. The extension of buildings affects the building materials, especially hydrotechnical concrete. Water structures are usually the objects of huge dimensions exposed to extreme conditions. In most cases these buildings are specific and complicated. They require an individual approach to concrete mix design and should be monitored by measurement technologies supported by automated numerical examinations. Nowadays health monitoring systems are applied to large variety of engineering structures. In order to get the required quality of hydrotechnical concrete, additives and admixtures are necessary. The material properties of underwater concrete can be also improved using polymer and steel fibers of various content and length. The majority of areas are built of concrete, that is the reason to be aware of admixture influence on the environment and living organisms. The attempt to evaluate the description of different kinds of hydrotechnical concrete as potential habitat of water organisms, was indicated in the paper.},

	abstract = {Aquatic environmental pollution due to negative human activities remains a major problem. Bioindicators that primarily describe the total concentration of the respective pollutant are very useful tools to aid in the chemical analysis of water in order to obtain knowledge about the levels of pollutants in the environment. This study therefore used Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy (ESR) to detect the presence of transition metals (copper, iron and manganese) and possible radicals present in samples of Neoechinorhynchus curemai and its host tissues Prochilodus lineatus, as well in water and sediment of the Batalha River, at the same sample site where fish were collected. Spectral analysis of samples showed the presence of three metals (Cu2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+), in addition to nitric oxide (NO) and humic acid (HA). Quantification of the elements in the samples was possible only for Cu detected in the spectrum of parasites, which was equivalent to 2 ppm. ESR proved to be efficient in the detection of transition-metal ions (Cu2+, Fe3+ and Mn2+), in addition to NO and HA. However, the low concentration values of these compounds in P. lineatus tissues (liver, muscle and intestine) and in the water and sediment samples collected did not allow their quantification, as they were below the limit of detection. It can be concluded that N. curemai had the capacity to accumulate these ions, especially copper.Alternate abstract:A poluição de ambientes aquáticos em decorrência de atividades antrópicas negativas permanece sendo um grande problema.

Nesse contexto, o objetivo desse trabalho foi o de empregar a técnica de Espectroscopia de Ressonância do Spin Eletrônico (ESR) para detectar a presença de poluentes, diretamente em espécimes de Neoechinorhynchus curemai e nos tecidos do seu hospedeiro Prochilodus lineatus, assim também como na água e sedimento do rio Batalha, no mesmo ponto onde os peixes foram coletados. A análise do espectro das amostras identificou a presença de três metais (Cu2+, Fe3+ e Mn2+), além do óxido nítrico (NO) e do ácido húmico (AH).

Considering the need for indirect reuse of wastewater for public supply, this work aimed to investigate FD water sources regarding the presence and risks of three contaminants of emerging concern: caffeine, carbamazepine, and atrazine. Samples from two current water sources (Descoberto and Santa-Maria Lakes) and two future water sources of the FD (Paranoá and Corumbá Lakes) were analyzed by solid-phase extraction followed by liquid chromatography coupled to hybrid quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF/MS). Method precision and accuracy were satisfactory and limits of quantification ranged from 0.37 to 0.54 ng/L. Higher concentrations were observed for caffeine in the future water sources (39 to 180 ng/L) followed by carbamazepine (5.4 to 25 ng/L) and atrazine (3.9 to 15 ng/L). The less-impacted water sources, in current use in the FD, present caffeine concentrations ranging from 4.8 to 32 ng/L and atrazine levels varying between 2.4 and 5.5 ng/L. Carbamazepine was not detected in these reservoirs. Environmental risk assessment indicates a possible risk for carbamazepine and atrazine, evidencing the need for further studies. No human health risk was depicted within the results.},

	abstract = {Consumption of raw oysters is known to cause serious health conditions due to bioaccumulation of contaminants. As filter feeders, oysters ingest bacteria along with phytoplankton from their surrounding habitats. Ensuring seafood safety for human consumption is always a concern. Since oysters are consumed raw, disease causing organisms, environmental contaminants, toxins, chemicals, and even physical hazards such as soils and metals retained in the oysters can enter through feeding. The objective of this study was to determine the quality of oysters collected from Delaware Inland Bays (DIB) and compare them with market oysters. Environmental parameters were monitored from local waters of DIB classified as closed versus open for shellfish harvesting. Total aerobic bacteria and vibrio were higher in market oysters during the warmer months, with open water having the least microbial loads. There were no significant differences in total vibrio counts between the study sites (p=0.396), but significant differences were recorded over time (p=0.004). Water temperature and turbidity were directly proportional to total vibrio in oysters, and salinity was inversely related. Research findings in this study may help bring awareness of changes in bacterial loads due to seasonal changes and additional handling and storage.},

Acquisition of additional genetic knowledge concerning the present R. decussatus populations is essential to address adequate conservation plans for this species. For this purpose, we analysed a portion of the mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) region in populations from the western Mediterranean, where this species represents a harvested fishery resource. Our analyses revealed an overall lack of genetic structure within the western Mediterranean area, and the occurrence of mtDNA substructuring between the Aegean and Marmara seas and the remaining populations from the whole Mediterranean basin and the South European Atlantic coast. The results obtained for populations from Sardinia, where extensive restocking programmes have not been reported and where R. philippinarum is rare and localised, suggest that intensive harvesting and potential dispersal alone may have been able to shape the genetic variation identified in the local R. decussatus populations.},

In the present study, we assessed the impact of one of the most frequently used pesticides in both residential and agricultural applications − the synthetic pyrethroid cypermethrin (CYP) − on developmental neurotoxicity (DNT). Female mice were perinatally exposed to low doses of CYP (5 and 20 mg/kg body weight) from gestation to postnatal day 15. Behavioral analyses were performed during the offspring’s early life and during adulthood. Postnatal analyses revealed that perinatal exposure to CYP disturbed motor development without modifying sensory and communicative skills. We found that later in life, CYP-exposed offspring expressed maladaptive behaviors in response to highly challenging tasks and abnormal sociability. Transcriptomic analyses performed in the offspring’s brain at the end of the exposure, highlighted mitochondrial dysfunction as a relevant pathomechanism underlying CYP-induced DNT. Interestingly, several genes involved in proteostasis maintenance were also shown to be dysregulated suggesting that alterations in biogenesis, folding, trafficking and degradation of proteins may significantly contribute to CYP-related DNT. From a regulatory perspective, this study highlights that behavioral and transcriptomic analyses are complementary tools providing useful direction for better DNT characterization, and as such, should be used together more systematically.},

	abstract = {There is a growing use of remote sensing observations for detecting and quantifying freshwater cyanobacteria populations, yet the inherent optical properties of these communities in natural settings, fundamental to bio-optical algorithms, are not well known. Towards bridging this knowledge gap, we measured a full complement of optical properties in western Lake Erie during cyanobacteria blooms in the summers of 2013 and 2014. Our measurements focus attention on the optical uniqueness of cyanobacteria blooms, which have consequences for remote sensing and bio-optical modeling. We found the cyanobacteria blooms in the western basin during our field work were dominated by Microcystis, while the waters in the adjacent central basin were dominated by Planktothrix. Chlorophyll concentrations ranged from 1 to over 135 \$\{{\textbackslash}mu\}g/L\$ across the study area with the highest concentrations associated with Microcystis in the western basin. We observed large, amorphous colonial Microcystis structures in the bloom area characterized by high phytoplankton absorption and high scattering coefficients with a mean particle backscatter ratio at 443nm greater than 0.03, which is higher than other plankton types and more comparable to suspended inorganic sediments. While our samples contained mixtures of both, our analysis suggests high contributions to the measured scatter and backscatter coefficients from cyanobacteria. Our measurements provide new insights into the optical properties of cyanobacteria blooms, and indicate that current semi-analytic models are likely to have problems resolving a closed solution in these types of waters as many of our observations are beyond the range of existing model components. We believe that different algorithm or model approaches are needed for these conditions, specifically for phytoplankton absorption and particle backscatter components. From a remote sensing perspective, this presents a challenge not only in terms of a need for new algorithms, but also for determining when to apply the best algorithm for a given situation. These results are new in the sense that they represent a complete description of the optical properties of freshwater cyanobacteria blooms, and are likely to be representative of bloom conditions for other systems containing Microcystis cells and colonies.},

	abstract = {This edited volume provides a variety of insights into the context in which ocean and wetlands policy is placed at the sub-continental level. The governments of Mexico, Canada, and the United States of America have recognized the importance of conserving, protecting, and enhancing the environment in their territories. As a result, they have developed an institutional structure aimed at furthering environmental cooperation. However, marine environment has played a secondary role, characterized by scientific cooperation that does not develop into regional policies. This project analyzes how ocean and wetlands preservation is omitted from the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, meaning that collaborative efforts under-perform or remain largely sidelined from mainstream issues. As contributors come from a mix of the social and natural sciences (politics, international relations, law studies, sociology, oceanology, and oceanography), this book presents diverse viewpoints on how to address wetlands protection, deep ocean research collaboration, and the marine context of the Sustainable Development Goals.
Fills a knowledge gap where ocean and marine studies in Mexico, Canada and the United States merge with the global development agenda Provides an interdisciplinary perspective through contributors from all three North American countries and from diverse academic backgrounds: environmental policy, environmental agency, marine conservation, environmental and marine law, marine ecology, biological oceanography, and sociology Promotes collaboration between the social and natural sciences Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras

	abstract = {With the occurrence of recreational and small scale subsistence fishing activities at the Vaal Dam, South Africa, consumption of fish from this dam may result in health risks associated with trace elements and metals. The Vaal Dam is one of the largest dams in South Africa, located between the Gauteng Province and Orange Free State, and supplies water to approximately 11.6 million people. A total of 38 specimens of the benthic cyprinid fish Labeo umbratus were collected from the Vaal Dam during two surveys, in 2011 and 2016. Samples of muscle, liver, kidney, gill and spinal cord were analysed, along with sediment samples collected during the same surveys. Thirteen trace elements were analysed in the samples by Inductively Coupled Plasma–Optical Emission Spectrometry, Inductively Coupled Plasma–Mass Spectrometry, Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy and Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence spectroscopy. This is the first survey on trace element and Hg accumulation in this fish species from the Vaal Dam and target hazard quotients (THQ) indicated that there is a risk for consumers of fish for As and Hg (THQ = 1.43 and 1.14 respectively). Although levels of trace elements in this impoundment have shown little change for a number of years and are lower than global background levels, studies detailing the accumulation of metals by fish inhabiting the Vaal Dam have indicated that trace elements in muscle tissue are above food safety guidelines. Trace element levels in L. umbratus are lower compared to other species inhabiting the Vaal Dam and further indicate that risks for consumers can be decreased if humans relying on fish from the Vaal Dam preferentially consume this species over others.},

Here, we aim to advance the field by comparing uptake and effects of microplastic particles (MPP) of a biodegradable bioMPP (polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)) and petroleum-based MPP (polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)) in the freshwater amphipod Gammarus fossarum. Ingestion of both MPP in different particle sizes (32–250 µm) occurred after 24 h, with highest ingestion of particles in the range 32–63 µm and almost complete egestion after 64 h. A four-week effect-experiment showed a significant decrease of the assimilation efficiency in amphipods exposed to the petroleum-based MPP from week two onwards. The petroleum-based PMMA affected assimilation efficiency significantly in contrast to the biodegradable PHB, but overall differences in direct comparison of MPP types were small. Both MPP types led to a significantly lower wet weight gain relative to the control treatments. After four weeks, differences between both MPP types and silica, used as a natural particle control, were detected. In summary, these results suggest that both MPP types provoke digestive constraints on the amphipods, which go beyond those of natural non-palatable particles. This highlights the need for more detailed research comparing environmental effects of biodegradable and petroleum-based MPP and testing those against naturally occurring particle loads.},

	abstract = {Haemic neoplasia (HN) in bivalves has been reported in association with mass mortality events in various species of molluscs. The aim of this work was to quantify the nuclear morphometry and DNA content of neoplastic cells of mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis affected by HN using nuclear densitometry in Feulgen-stained preparations. The results were also compared with a population of normal mussel haemocytes. We captured 256 images of 3 different neoplasia stages and 120 images of normal haemocytes; thus, a total of 120,166 nuclei were analysed. We extracted 21 morphological parameters from normal and neoplastic nuclei. Eighteen of these parameters were different (P{\textless}0.05). Among those (expressed in pixel units—inter-pixel distance of 0.45 micrometres—as: normal vs. neoplastic) nuclear area (117.1±94.1 vs. 423.1±226.9), perimeter (44.9±14.0 vs. 79.0±21.3) and (IOD) integrated optical density (13.47±34.5 vs. 177.1±150.8) were relevant features to discriminate between normal and neoplastic cells. Those differences allowed identifying two distinctive populations of neoplastic nuclei, occasionally in the same individuals at a given phase of the disease. Moreover, neoplastic haemocytes in less extended lesions showed a ploidy value of 6.2 n along with the presence of a second population of circulating cells with a DNA content of 10.7n. In samples with moderate disease only one peak at 7n was observed. Finally, in more severe conditions, a further ploidy peak of 7.8n was recorded, accompanied by a shallow but broad peak of 31n. This latter extreme value is thought to be due to the presence of giant multinucleated cells where individual nuclei overlap in space and cannot be discerned individually. Computer-based imaging allowed the direct visualization of the cell populations and simultaneous collection of ploidy data as well as morphological features of nuclei.},

	abstract = {The effects of stocking both filter-feeding fish and piscivorous fish were compared to the effects of stocking only filter-feeding fish for suppressing algal blooms and improving water quality in the impoundment area of Xiaojiang River where catfish were dominant. Using only filter-feeding fish for algal suppression and water quality control was more effective in the short-term, but use of both filter-feeding fish and piscivorous fish was better in the long-term. Obvious suppression of phytoplankton biomass (PB) only occurred during the first 14 days regardless of the fish stocked. Adding fish to the enclosure clearly alters phytoplankton community structure and introducing piscivorous fish to an enclosure stocked with filter-feeding fish changed the relative densities of dominant algae species. While stocking filter-feeding fish decreased total nitrogen concentration by removing phytoplankton, it did not effectively decrease total phosphorus and Chlorophyll a concentrations. Introducing piscivorous fish to the enclosure weakened the relationship between nutrients and phytoplankton. Results indicate that stocking only filter-feeding fish to improve water quality and suppress phytoplankton in an impoundment area is insufficient and other technologies and means should be applied simultaneously.},

In this study 13 sulfated polyphenols were synthesized and tested for antifouling potential using the anti-settlement activity of mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) plantigrade post-larvae and bacterial growth inhibition towards four biofilm-forming bacterial strains. Results show that some of these Nature-inspired compounds were bioactive, particularly rutin persulfate (2), 3,6-bis(β-D-glucopyranosyl) xanthone persulfate (6), and gallic acid persulfate (12) against the settlement of plantigrades. The chemical precursors of sulfated compounds 2 and 12 were also tested for anti-settlement activity and it was possible to conclude that bioactivity is associated with sulfation. While compound 12 showed the most promising anti-settlement activity (EC50 = 8.95 μg.mL-1 ), compound 2 also caused the higher level of growth inhibition in bacteria Vibrio harveyi (EC20 = 12.5 μg.mL-1 ). All the three bioactive compounds 2, 6, and 12 were also found to be nontoxic to the non target species Artemia salina ({\textless}10\% mortality at 250 μM) and Vibrio fischeri (LC50 {\textgreater} 1000 μg.mL-1 ). This study put forward the relevance of synthesizing non-natural sulfated small molecules to generate new nontoxic antifouling agents.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12864-017-4012-z},
	abstract = {Background 
Mytilisepta virgata is a marine mussel commonly found along the coasts of Japan. Although this species has been the subject of occasional studies concerning its ecological role, growth and reproduction, it has been so far almost completely neglected from a genetic and molecular point of view. In the present study we present a high quality de novo assembled transcriptome of the Japanese purplish mussel, which represents the first publicly available collection of expressed sequences for this species.
Results
The assembled transcriptome comprises almost 50,000 contigs, with a N50 statistics of {\textasciitilde}1 kilobase and a high estimated completeness based on the rate of BUSCOs identified, standing as one of the most exhaustive sequence resources available for mytiloid bivalves to date. Overall this data, accompanied by gene expression profiles from gills, digestive gland, mantle rim, foot and posterior adductor muscle, presents an accurate snapshot of the great functional specialization of these five tissues in adult mussels.
Conclusions
We highlight that one of the most striking features of the M. virgata transcriptome is the high abundance and diversification of lectin-like transcripts, which pertain to different gene families and appear to be expressed in particular in the digestive gland and in the gills. Therefore, these two tissues might be selected as preferential targets for the isolation of molecules with interesting carbohydrate-binding properties.
In addition, by molecular phylogenomics, we provide solid evidence in support of the classification of M. virgata within the Brachidontinae subfamily. This result is in agreement with the previously proposed hypothesis that the morphological features traditionally used to group Mytilisepta spp. and Septifer spp. within the same clade are inappropriate due to homoplasy.},

	abstract = {A variety of bivalve mollusks (phylum Mollusca, class Bivalvia) constitute a prominent commodity in fisheries and aquacultures, but are also crucial in order to preserve our ecosystem’s complexity and function. Bivalve mollusks, such as clams, mussels, oysters and scallops, are relevant bred species, and their global farming maintains a high incremental annual growth rate, representing a considerable proportion of the overall fishery activities. Bivalve mollusks are filter feeders; therefore by filtering a great quantity of water, they may bioaccumulate in their tissues a high number of microorganisms that can be considered infectious for humans and higher vertebrates. Moreover, since some pathogens are also able to infect bivalve mollusks, they are a threat for the entire mollusk farming industry. In consideration of the leading role in aquaculture and the growing financial importance of bivalve farming, much interest has been recently devoted to investigate the pathogenesis of infectious diseases of these mollusks in order to be prepared for public health emergencies and to avoid dreadful income losses. Several bacterial and viral pathogens will be described herein. Despite the minor complexity of the organization of the immune system of bivalves, compared to mammalian immune systems, a precise description of the different mechanisms that induce its activation and functioning is still missing. In the present review, a substantial consideration will be devoted in outlining the immune responses of bivalves and their repertoire of immune cells. Finally, we will focus on the description of antimicrobial peptides that have been identified and characterized in bivalve mollusks. Their structural and antimicrobial features are also of great interest for the biotechnology sector as antimicrobial templates to combat the increasing antibiotic-resistance of different pathogenic bacteria that plague the human population all over the world.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this experiment was to study the effects of ZnO nanoparticles(nps) on the development of Thyroid gland in  Xenopus laevis tadpoles throughout the metamorphosis process. To accomplish this, X. laevis tadpoles were exposed to an aqueous suspension of 110–150nm ZnO NPs beginning in-ovo and continuing through metamorphosis up to NF stage 57. The nanomaterials were dispersed through sonication in FETAX salt solution and a static-renewal method was used to replenish the loss of ZnO NPs by precipitation ZnO NPs . All the animals exposed to 0.125 and 0.250 mg/L had the same developmental rate as control, and so were all the other parameters like mortality, follicular area, and hyperplasia. Animals exposed to 0.25 mg/l had moderate levels of hyperplasia (score of 1.4) whereas animals in 0.125 mg/l and control had mild to no hyperplasia respectively. Exposure to 0.5 mg/L and higher ZnO NPs lead to significantly higher mortality, with 2 mg/L inducing a mortality rate of 60\%. These concentrations also had significantly smaller average body mass, the rate of the metamorphosis of tadpoles and the thyroid gland development in the exposed tadpoles. The average follicular area for these tadpoles was smaller than controls, and the follicular area of animals in control increased by 90\% of the area of animals in 2 mg/L at the end of the study period.  The transformation of simple cuboidal epithelium in follicle walls of control to tall columnar cells in 0.5mg/L and higher concentrations indicate some degree of hypertrophy. No tadpoles exposed to concertation above 0.500mg/L reached stage 57, and the average stage for the animals in 2mg/l was 47, indicating that higher doses have a detrimental effect on thyroid gland development in Xenopus laevis.},

However, conventional approaches (i.e., ground survey and aerial survey) have intrinsic constraints. Advances in image data capture and processing provide new opportunities for using applied remote sensing to count animals. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using very high resolution multispectral satellite images for animal detection, but to date, the practicality of detecting animals from space using panchromatic imagery has not been proven. This study demonstrates that it is possible to detect and count large mammals (e.g., wildebeests and zebras) from a single, very high resolution GeoEye-1 panchromatic image in open savanna. A novel semi-supervised object-based method that combines a wavelet algorithm and a fuzzy neural network was developed. To discern large mammals from their surroundings and discriminate between animals and non-targets, we used the wavelet technique to highlight potential objects. To make full use of geometric attributes, we carefully trained the classifier, using the adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system. Our proposed method (with an accuracy index of 0.79) significantly outperformed the traditional threshold-based method (with an accuracy index of 0.58) detecting large mammals in open savanna.},

	abstract = {This dissertation is a study of petroleum performances. It is a creative, performative, and speculative analysis of industrial petroleum operations, rhetorics about petroleum, and everyday North American life capacitated by petroleum products. North American petroleum operations and relations are examined through comparison and substitution with indigenous legal thought. This dissertation, in two parts, focuses on two technical operations of the petroleum industry, a refinery and a pipeline hub.    Part One: Refining Petroleum Performances is about petroleum performances analyzed and speculated through the refining processes of the BP Cherry Point Refinery located at Xwe'chi'eXen. These chapters explore petroleum performances through analogy, parable and allegory figured by thinking with indigenous jurisprudence and ecological figuration. The analysis and speculations are arranged around a technical description of refinery processes from incoming crude to finished fuels. Nested and nestled within the refinery performance, its form analogizes to refine a taxonomy of petroleum performances; combustion, petroleum relations, motive power, works and rhetoric about petroleum, petroleum infrastructure and backgrounds, petroleum jurisprudence, and petroleum allegories. The technical description diagrams a parable of petroleum performance saturated with examples from art, industry, and the everyday.    Part two of Petroleum Performances, Pipelining Spacetime, examines how pipelines perform petroleum spacetime. It demonstrates how petroleum and petroleum rhetoric perform and reinforce grand narratives and teleological futures. This petroleum space/time continuum is contrasted with periodic and place-based temporalities of some indigenous jurisdictions. Pipeline Spacetime investigates Patoka terminal, a place full of pipelines through experiences of times and places that refuses pipelines.},

	abstract = {Background 
Mass occurrences of cyanobacteria frequently cause detrimental effects to the functioning of aquatic ecosystems. Consequently, attempts haven been made to control cyanobacterial blooms through naturally co-occurring herbivores. Control of cyanobacteria through herbivores often appears to be constrained by their low dietary quality, rather than by the possession of toxins, as also non-toxic cyanobacteria are hardly consumed by many herbivores. It was thus hypothesized that the consumption of non-toxic cyanobacteria may be improved when complemented with other high quality prey. We conducted a laboratory experiment in which we fed the herbivorous freshwater gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis single non-toxic cyanobacterial and unialgal diets or a mixed diet to test if diet-mixing may enable these herbivores to control non-toxic cyanobacterial mass abundances.
Results
The treatments where L. stagnalis were fed non-toxic cyanobacteria and a mixed diet provided a significantly higher shell and soft-body growth rate than the average of all single algal, but not the non-toxic cyanobacterial diets. However, the increase in growth provided by the non-toxic cyanobacteria diets could not be related to typical determinants of dietary quality such as toxicity, nutrient stoichiometry or essential fatty acid content.
Conclusions
These results strongly contradict previous research which describes non-toxic cyanobacteria as a low quality food resource for freshwater herbivores in general. Our findings thus have strong implications to gastropod-cyanobacteria relationships and suggest that freshwater gastropods may be able to control mass occurrences of benthic non-toxic cyanobacteria, frequently observed in eutrophied water bodies worldwide.},

We assess whether omnivorous fish readily shift to herbivory or whether animal prey is typically preferred. We address temperature as the key factor causing their absence at higher latitudes and discuss the potential poleward dispersion caused by climate changes. A controlled experiment illustrates that rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) readily utilize plant matter at water temperatures above 20 °C and avoid its consumption below 20 °C. Field data support these results, showing that plant matter dominates rudd diets during the summer and is absent during the spring. Utilizing cellulose requires the enzyme cellulase, which is produced by microorganisms growing at temperatures of 15-42 °C. Water temperatures at higher latitudes do not reach 15 °C year-round; at our latitude of 50°N{\textasciitilde}150 days/year. Hence, the species richness of omnivorous fish decreases dramatically above 55° latitude. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that strict herbivorous specialists have developed only in the tropics. Temperatures below 15 °C, even for a short time period, inactivate cellulase and cause diet limitations for omnivorous fish. However, we may expect increases in herbivory at higher latitudes caused by climate change.},

Shifts in benthic community composition to higher soft coral abundances have been reported for many degraded reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific. However, it is not clear to what extent soft coral abundance and physiology are influenced by water quality. In this study, live benthic cover and water quality (i.e. dissolved inorganic nutrients (DIN), turbidity (NTU), and sedimentation) were assessed at three sites ({\textless} 20 km north of Jakarta) in Jakarta Bay (JB) and five sites along the outer Thousand Islands (20–60 km north of Jakarta). This was supplemented by measurements of photosynthetic yield and, for the first time, respiratory electron transport system (ETS) activity of two dominant soft coral genera, Sarcophyton spp. and Nephthea spp. Findings revealed highly eutrophic water conditions in JB compared to the outer Thousand Islands, with 44\% higher DIN load (7.65 μM/L), 67\% higher NTU (1.49 NTU) and 47\% higher sedimentation rate (30.4 g m−2 d−1). Soft corals were the dominant type of coral cover within the bay (2.4\% hard and 12.8\% soft coral cover) compared to the outer Thousand Islands (28.3\% hard and 6.9\% soft coral cover). Soft coral abundances, photosynthetic yield, and ETS activity were highly correlated with key water quality parameters, particularly DIN and sedimentation rates. The findings suggest water quality controls the relative abundance and physiology of dominant soft corals in JB and may thus contribute to phase shifts from hard to soft coral dominance, highlighting the need to better manage water quality in order to prevent or reverse phase shifts.},

It can have positive or negative effects on humans and animals, though it is more commonly detrimental. Animal research on the topic has been conducted for many years and is capable of suggesting good bioindicators for environmental fluoride pollution. The aim of this study was to investigate the concentration of the fluoride ion in various tissues of invertebrates and vertebrates, including fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, small mammals, ungulates, and predators.

	abstract = {A variety of wildlife species maintained in captivity are susceptible to iron storage disease (ISD), or hemochromatosis, a disease resulting from the deposition of excess iron into insoluble iron clusters in soft tissue. Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) is one of the rhinoceros species that has evolutionarily adapted to a low-iron diet and is susceptible to iron overload. Hemosiderosis is reported at necropsy in many African black and Sumatran rhinoceroses but only a small number of animals reportedly die from hemochromatosis. The underlying cause and reasons for differences in susceptibility to hemochromatosis within the taxon remains unclear. Although serum ferritin concentrations have been useful in monitoring the progression of ISD in many species, there is some question regarding their value in diagnosing hemochromatosis in the Sumatran rhino. To investigate the metabolic changes during the development of hemochromatosis and possibly increase our understanding of its progression and individual susceptibility differences, the serum metabolome from a Sumatran rhinoceros was investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics. The study involved samples from female rhinoceros at the Cincinnati Zoo (n = 3), including two animals that died from liver failure caused by ISD, and the Sungai Dusun Rhinoceros Conservation Centre in Peninsular Malaysia (n = 4). Principal component analysis was performed to visually and statistically compare the metabolic profiles of the healthy animals. The results indicated that significant differences were present between the animals at the zoo and the animals in the conservation center. A comparison of the 43 serum metabolomes of three zoo rhinoceros showed two distinct groupings, healthy (n = 30) and unhealthy (n = 13). A total of eighteen altered metabolites were identified in healthy versus unhealthy samples. Results strongly suggest that NMR-based metabolomics is a valuable tool for animal health monitoring and may provide insight into the progression of this and other insidious diseases.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen stable isotopes (δ2H) have recently been used to complement δ13C and δ15N in food web studies due to their potentially greater power to separate sources of organic matter in aquatic food webs. However, uncertainties remain regarding the use of δ2H, since little is known about the potential variation in the amount of exchangeable hydrogen (Hex) among common sample materials or the patterns of δ2H when entire food webs are considered. We assessed differences in Hex among the typical sample materials in freshwater studies and used δ2H, δ13C and δ15N to compare their effectiveness in tracing allochthonous matter in food webs of two small temperate lakes. Our results showed higher average amounts of Hex in animal tissues (27\% in fish and macroinvertebrates, 19\% in zooplankton) compared to most plant material (15\% in terrestrial plants and 8\% in seston/periphyton), with the exception of aquatic vascular plants (23\%, referred to as macrophytes). The amount of Hex correlated strongly with sample lipid content (inferred from C:N ratios) in fish and zooplankton samples. Overall, the three isotopes provided good separation of sources (seston, periphyton, macrophytes and allochthonous organic matter), particularly the δ2H followed by δ13C. Aquatic macrophytes revealed unexpectedly high δ2H values, having more elevated δ2H values than terrestrial organic matter with direct implications for estimating consumer allochthony. Organic matter from macrophytes significantly contributed to the food webs in both lakes highlighting the need to include macrophytes as a potential source when using stable isotopes to estimate trophic structures and contributions from allochthonous sources.},

	doi = {10.2903/j.efsa.2016.4362},
	abstract = {The present opinion deals with the re‐evaluation of the safety of gold (E 175) when used as a food additive. Gold (E 175) was previously evaluated by the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) in 1975. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has not reviewed gold due to lack of data. None of the Committees established an acceptable daily intake (ADI). The Panel noted the limited data on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of elemental gold and the absence of toxicological data on gold used as a food additive (E 175) and considered the data to be too limited to perform a risk assessment for E 175. Elemental gold has a very low solubility and thus the systemic availability and effects are expected to be low. In contact with tissues ionic gold can be released from elemental gold and a high local concentration of gold can be reached at the site of contact. The Panel noted that no data on subchronic, chronic toxicity and genotoxicity of elemental gold were available. The Panel concluded that, despite the absence of toxicity data, but taking into account the low solubility of elemental gold, systemic availability and thus systemic effects of elemental gold would not be expected. The Panel recommended that the specifications for gold (E 175) should include the mean particle size and particle size distribution (± SD), as well as the percentage (in number) of particles in the nanoscale (with at least one dimension below 100 nm), present in the powder form of gold (E 175). The methodology applied should comply with the EFSA Guidance document. Exposure estimates of gold (E 175) reached up to 1.32 μg/kg body weight (bw)/day in the maximum level exposure assessment scenario and up to 0.33 μg/kg bw/day in the refined, non‐brand‐loyal, exposure scenario.},

	abstract = {Submerged macrophytes are subjected to potential mechanical stresses associated with fluctuating water levels in natural conditions. However, few experimental studies have been conducted to further understand the effects of water level fluctuating amplitude on submerged macrophyte species and their assemblages or communities. We designed a controlled experiment to investigate the responses of three submerged macrophyte species (Hydrilla verticillata, Ceratophyllum demersum and Elodea nuttallii) and their combinations in communities to three amplitudes (static, ± 30 cm, ± 60 cm) of water level fluctuations. Results showed that water level fluctuating amplitude had little effects on the community performance and the three tested species responded differently. H. verticillata exhibited more growth in static water and it was negatively affected by either of the water level fluctuations amplitude, however, growth parameters of H. verticillata in two fluctuating water level treatments (i.e., ± 30 cm, ± 60 cm) were not significantly different. On the other hand, the growth of C. demersum was not significantly correlated with different amplitude treatments. However, it became more abundant when water levels fluctuated. E. nuttallii was inhibited by the two fluctuating water level treatments, and was less in growth parameters compared to the other species especially in water level fluctuating conditions. The inherent differences in the adaptive capabilities of the tested species indicate that C. demersum or other species with similar responses may be dominant species to restore submerged macrophyte communities with great fluctuating water levels. Otherwise, H. verticillata, E. nuttallii or other species with similar responses could be considered for constructing the community in static water conditions.},

This is an absolute prerequisite when wild donor populations are scarce and small. Here, we forecast the population trend of the largest European population of the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) over the next 30 years under different demographic and management scenarios (removal of eggs, chicks or fledglings). Projections derived from the combination of a PDP model (Population Dynamic P-system) and a Box-Behnken design would lead to a decline in 77\% of all 57 scenarios analysed. Among the 13 scenarios predicting a population increase, only 4 seem realistic in terms of growth rate (0.04\%-1.01\%), at least if current age at first breeding and productivity would remain constant over time. Our simulations thus suggest that most extraction scenarios would have detrimental effects on the demography of the donor population. Release of captive-born young or removal of only the second hatched chick for subsequent captive rearing and translocation into the wild appear to represent much better supplementation and reintroduction options in this threatened species.},

The monoamines serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline represent possible endocrine and neuronal links between these signals allowing the molluscs to modulate reproductive functions in conjunction with environmental constraints. Here, we report a disruption of the reproductive cycle of mussels collected from two of three sites along the Moroccan atlantic coast soiled by industrial or domestic waste. Using high pressure liquid chromatography, we show that the temporal pattern of monoamine content in the gonads, pedal and cerebroid ganglia varied throughout the reproductive cycle (resting, developing, maturing, egg-laying) of mussels from the unpolluted site. Marked modification of monoamine tissue content was found between sites, notably in noradrenaline content of the gonads. Discriminant statistics revealed a specific impact of mussel location on the temporal variations of noradrenaline and serotonin levels in gonads and cerebroid ganglia. Correlation analyses showed profound and temporal changes in the monoamine content between organs and ganglia, at the two sites where the reproduction was disrupted. We suggest that environmental constraints lead to profound changes of monoaminergic systems, which thereby compromises the entry of mussels into their reproductive cycle.},

Social Predation: How Group Living Benefits Predators and Prey) by developing several other themes including the development and mechanisms underlying vigilance, as well as developing more fully the evolution and function of vigilance.
Animal vigilance has been at the forefront of research on animal behavior for many years, but no comprehensive review of this topic has existed. Students of animal behavior have focused on many aspects of animal vigilance, from models of its adaptive value to empirical research in the laboratory and in the field. The vast literature on vigilance is widely dispersed with often little contact between models and empirical work and between researchers focusing on different taxa such as birds and mammals.
Animal Vigilance fills this gap in the available material.

Tackles vigilance from all angles, theoretical and empirical, while including the broadest range of species to underscore unifying themes
Discusses several newer developments in the area, such as vigilance copying and effect of food density
Highlights recent challenges to assumptions of traditional models of vigilance, such as the assumption that vigilance is independent among group members, which is reviewed during discussion of synchronization and coordination of vigilance in a group

Subsequently, in 2006, N. jakovljevicii was also found in the same oxbow on reed stems as well. In the following years it appeared in another oxbow, suggesting an expanding distribution in the tributaries of the Danube in Hungary. The Hungarian population can be characterised as having mixed morphological features in comparison with other known N. jakovljevicii populations of Europe. When the morphological study was expanded, a similar, but 'giant form' was detect ed in fossil material. We found similarities and a possible connection between N. jakovljevicii and Navicula lucida, a diatom taxon described from a Neogene deposit in the Carpathian Basin. Despite the morphological similarities in the shape, apices, striae pattern and raphe structure of these two species, there are significant differences in valve dimensions: the valves of N. lucida are larger and more heavily silicified than N. jakovljevicii.},

Their ability to fix dissolved N2 allows cyanobacteria to circumvent the general summer nitrogen limitation, while also generating a supply of novel bioavailable nitrogen for the food web. However, the fate of the nitrogen fixed by cyanobacteria remains unresolved, as does its importance for secondary production in the Baltic Sea. Here, we synthesize recent experimental and field studies providing strong empirical evidence that cyanobacterial nitrogen is efficiently assimilated and transferred in Baltic food webs via two major pathways: directly by grazing on fresh or decaying cyanobacteria and indirectly through the uptake by other phytoplankton and microbes of bioavailable nitrogen exuded from cyanobacterial cells. This information is an essential step toward guiding nutrient management to minimize noxious blooms without overly reducing secondary production, and ultimately most probably fish production in the Baltic Sea.},

	abstract = {Decline in surf scoter (Melanitta perspicillata) waterfowl populations wintering in the Chesapeake Bay has been associated with changes in the availability of benthic bivalves. The Bay has become more eutrophic, causing changes in the benthos available to surf scoters. The subsequent decline in oyster beds (Crassostrea virginica) has reduced the hard substrate needed by the hooked mussel (Ischadium recurvum), one of the primary prey items for surf scoters, causing the surf scoter to switch to a more opportune species, the dwarf surfclam (Mulinia lateralis). The composition (macronutrients, minerals, and amino acids), shell strength (N), and metabolizable energy (kJ) of these prey items were quantified to determine the relative foraging values for wintering scoters. Pooled samples of each prey item were analyzed to determine composition. Shell strength (N) was measured using a shell crack compression test. Total collection digestibility trials were conducted on eight captive surf scoters. For the prey size range commonly consumed by surf scoters (6–12 mm for M. lateralis and 18–24 mm for I. recurvum), I. recurvum contained higher ash, protein, lipid, and energy per individual organism than M. lateralis. I. recurvum required significantly greater force to crack the shell relative to M. lateralis. No difference in metabolized energy was observed for these prey items in wintering surf scoters, despite I. recurvum’s higher ash content and harder shell than M. lateralis. Therefore, wintering surf scoters were able to obtain the same amount of energy from each prey item, implying that they can sustain themselves if forced to switch prey.},

We investigated the acute effects of nano-TiO2 on metabolic activity and viability of algae and cyanobacteria using high-throughput screening. The responses of three diatoms (Surirella angusta, Cocconeis placentula, Achnanthidium lanceolatum), one green alga (Scenedesmus quadricauda), and three cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa, Gloeocapsa sp., Synechococcus cedrorum) to short-term exposure (15 to 60 min) to a common nano-TiO2 pigment (PW6; average crystallite size 81.5 nm) with simulated solar illumination were assessed. Five concentrations of nano-TiO2 (0.5, 2.5, 5, 10, and 25 mg L-1) were tested and a fluorescent reporter (fluorescein diacetate) was used to assess metabolic activity. Algae were sensitive to nano-TiO2, with all showing decreased metabolic activity after 30-min exposure to the lowest tested concentration. Microscopic observation of algae revealed increased abundance of dead cells with nano-TiO2 exposure. Cyanobacteria were less sensitive to nano-TiO2 than algae, with Gloeocapsa showing no significant decrease in activity with nano-TiO2 exposure and Synechococcus showing an increase in activity. These results suggest that nanomaterial contamination has the potential to alter the distribution of phototrophic microbial taxa within freshwater ecosystems. The higher resistance of cyanobacteria could have significant implications as cyanobacteria represent a less nutritious food source for higher trophic levels and some cyanobacteria can produce toxins and contribute to harmful algal blooms.},

	abstract = {The Azorean barnacle, Megabalanus azoricus (Pilsbry, 1916), is a Macaronesian endemic whose obscure taxonomy and the unknown relationships among forms inhabiting isolated Northern Atlantic oceanic islands is investigated by means of molecular analysis herein. Mitochondrial data from the 16S rRNA and COX1 genes support its current species status, tropical ancestry, and the taxonomic homogeneity throughout its distribution range. In contrast, at the intraspecific level and based on control region sequences, we detected an overall low level of genetic diversity and three divergent lineages. The haplogroups α and γ were sampled in the Azores, Madeira, Canary, and Cabo Verde archipelagos; whereas haplogroup β was absent from Cabo Verde. Consequently, population analysis suggested a differentiation of the Cabo Verde population with respect to the genetically homogenous northern archipelagos generated by current oceanographic barriers. Furthermore, haplogroup α, β, and γ demographic expansions occurred during the interglacial periods MIS5 (130 Kya - thousands years ago -), MIS3 (60 Kya), and MIS7 (240 Kya), respectively. The evolutionary origin of these lineages is related to its survival in the stable southern refugia and its demographic expansion dynamics are associated with the glacial-interglacial cycles. This phylogeographic pattern suggests the occurrence of genetic discontinuity informative to the delimitation of an informally defined biogeographic entity, Macaronesia, and its generation by processes that delineate genetic diversity of marine taxa in this area.},

	abstract = {Le sélénium (Se) est un élément essentiel, mais une concentration interne cinq fois plus élevée que celle nécessaire peut induire des effets toxiques. Son écotoxicologie a été très étudiée, mais plusieurs mécanismes d’accumulation et d’effet ne sont pas compris. Nous avons mesuré les concentrations de trois espèces chimiques du sélénium (sélénite, séléniate et séléniures organiques) dans l’eau d’une quinzaine de lacs des régions de Sudbury, Ontario et Rouyn-Noranda, Québec. Ces mesures ont été comparées avec les concentrations de sélénium ([Se]) dans une chaîne trophique planctonique composée de microplancton (algues et bactéries), de crustacés planctoniques et de larves du diptère Chaoborus. Ce sont les concentrations de séléniures organiques dissous qui sont les mieux corrélées avec les [Se] dans cette chaîne trophique, mais l’addition des concentrations de séléniate rend les corrélations plus fortes. Afin de comprendre les mécanismes derrière ces observations, nous avons exposé l’algue verte unicellulaire Chalmydomonas reinhardtii à la même concentration de sélénite, de séléniate ou de sélénométhionine, au laboratoire, mais à des concentrations variables de sulfate, d’ions hydrogène et ce, pour plusieurs durées d’exposition. Ces expériences démontrent que l’accumulation par cette algue verte est plus importante lorsqu’exposée au séléniate qu’au sélénite, mais à des concentrations de sulfate très élevées, la prise en charge de sélénite est un peu plus importante. Par contre, l’accumulation de sélénométhionine n’a pas été influencée par les concentrations de sulfate. À des [SO4] représentatives des lacs étudiés, les [Se] chez l’algue étaient trois fois plus élevées lorsqu’exposée à la sélénométhionine qu’aux espèces inorganiques. Dans toutes les conditions expérimentales, les [Se] chez C. reinhardtii étaient faibles comparativement à celles mesurées dans le microplancton naturel des lacs, et ce à de plus faibles concentrations aqueuses. Nous avons donc récolté le microplancton du lac Bédard (lac témoin) au nord de la ville de Québec et exposé ces organismes aux mêmes conditions que l’algue verte. Ces expériences démontrent que les [Se] chez microplancton naturel étaient 30 fois plus élevées que celles de C. reinhardtii lorsqu’exposés à la sélénométhionine. Contrairement à l’algue, les [Se] chez le microplancton étaient plus élevées lorsqu’exposé au sélénite qu’au séléniate. De façon générale, pour une concentration donnée de Se dissous, l’accumulation de la forme organique sera supérieure à celle observée pour les formes inorganiques, mais l’accumulation préférentielle des espèces chimiques du sélénium est étroitement liée aux types de micro-organisme étudiés. Ces données de laboratoire nous ont permis d’estimer les [Se] mesurées chez les organismes pélagiques des lacs étudiés.Nous n’avons pas observé de bioamplification du Se dans la chaîne trophique pélagique constituée d’invertébrés et de microplancton pélagiques, mais une bioamplification du Se a été observée entre les perchaudes et leur proie. De plus, lorsque les perchaudes se nourrissent davantage de proies venant des sédiments, elles sont exposées à des [Se] plus élevées. Effectivement, nous avons obtenu des régressions négatives entre la signature isotopique de soufre (δ34S) et les [Se] dans les perchaudes et leurs proies suggérant que plus les organismes se nourrissent dans un environnement anoxique, plus ils sont exposés au Se. Les chironomes qui consomment les sédiments (p. ex. Chironomus) sont les invertébrés avec les plus fortes [Se]. Nous suggérons donc de les utiliser pour les évaluations du risque environnemental afin d’estimer l’exposition maximale potentielle des perchaudes.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerSelenium (Se) is an essential element, but an internal concentration five times higher than that necessary can induce toxic effects. Its ecotoxicology has been extensively studied, but several mechanisms of accumulation and effect are not understood. We measured the concentrations of three chemical species of selenium (selenite, selenate and organic selenides) in the water of fifteen lakes in the regions of Sudbury, Ontario and Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec. These measurements were compared with the concentrations of selenium ([Se]) in a planktonic trophic chain composed of microplankton (algae and bacteria), planktonic crustaceans and larvae of the Diptera Chaoborus. Dissolved organic selenide concentrations correlate best with [Se] in this food chain, but adding selenate concentrations makes the correlations stronger. In order to understand the mechanisms behind these observations, we exposed the unicellular green alga Chalmydomonas reinhardtii to the same concentration of selenite, selenate or selenomethionine, in the laboratory, but to varying concentrations of sulphate, hydrogen ions and this, for multiple exposure times. These experiments demonstrate that the accumulation by this green algae is greater when exposed to selenate than to selenite, but at very high sulfate concentrations, the uptake of selenite is somewhat greater. In contrast, selenomethionine accumulation was not influenced by sulfate concentrations. At [SO4] representative of the lakes studied, the [Se] in the algae was three times higher when exposed to selenomethionine than to the inorganic species. In all experimental conditions, [Se] in C. reinhardtii were low compared to those measured in natural lake microplankton, at lower aqueous concentrations. We therefore collected microplankton from Lac Bédard (control lake) north of Quebec City and exposed these organisms to the same conditions as green algae. These experiments demonstrate that the [Se] in natural microplankton was 30 times higher than that of C. reinhardtii when exposed to selenomethionine. Unlike algae, [Se] in microplankton were higher when exposed to selenite than to selenate. In general, for a given concentration of dissolved Se, the accumulation of the organic form will be greater than that observed for the inorganic forms, but the preferential accumulation of the chemical species of selenium is closely linked to the types of microorganisms studied. These laboratory data allowed us to estimate the [Se] measured in the pelagic organisms of the lakes studied.We did not observe Se biomagnification in the pelagic food chain consisting of pelagic invertebrates and microplankton, but Se biomagnification was observed between yellow perch and their prey. In addition, when yellow perch feed more on sediment prey, they are exposed to higher [Se]. Indeed, we obtained negative regressions between the isotopic signature of sulfur (δ34S) and [Se] in yellow perch and their prey suggesting that the more organisms feed in an anoxic environment, the more they are exposed to Se. Sediment-eating chironomids (eg Chironomus) are the invertebrates with the highest [Se]. We therefore suggest using them for environmental risk assessments to estimate the maximum potential exposure of yellow perch.},

The first part of this thesis describes the development of the gastropod Crepidula williamsi and compares it to the closely related C. fornicata, with a focus on changes in allocation to macromeres and the development of a functional gut.  The second part is a phylogenetic comparison of egg size and allocation to macromeres in 44 species of spiralians, which revealed a significant correlation between the two.  A phylogenetic comparison like this one has not previously been done on the development of such diverse marine invertebrate taxa.},

	abstract = {One in four Americans aged 65 years or older is clinically depressed. A growing body of research suggests subclinical depression influences mood, affect, cortisol dysregulation, and autonomic imbalance. Depression is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Posited to underlie these changes are shifts in sympathovagal balance toward excessive sympathetic arousal and/or decreased vagal inhibitory influences on the heart rate.     Nine studies suggest a 10-minute fast and variable thinking (FVT) exercise improves mood in nonsymptomatic student populations. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated pre-to-post FVT effects on mood, perception of thought speed, depression severity, and changes in physiology, that is, heart rate variability (HRV), temperature, and electrodermal response (EDR) in 30 subclinical depressed females aged 50 to 69 as compared to paired controls.       A paired samples t-test was run to assess mean FVT changes in mood, depression severity, and physiology using the PANAS-X, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, HRV, temperature, and EDR, respectively. A linear regression and ANOVA measured within and between group changes in positive mood and perception of thought speed.      The results showed that fast and variable thinking decreased negative mood (p = .04) and depression severity (p = .02) while maintaining positive mood levels. Perception of thought speed had a very weak mediating effect. Physiologically, \%HF (p = .04) and Temperature (p = .002) decreased below baseline post-intervention. Respiration Rate (RSP) did not recover post-intervention. \%HF, Temperature, and RSP suggest a possible hypo-parasympathetic response. Relative pre-to-post mean increases in SDNN, RMSSD, pNN50, and HRV Amplitude values in conjunction with EDR recovery suggest resilience and a positive health status. Disparate findings post-intervention may be age and health related. Additional research is needed to determine if the initial sympathetic arousal eventuates in improved health long term.     This study suggests it is possible to feel less depressed and less negative without feeling subjectively positive. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that fast and variable thinking may be an effective tool for improving mood in subclinical depressed women.},

	abstract = {Ohio’s original heavily forested landscape included glacial lakes, large rivers, and streams that teemed with an abundant variety of fish, most of which remain resident today. Native Fishes of Ohio documents the more than 130 species originally found in the state and describes how their aquatic habitats have evolved as a result of agriculture and industrial development. Naturalist Dan Rice and photographer Gary Meszaros draw upon more than 40 years of fieldwork and recent hands-on experience to detail the natural history of each species of Ohio fish. The authors provide field identification characteristics and describe each fish’s habitat, ecology, and distribution. The book is profusely illustrated with Gary Meszaros’s spectacular color photographs of live specimens in their natural environment, a resource unique to this volume. The range of shapes and vivid colors will give the reader insight into the fascinating world of the state’s native fishes. An ideal resource for the nonspecialist, Native Fishes of Ohio will interest nature lovers, teachers, and anglers and is a must for every Ohio school and public library.},

	abstract = {THE HORROR STORY: If aggressive bees make you perspire heavily, imagine how you'd react facing a six-metre snake in the wild. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, about 99,000 Burmese pythons were imported to the U.S. between 1996 and 2006. The big problem arose when these snakes became too big for their tanks and owners started illegally releasing them into the wild. Officials in Florida estimate between 30,000 and 300,000 of the huge snakes infest Everglades National Park, and that number is rising because they have few predators. There is no evidence they hunt humans in the wild, but pythons feast on a wide array of endangered species. "Alligators up to five feet long (1.5 metres) have been found inside the bellies of captured pythons, as have a wide variety of native endangered species who have no defence against the scaly serpents," warns the website webecoist.com. It is now illegal to import the giant reptiles without a permit, and Florida has created a "Python Patrol" of about 400 trained responders who will humanely remove snakes spotted by the public.              THE HORROR STORY: OK, Africanized honey bees aren't exactly massing on our border with the U.S., but these scary pests have in recent years become the poster children for invasive species. We personally are terrified of regular bees, let alone hybrid bugs that have spawned such realistic horror films as 1978's The Swarm, wherein a gigantic squadron of the insects kills thousands of innocent Texans who attempt to defend themselves with helicopters and flamethrowers. Rated the No. 6 invasive species by Time.com, the so-called killer bees originated in Brazil in 1957 when a replacement beekeeper accidentally released 26 Tanzanian queen bees that mated with native European honeybees, creating an especially aggressive hybrid that has created an agricultural horror, along with some really bad movies. These invaders take over the hives of regular bees, kill the queen and install their own leader. They infiltrated the U.S. in 1990 and have since spread throughout many of the southern states. Their venom is no deadlier than that of traditional honey bees, but they can inflict 10 times as many stings than their calmer cousins. A 62-year-old Texas farmer suffered a painful death earlier this year when his tractor disturbed a hive containing an estimated 40,000 killer bees. "In addition to being a threat to humans, they are also relatively lousy at producing honey -- making them a threat to agriculture as well," warns Time.com.},

	abstract = {As the result of the ecological impacts from the use of tributyltins (TBT) in shipping, environmental legislation for the registration of chemicals for use in the environment has grown to a monumental challenge requiring product dossiers to include information on the environmental fate and behavior of any chemicals. Specifically, persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity, collectively known as PBT, are properties of concern in the assessment of chemicals. However, existing measurements of PBT properties are a cumbersome and expensive process, and thus not applied in the early stages of the product discovery and development. Inexpensive methods for preliminary PBT screening would minimize risks arising with the subsequent registration of products. In this article, we evaluated the PBT properties of compounds reported to possess anti-fouling properties using QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) prediction programs such as BIOWIN(TM) (a biodegradation probability program), KOWWIN(TM) (log octanol-water partition coefficient calculation program) and ECOSAR(TM) (Ecological Structure Activity Relationship Programme). The analyses identified some small (Mr {\textless} 400) synthetic and natural products as potential candidates for environmentally benign biocides. We aim to demonstrate that while these methods of estimation have limitations, when applied with discretion, they are powerful tools useful in the early stages of research for compound selection for further development as anti-foulants.},

	abstract = {Predator–prey interactions have a major effect on species abundance and diversity, and aggregation is a well-known anti-predator behaviour. For immobile prey, the effectiveness of aggregation depends on two conditions: (a) the inability of the predator to consume all prey in a group and (b) detection of a single large group not being proportionally easier than that of several small groups. How prey aggregation influences predation rates when visual cues are restricted, such as in turbid water, has not been thoroughly investigated. We carried out foraging (predation) experiments using a fish predator and (dead) chironomid larvae as prey in both laboratory and field settings. In the laboratory, a reduction in visual cue availability (in turbid water) led to a delay in the location of aggregated prey compared to when visual cues were available. Aggregated prey suffered high mortality once discovered, leading to better survival of dispersed prey in the longer term. We attribute this to the inability of the dead prey to take evasive action. In the field (where prey were placed in feeding stations that allowed transmission of olfactory but not visual cues), aggregated (large groups) and semi-dispersed prey survived for longer than dispersed prey—including long term survival. Together, our results indicate that similar to systems where predators hunt using vision, aggregation is an effective anti-predator behaviour for prey avoiding olfactory predators.},

The book presents research on the core issues of climate-change science in the treeless arctic region of Alaska. As a whole, it examines both terrestrial and freshwater-aquatic ecosystems, and their three typical habitats: tundra, streams, and lakes. The book provides a history of the Toolik Lake LTER site, and discusses its present condition and future outlook. It features contributions from top scientists from many fields, creating a multidisciplinary survey of the Alaskan arctic ecosystem. Chapter topics include glacial history, climatology, land-water interactions, mercury found in the Alaskan arctic, and the response of these habitats to environmental change. The final chapter predicts the consequences that arctic Alaska faces due to global warming and climate change, and discusses the future ecology of the LTER site in the region. Alaska's Changing Arctic is the definitive scientific survey of the past, present, and future of the ecology of the Alaskan arctic.},

	abstract = {Paleolimnology combines the disciplines of limnology, geology and ecology, but because of challenges that separate investigators from direct knowledge about past lake conditions, the field is multidisciplinary by necessity. As a result, paleolimnology is influenced continuously by advances in many disciplines. As with limnological studies in recent decades, paleolimnology has diverged largely from the ecological and theoretical focuses of early investigators, but recent studies demonstrate the need for more integration of ecological and paleolimnological research. This paper provides a brief overview of recent paleolimnological investigations that have addressed questions related to theoretical ecology, as well as applied lake-management and climate research issues. We examine the use of transfer function models for estimating past water-quality conditions, and important caveats expressed by investigators about limitations in the development and use of such models. Paleolimnological research has contributed new insights about biological, physical and chemical processes in lakes that have been subject to change because of climate drivers and anthropogenic influences. These findings are relevant to predicting how lakes will respond to climate change, and will require new management approaches in the future. As the range of paleolimnological studies expands, there will be greater need for basic limnological research in order for paleolimnological investigators to better understand how sediments reflect lake processes of those regions.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0095316},
	abstract = {For many organisms, the reconstruction of source-sink dynamics is hampered by limited knowledge of the spatial assemblage of either the source or sink components or lack of information on the strength of the linkage for any source-sink pair. In the case of marine species with a pelagic dispersal phase, these problems may be mitigated through the use of particle drift simulations based on an ocean circulation model. However, when simulated particle trajectories do not intersect sampling sites, the corroboration of model drift simulations with field data is hampered. Here, we apply a new statistical approach for reconstructing source-sink dynamics that overcomes the aforementioned problems. Our research is motivated by the need for understanding observed changes in jellyfish distributions in the eastern Bering Sea since 1990. By contrasting the source-sink dynamics reconstructed with data from the pre-1990 period with that from the post-1990 period, it appears that changes in jellyfish distribution resulted from the combined effects of higher jellyfish productivity and longer dispersal of jellyfish resulting from a shift in the ocean circulation starting in 1991. A sensitivity analysis suggests that the source-sink reconstruction is robust to typical systematic and random errors in the ocean circulation model driving the particle drift simulations. The jellyfish analysis illustrates that new insights can be gained by studying structural changes in source-sink dynamics. The proposed approach is applicable for the spatial source-sink reconstruction of other species and even abiotic processes, such as sediment transport.},

It is increasingly recognized that private land conservation is an essential part of environmental protection and especially properties of non-farm, private landowners are interesting for conservation purposes. However, non-farm, private landowners are less likely to respond to traditional motivators for environmental conservation and little is known about the conservation attitudes and values of this group. Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis was used as the approach because of its practical ability to reveal how personal contexts and experiences shape these relationships and how personal meaning is created. These relationships increase quality of life, give a sense of belonging, and motivate a desire to protect the land against environmental degradation. The present private landowners expressed a well-developed conservation ethic. However, future conservation approaches for these properties are less clear, but might be achieved through conservation easement programs.},

	abstract = {Among the many biological responses studied in ecotoxicology, energy-based biomarkers such as digestive enzyme activities and energy reserves appear to be useful predictive tools for detecting physiological disturbances in organisms. However, the use of these biological responses as biomarkers could be limited by the effects of confounding factors (biotic and abiotic) and physiological processes, such as the reproductive cycle. Thus, the optimal use of these biomarkers will be facilitated by understanding the effects of these factors on the energy metabolism of the sentinel species being studied. We considered abiotic factors (temperature and conductivity) in a previous study, whereas the present study investigated the effects of gender, the female reproductive stage, and food availability on the digestive enzyme activities and energy storage of Gammarus fossarum. The results indicated that, during the female reproductive cycle, the activities of digestive enzymes (amylase, cellulase, and trypsin) decreased significantly, whereas the levels of reserves (proteins, lipids, and sugar) increased until the last premolt stage. Restricted food diets only led to decreased amylase activities in both sexes. Food starvation also induced a decrease in the energy outcomes in females, whereas there were no effects in males. In general, the biochemical (digestive enzyme activities) and physiological (energy reserves) responses were more stable in males than in females. These results support the use of males fed ad libitum to limit the effects of confounding factors when using these energy biomarkers in Gammarus fossarum during biomonitoring programs.},

The book presents research on the core issues of climate-change science in the treeless arctic region of Alaska. As a whole, it examines both terrestrial and freshwater-aquatic ecosystems, and their three typical habitats: tundra, streams, and lakes. The book provides a history of the Toolik Lake LTER site, and discusses its present condition and future outlook. It features contributions from top scientists from many fields, creating a multidisciplinary survey of the Alaskan arctic ecosystem. Chapter topics include glacial history, climatology, land-water interactions, mercury found in the Alaskan arctic, and the response of these habitats to environmental change. The final chapter predicts the consequences that arctic Alaska faces due to global warming and climate change, and discusses the future ecology of the LTER site in the region.

	abstract = {Le déversement de 40000 m³ à 170000 m³ de déchets liquides dans une gravière désaffectée, situées dans la ville de Mercier à 20 km au sud de Montréal, a causé de sérieux problèmes de contamination des eaux souterraines. Les lagunes ainsi formées contenaient des produits provenant des industries, soit principalement des déchets d’industries chimiques et pétrochimiques. La présence de ces polluants organiques peut compromettre le système immunitaire des organismes aquatiques et altérer l’activité enzymatique impliquée dans les phases de biotransformation du xénobiotique.Notre travail vise une étude écotoxicologique des eaux souterraines de Mercier. Dans un premier temps, nous avons examiné via des tests in vitro, l’effet immunotoxique de l’exposition des leucocytes de truites aux eaux souterraines, échantillonnées auprès de 13 puits situés dans le panache des lagunes. En effet, les résultats ont révélé que la capacité phagocytaire et l’efficacité phagocytaire ont été diminuées significativement pour 4 puits sur /13 et 6 puits sur /13 respectivement. La prolifération des lymphocytes B et T stimulée aux mitogènes a été augmentée parmi des échantillons. Dans un deuxième volet, les expériences in vivo ont permis de démontrer que les réponses étaient différentes selon la distance des puits échantillonnés. Une analyse factorielle discriminante faite pour classer et déterminer les différences entre les sites situés à des distances de (1,2 km), (2,7 km) et (5,4km) des lagunes, a révélé que le site d’échantillonnage à 2,7 km était le plus contaminé. Toutefois, l’activité phagocytaire a été stimulée chez les truites exposées à ces eaux ce qui suggère une immunostimulation. En plus, les lymphocytes T étaient plus sensibles à la réponse humorale que les lymphocytes B. D’autre part, une augmentation du nombre de cellules apoptotiques induites à la dexamethaxone a été observée chez les truites exposées aux eaux souterraines de Mercier ce qui indique une plus grande susceptibilité du système immunitaire au stress. Une perturbation du cycle cellulaire des lymphocytes a été aussi mise en évidence chez les truites exposées aux eaux souterraines dans le panache, ce qui suggère une perte de son contrôle et son altération contribue à l’oncogénèse.Dans un troisième temps, nous avons mis en évidence l’effet toxique de ces eaux par la mesure de deux types de biomarqueurs soient; les biomarqueurs de défense (éthoxyrésorufine O-dééthylase(EROD) et glutathion S-transférase (GST)) et ceux des lésions tissulaires (peroxydation lipidique (LPO) et les cassures de brins d’ADN). Les résultats ont montré une induction de l’activité EROD chez les poissons exposés aux eaux de puits à 1,17 km et 5,40 km, alors qu’une inhibition de l’activité a été enregistrée chez les poissons exposés aux eaux du puits à 2.74 km. Une inhibition de l’activité GST et une induction de la génotoxicité ont été observées en conséquence.La solution choisie pour contrôler la contamination et restaurer la nappe phréatique de Mercier, était l’implantation des pièges hydrauliques d’où l’eau contaminée serait pompée, traitée puis rejetée dans les eaux de surface. Notre dernier volet vise à étudier l’immunotoxicité de ces eaux traitées et non traitées suite à une exposition in vivo des truites. Les résultats démontrent que les contaminants présents dans les eaux avant et après traitement peuvent moduler les compétences de bases comme la phagocytose et la prolifération des lymphocytes.Dans l’ensemble, nos travaux suggèrent que le système immunitaire, le système de biotransformation, l’intégrité de l’ADN, le cycle cellulaire et l’apoptose peuvent être affectés par l’exposition aux eaux souterraine de Mercier. De plus, il ressort que les eaux traitées et rejetées dans les eaux de surface pourraient constituer une menace pour le système immunitaire des organismes qui y vivent.Enfin, l’utilisation des biomarqueurs dans l’évaluation de la toxicité des eaux souterraines de Mercier n’aurait pas eu d’intérêt et de signification que dans le cadre d’une approche multi-marqueur. Seule cette approche a permis de fournir une expertise valable dans le contexte d’un mélange complexe de produits chimiques. Cela comprend donc une complémentarité de biomarqueurs liés à la génotoxicité, à l’immunotoxicité et à la biodégradation du toxique.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerThe dumping of 40,000 m³ to 170,000 m³ of liquid waste in a disused gravel pit, located in the town of Mercier, 20 km south of Montreal, caused serious groundwater contamination problems. The lagoons thus formed contained products from industries, mainly waste from chemical and petrochemical industries. The presence of these organic pollutants can compromise the immune system of aquatic organisms and alter the enzymatic activity involved in the biotransformation phases of the xenobiotic.Our work aims at an ecotoxicological study of groundwater in Mercier. First, we examined via in vitro tests, the immunotoxic effect of exposure of trout leukocytes to groundwater, sampled from 13 wells located in the plume of the lagoons. Indeed, the results revealed that the phagocytic capacity and the phagocytic efficiency were significantly reduced for 4 wells out of /13 and 6 wells out of /13 respectively. Mitogen-stimulated B and T cell proliferation was increased among samples. In a second part, the in vivo experiments made it possible to demonstrate that the responses were different depending on the distance from the wells sampled. A discriminant factor analysis made to classify and determine the differences between the sites located at distances of (1.2 km), (2.7 km) and (5.4 km) from the lagoons, revealed that the sampling site at 2.7 km was the most contaminated. However, phagocytic activity was stimulated in trout exposed to these waters suggesting immunostimulation. In addition, T lymphocytes were more sensitive to the humoral response than B lymphocytes. increased susceptibility of the immune system to stress. A disruption of the lymphocyte cell cycle was also demonstrated in trout exposed to groundwater in the plume, which suggests a loss of its control and its alteration contributes to oncogenesis.Thirdly, we highlighted the toxic effect of these waters by measuring two types of biomarkers; defense biomarkers (ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)) and those of tissue damage (lipid peroxidation (LPO) and DNA strand breaks). Results showed induction of EROD activity in fish exposed to well waters at 1.17 km and 5.40 km, while inhibition of activity was recorded in fish exposed to well waters at 2.74 km. Inhibition of GST activity and induction of genotoxicity were observed as a result.The solution chosen to control contamination and restore the water table of Mercier was the installation of hydraulic traps from which the contaminated water would be pumped, treated and then discharged into surface water. Our last part aims to study the immunotoxicity of these treated and untreated waters following in vivo exposure of trout. The results demonstrate that the contaminants present in water before and after treatment can modulate basic skills such as phagocytosis and lymphocyte proliferation.Overall, our work suggests that the immune system, biotransformation system, DNA integrity, cell cycle, and apoptosis may be affected by exposure to Mercier groundwater. In addition, it appears that treated water discharged into surface waters could pose a threat to the immune system of the organisms that live there.Finally, the use of biomarkers in the assessment of the toxicity of groundwater in Mercier would only have been of interest and significance within the framework of a multi-marker approach. Only this approach has made it possible to provide valid expertise in the context of a complex mixture of chemicals. This therefore includes a complementarity of biomarkers linked to genotoxicity, immunotoxicity and biodegradation of the toxicant.},

A research span expanded over five decades has revealed their molecular characterization, gene regulation, expression patterns, vast similarity in diverse groups, and broad range of functional capabilities. Their functions include protection and tolerance against cytotoxic conditions through their molecular chaperoning activity, maintaining cytoskeleton stability, and assisting in cell signaling. However, their role as biomarkers for monitoring the environmental risk assessment is controversial due to a number of conflicting, validating, and nonvalidating reports. The current knowledge regarding the interpretation of HSPs expression levels has been discussed in the present review. The candidature of heat shock proteins as biomarkers of toxicity is thus far unreliable due to synergistic effects of toxicants and other environmental factors. The adoption of heat shock proteins as "suit of biomarkers in a set of organisms" requires further investigation.},

The removal of some highly effective broad-spectrum chemicals, caused by concerns over environmental health and public safety, has resulted in the development of alternative, reduced risk crop protection products. These products, less toxic to the environment and easily integrated into biological control systems, target specific life stages or pest species. Predation OCo recognized as a suitable, long-term strategy OCo effectively suppresses pests in biotechnological control systems. 
"Integrated Pest Management" covers these topics and more. It explores the current ecological approaches in alternative solutions, such as biological control agents, parasites and predators, pathogenic microorganisms, pheromones and natural products as well as ecological approaches for managing invasive pests, rats, suppression of weeds, safety of pollinators, role of taxonomy and remote sensing in IPM and future projections of IPM. This book is a useful resource to entomologists, agronomists, horticulturists, and environmental scientists.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0079516},
	abstract = {Background 
The Asian clam (Corbicula fluminea) is currently one of the most economically important aquatic species in China and has been used as a test organism in many environmental studies. However, the lack of genomic resources, such as sequenced genome, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and transcriptome sequences has hindered the research on C. fluminea. Recent advances in large-scale RNA-Seq enable generation of genomic resources in a short time, and provide large expression datasets for functional genomic analysis.
Methodology/Principal Findings
We used a next-generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technique with an Illumina GAIIx method to analyze the transcriptome from the whole bodies of C. fluminea. More than 62,250,336 high-quality reads were generated based on the raw data, and 134,684 unigenes with a mean length of 791 bp were assembled using the Velvet and Oases software. All of the assembly unigenes were annotated by running BLASTx and BLASTn similarity searches on the Nt, Nr, Swiss-Prot, COG and KEGG databases. In addition, the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs), Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) annotations were also assigned to each unigene transcript. To provide a preliminary verification of the assembly and annotation results, and search for potential environmental pollution biomarkers, 15 functional genes (five antioxidase genes, two cytochrome P450 genes, three GABA receptor-related genes and five heat shock protein genes) were cloned and identified. Expressions of the 15 selected genes following fluoxetine exposure confirmed that the genes are indeed linked to environmental stress.
Conclusions/Significance
The C. fluminea transcriptome advances the underlying molecular understanding of this freshwater clam, provides a basis for further exploration of C. fluminea as an environmental test organism and promotes further studies on other bivalve organisms.},

Poisoning and serious chronic effects in humans, such as cancer, have been described. On the other hand, many cyanobacterial genera have been studied for their toxins with anticancer potential in human cell lines, generating promising results for future research toward controlling human adenocarcinomas.

However, the increasing use of nanosilver has raised concerns about its environmental impacts. Long-term exposure studies with aquatic invertebrates are essential to assess possible adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. In the present study, acute (48 h), chronic (21 d) and long-term effects of nanosilver (primary size 15 nm) on five successive generations of three Daphnia species (D. magna, D. pulex, and D. galeata) were investigated. Acute EC50 values of nanosilver were 121 µg Ag L−1 for D. magna being the least sensitive species and 8.95 and 13.9 µg Ag L−1 for D. pulex and D. galeata, respectively. Chronic exposure provided EC10 values of 0.92 µg Ag L−1 for D. magna showing the most sensitive chronic reaction and 2.25 and 3.45 µg Ag L−1 for D. pulex and D. galeata, respectively. Comparative exposure to AgNO3 revealed a generally higher toxicity of the soluble form of silver. The multi-generation experiments resulted in effects on the population level for all tested species. Exposure of D. magna indicated an increased toxicity of nanosilver in the fifth generation of animals exposed to 10 µg Ag L−1. Neonates from pre-exposed parental daphnids did not completely recover when transferred into clean water. Exposure of D. pulex and D. galeata revealed not only increasing toxicity in some generations, but also greater tolerance to nanosilver. This study contributes to the assessment of the risk potential of nanosilver on aquatic ecosystems. It shows that effects of nanosilver vary within one genus and change with exposure duration. Therefore, long-term studies considering different aquatic species are needed to better understand the possible effects of nanosilver on aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Here we summarize the current knowledge on the transfer and accumulation of harmful algal bloom (HAB)-related toxins in cephalopods (octopods, cuttlefishes and squids). These mollusks have been reported to accumulate several HAB-toxins, namely domoic acid (DA, and its isomers), saxitoxin (and its derivatives) and palytoxin (and palytoxin-like compounds) and, therefore, act as HAB-toxin vectors in marine food webs. Coastal octopods and cuttlefishes store considerably high levels of DA (amnesic shellfish toxin) in several tissues, but mainly in the digestive gland (DG)-the primary site of digestive absorption and intracellular digestion. Studies on the sub-cellular partitioning of DA in the soluble and insoluble fractions showed that nearly all DA (92.6\%) is found in the cytosol. This favors the trophic transfer of the toxins since cytosolic substances can be absorbed by predators with greater efficiency. The available information on the accumulation and tissue distribution of DA in squids (e.g., in stranded Humboldt squids, Dosidicus gigas) is scarcer than in other cephalopod groups. Regarding paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), these organisms accumulate them at the greatest extent in DG {\textgreater}{\textgreater} kidneys {\textgreater} stomach {\textgreater} branchial hearts {\textgreater} posterior salivary glands {\textgreater} gills. Palytoxins are among the most toxic molecules identified and stranded octopods revealed high contamination levels, with ovatoxin (a palytoxin analogue) reaching 971 μg kg-1 and palytoxin reaching 115 μg kg-1 (the regulatory limit for PlTXs is 30 μg kg-1 in shellfish). Although the impacts of HAB-toxins in cephalopod physiology are not as well understood as in fish species, similar effects are expected since they possess a complex nervous system and highly developed brain comparable to that of the vertebrates. Compared to bivalves, cephalopods represent a lower risk of shellfish poisoning in humans, since they are usually consumed eviscerated, with exception of traditional dishes from the Mediterranean area.},

In addition to its pathogenicity against invertebrates, different B. laterosporus strains show a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity including activity against phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi. A wide variety of molecules, including proteins and antibiotics, have been associated with the observed pathogenicity and mode of action. Before being considered as a biological control agent against plant pathogens, the antifungal and antibacterial properties of certain B. laterosporus strains have found medical interest, associated with the production of antibiotics with therapeutic effects. The recent whole genome sequencing of this species revealed its potential to produce polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and toxins. Another field of growing interest is the use of this bacterium for bioremediation of contaminated sites by exploiting its biodegradation properties.

Here, we investigated potential changes of maternal provisioning over the whole reproductive period in a gastropod with a mixed development: Crepidula fornicata. In its introduction area, C. fornicata reproduces from February to October, which implies that both adults and larvae are exposed to different food availabilities. Maternal provisioning was assessed by measuring the fatty acid (FA) composition of females, encapsulated embryos and larvae, in February, May, July and September 2009. FA are essential resources for the development of embryos and larvae, and are key biomarkers of offspring quality. Our results showed differences in FA composition between muscles, visceral masses, and encapsulated embryos. In particular, FA composition of embryos was similar to that of the visceral mass. Seasonal variations in FA composition were observed: in the middle of the reproductive season (May and July), female tissues and embryos showed a higher proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids and especially ω3, as compared to the beginning and end of the reproductive season (February and September). This showed that through maternal provisioning the quality of C. fornicata offspring was higher in the middle of the reproductive season.

Determining the information that each signal component conveys has provided unique insights into why multimodal signals evolve. However, how these complex signals are assessed by receivers will also influence their evolution, a hypothesis that has received less attention. Here, we explore multimodal signal assessment in a closely related complex of island flycatchers that have diverged in visual and acoustic signals. Using field experiments that manipulated song and plumage colour, we tested if song, a possible long-range signal, is assessed before plumage colour in conspecific recognition. We find that divergent song and colour are assessed in sequence, and this pattern of sequential assessment is likely mediated by habitat structure and the extent of differences in signal characteristics. A broad survey of the literature suggests that many organisms from a wide range of taxa sequentially assess multimodal signals, with long-range signals attracting conspecifics for further assessment of close-range signals. Our results highlight the need to consider how signals are assessed when understanding multimodal signal evolution. Finally, given the results of our field experiments indicating sequential assessment of divergent song and colour in the recognition of conspecifics, we discuss the consequences of multimodal signal divergence for the origin of species, as changes in signals across different sensory modalities may influence the evolution of premating reproductive isolation.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {[Jacqueline Madill]'s subject was the important but little-understood or appreciated, 'Native Fresh-water Mussells of the Ottawa Valley' and she brought many several favourite specimens to the talk. About one-third of the world's mussell species live in North America, with 55 species in Canada, of which 41 are found in Ontario. Madill reminded us first thing that we should not pick up mussells from the river bottom; each species inhabits only a specific water zone and they have limited locomotion. Not only that but freshwater mussells are considered one of the most endangered group of species in North America, with 67 per cent at risk!


Madill and others assess mussel biodiversity and numbers in local lakes and rivers as part of their work. Hinge structure and other features are used for identification and often identification can be made just by the feel of the shell underwater. Mussell species may vary in numbers from zero to a few, to such density one cannot walk without treading on a shell. Here they earn the names 'Heelsplitter' and 'Ouch'! Other more 'happy as a clam' individuals are rainbow, warty back and maple leaf. Eastern Elliptis is a very common species locally, and others such as a Cylindrical Papershell found in Quebec, had not been seen since the 1830s.


For example, the female Pocket-Book Mussell extends its mantle, the tip of which is shaped, marked and moves like a small fish. This attracts a desired larger fish for a lift. When the fish 'takes the bait' the mussell ejects a puff of glochidia that attach to the gills, thus obtaining a convenient taxi for its young! Other species mimic a worm to attract a 'ride'. Check out YouTube. com for videos of some of these creative mussel displays, says Madill. What can we do to improve the health of our waters and native freshwater Molluscs? How can we make a mussel as "happy as clam?" If you would like further information, please contact our speaker, she welcomes inquiries and can be contacted at the Canadian Nature Museum Research Building in Gatineau or via email at jmadill@mus-nature.ca. An excellent reference guide to local mussels is by J. Metcalfe-Smith, A. MacKenzie, I. Carmichael and D. McGoldrick, Photo Field Guide to the Freshwater Mussels of Ontario, 2005, published by the St. Thomas Field Naturalist Club.},

The aim of this study was to provide the first large broad-scale insight into the genetic variability of P. nobilis in the area that encompasses the western Mediterranean, Ionian Sea, and Adriatic Sea marine ecoregions. To accomplish this objective twenty-five populations from this area were surveyed using two mitochondrial DNA markers (COI and 16S). Our dataset was then merged with those obtained in other studies for the Aegean and Tunisian populations (eastern Mediterranean), and statistical analyses (Bayesian model-based clustering, median-joining network, AMOVA, mismatch distribution, Tajima’s and Fu’s neutrality tests and Bayesian skyline plots) were performed. The results revealed genetic divergence among three distinguishable areas: (1) western Mediterranean and Ionian Sea; (2) Adriatic Sea; and (3) Aegean Sea and Tunisian coastal areas. From a conservational point of view, populations from the three genetically divergent groups found may be considered as different management units.},

	abstract = {The distribution of breeding resources, such as nest sites, can have a pronounced impact on a population by affecting the proportion of individuals that succeed to breed and hence, the variation in reproductive success. Aggregation of important resources can lead to resource monopolisation by a limited number of individuals and thus affect the intensity of sexual selection. In this study, we tested, by contrasting two experimental treatments (dispersed vs. aggregated), how nest distribution affects: (1) mating behaviour, (2) male nest occupation and mating success, and (3) reproductive success and the opportunity for selection. We used the two-spotted goby (Gobiusculus flavescens), a small marine fish with a resource-based mating system, as our model species. When nests were aggregated, a larger proportion of the males behaved aggressively, fewer males succeeded in occupying a nest, fewer males became mated, and those males that mated received fewer eggs from spawning females. These effects resulted in a higher variance in reproductive success and hence, a higher opportunity for selection (I {\textasciicircum}sub rs{\textasciicircum}), in the aggregated treatment. We suggest that the results are a direct consequence of males defending a territory around their nest, preventing competitively inferior males from breeding. However, we found no significant selection differentials for body length or condition of males in either treatment. Our results support the hypothesis that aggregation of essential resources like nests promotes resource monopolisation. In species facing highly clumped nesting resources in the wild, monopolisation may negatively impact population productivity but could lead to strong selection on traits that promote male competitive ability.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The limited data available on iodine tolerance in cats support a provisional tolerated level of 5 mg I/kg complete feed. Consumers exposure was calculated in two scenarios applying the currently authorised maximum iodine contents in feed and reduced contents. The iodine content of food of animal origin, if produced taking account of the currently authorised maximum iodine content in feed, would represent a substantial risk to high consumers. The risk would originate primarily from milk consumption and to a minor extent from eggs. The UL for adults (600 µg/day) and for toddlers (200 µg/day) would be exceeded by a factor of 2 and 4, respectively. If the authorised maximum iodine concentrations for dairy cows and laying hens were reduced to 2 and 3 mg I/kg feed, respectively, the exposure of adult consumers would be below the UL. However, iodine intake in high‐consuming toddlers would remain above the UL (1.6‐fold). The formulated additive could pose a risk by inhalation to users. The preparation is non irritant to skin and eyes but may be a dermal sensitiser; coating may prevent the contact of the active substance to skin and eyes. The use of calcium iodate in animal nutrition is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. Calcium iodate is efficacious to meet iodine requirements. The FEEDAP Panel recommends the maximum iodine contents in complete feed be reduced: dairy cows/minor dairy ruminants, 2 mg I/kg; laying hens, 3 mg I/kg; horses, 3 mg I/kg; dogs, 4 mg I/kg; cats, 5 mg I/kg.},

The resulting predicted environmental concentrations (PECs) are compared with measured environmental concentrations (MECs) from Europe, based on a large dataset incorporating more than 1800 single MECs. On the effects side, available chronic ecotoxicity data from the literature were complemented by additional, new chronic results for fish and other organisms. Based on these data, chronic-based deterministic predicted no effect concentrations (PNECs) were derived as well as two different probabilistic PNEC ranges. The ERA compares surface water PECs and MECs with aquatic PNECs for TMP.

In this work, genetic diversity and population differentiation of C. edule has been assessed using 11 microsatellite markers in eight locations from the European Atlantic coast. All localities showed similar observed and expected heterozygosity values, but displayed differences in allelic richness, with lowest values obtained for localities situated farther north. Global Fst value revealed the existence of significant genetic structure; all but one locality from the Iberian Peninsula were genetically homogeneous, while more remote localities from France, The Netherlands, and Scotland were significantly different from all other localities. A combined effect of isolation by distance and the existence of barriers that limit gene flow may explain the differentiation observed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Sampling was carried out using bottom trawl in depths of 3-6 m, from January to November 2005, and from October to November 2008. Pimelodus pintado began to prey upon L. fortunei soon after its arrival (austral spring of 2005). On the spring of 2008, L. fortunei was found to be the most important food item of P. pintado. The variation in length of the mussels (0.7-3.2 cm, with a mode of 1.3 cm) indicates that the species is now fully established in the system. Our data indicates that large individuals of P. pintado incorporate more mussels in their diets than small individuals. However, regardless of their size, P. pintado individuals predate only on small ({\textless}1.4 cm) representatives of L. fortunei. This prey size corresponds to a phase when the mussel is more mobile and readily available for fish. Larger, more aggregated prey groups that are attached to hard substrates are avoided by fish predators.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

For common species and those that breed in the state, each account begins with an interesting fact (such as, “Red-breasted Mergansers have been clocked at over 80 mph, the fastest recorded flight speed for a duck . . .”) and provides information on Texas distribution and harvest, population status, diet, range and habitats, reproduction, and appearance. Exquisite photographs, informative distribution maps, and a helpful source list accompany the species descriptions, and the book offers a glossary and full bibliography for those who want to explore the literature further. With the degradation and disappearance of the inland and coastal habitats that these birds depend upon, the natural history of these waterfowl species provides a vital reminder of the interconnectedness and crucial importance of all wetlands. Birders, biologists, landowners, hunters, outdoor enthusiasts, and all those interested in the health and preservation of our coastal and inland wetland resources will enjoy and learn from this book.},

	abstract = {Mythological studies deepens and layers the significance of fashion and dress through an archetypal exploration of Greek goddess fashion archetypes--Aphrodite, Athena, Artemis, and Hestia. The research reveals how these archetypes and their shadows influence the fashion industry from the creation of a garment to when it is worn on the body. The production component of the dissertation entails archetypal fashion design curriculum that contains an instructor's guide for an archetypal women's fashion design course at the collegiate level. The study is tailored to expand fashion design students' understanding of fashion silhouettes and design elements that fit certain fashion archetypes and how the fashion archetypes manifest within target markets, consumers' styles, and consumption choices. The theoretical portion of the research examines fashion theory as a multidisciplinary approach through which to investigate why the body is covered. Within fashion theory, mythological studies offers a new perspective through which to study fashion archetypally by canvassing Greek and Roman myths tied to the four goddesses and by exploring depth psychological and Jungian concepts, such as archetypes, shadow, psyche, and the collective unconscious as they relate to fashion.     The research concludes: a woman's fashion identity and personal style convey one or more goddess fashion archetypes; to express identity and style, garments on the body communicate a visual story about oneself to others that relates to one or more of the goddesses' stories (or myths) archetypally; goddess fashion archetypes categorize fashion silhouettes, such as dresses, pants, and gowns, as well as archetypal goddess fashion silhouette themes, such as masculine/structured, feminine/sensual, functional/comfortable, or conservative/playful; and clothing the body is due to an instinctual drive that is informed by Greek goddess archetypes in Western fashion. Further implications for this research include creating a guide for consumers to understand their preferred archetypal style, employing fashion archetypes to retail when merchandising clothing stores and purchasing inventory for consumers, and developing god fashion archetypes, such as Zeus, Hermes, Ares, Dionysus, and Hephaistos for men's fashion.},

	abstract = {Pollutant loadings in two watersheds, Mulberry and Catoma were assessed using the pollutant loading (PLOAD) model and model results were compared with those obtained from field sampling followed by laboratory analysis. The PLOAD model was used to determine water pollutants including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), orthophosphate (PO43-), nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) in two watersheds, Mulberry and Catoma that are part of the Alabama River Basin. Results revealed that both Mulberry and Catoma watersheds had TN and TP values that exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits set for rivers and streams. The TN and TP values were in the range of hypertrophic for lakes, and eutrophic for rivers. The PLOAD model results were in agreement with analytical results. We conclude that PLOAD is a valid model for determining pollutant loading in watersheds and provides a relatively faster and cheaper method of assessing impairment of watershed bodies compared to conventional methods.},

	abstract = {This study addresses how nineteenth-century Americans perceived the lands of the Eastern Mediterranean. The project rests upon a detailed examination of American primary school geography textbooks that enjoyed widespread circulation during the century. The lack of an effective education apparatus in the period rendered American students incredibly reliant on their textbooks. These texts reflect the general common knowledge of the region shared by most educated Americans. Additionally, this study draws support from a thorough analysis of travel accounts that were extraordinarily popular during the period. These works offered Americans a chance to explore vicariously the most interesting lands of the Levant.   Nineteenth-century Americans sought to locate their essential place, meaning and mission within a universal system of world processes. Geography authors fulfilled this social need by providing students with a systemized structure of knowledge about the Eastern Mediterranean. This framework enabled students to address the complex realities of the region in a simplified and palatable manner – a process that also used to satisfy various social pressures. This episteme of the Eastern Mediterranean provided the context for Americans to regulate their self-meanings and cultural missions in the nineteenth century. Often, the concepts of this knowledge structure took the form of dichotomies which acted as defining antitheses. Students located themselves within these oppositions which became constructs of Sameness and Otherness. The structured framework of knowledge about the Levant provided the setting in which these processes played out. Thus, the people, places, and practices of the region were marked as aspects of “us” and “them” – of heritage and Otherness.},

Ahmed Hussen's book is to date the only one to reconcile the two standpoints. The central focus of the book will continue to be on this systematic integration of both mainstream and ecological approaches to environmental economics, and an acknowledgement that enduring solutions to major contemporary environmental challenges can be obtained through studies based on a well-conceived and balanced interdisciplinary approach. However, this third edition also contains much that is new. Chiefly, brand new chapters appear covering the following topics: The economics of climate change The economics of biodiversity and ecosystem services 'Green' accounting and alternative economic and social indicators of sustainability The business case for environmental sustainability An Appendix that provides a brief historical account of the development of ecological economics The result is a comprehensive introduction to the main facets of environmental and ecological economics -- a text that boldly refuses to put up barriers between disciplines and takes a holistic approach to vital issues. This student-friendly textbook contains a variety of study tools including learning points, boxed features, case studies, revision questions and discussion questions, and an Appendix that provides students with a review of basic economic principles relevant to the study of the environment and its management. Written in a clear and accessible style, this book will prove an excellent choice for introducing both students and academics to the world of environmental economics.},

	abstract = {Corneal structure is highly organized and unified in architecture with structural and functional integration which mediates transparency and vision. Disease and injury are the second most common cause of blindness affecting over 10 million people worldwide. Ninety percent of blindness is permanent due to scarring and vascularization. Scarring caused via fibrotic cellular responses, heals the tissue, but fails to restore transparency. Controlling keratocyte activation and differentiation are key for the inhibition and prevention of fibrosis. Ophthalmic surgery techniques are continually developing to preserve and restore vision but corneal regression and scarring are often detrimental side effects and long term continuous follow up studies are lacking or discouraging. Appropriate corneal models may lead to a reduced need for corneal transplantation as presently there are insufficient numbers or suitable tissue to meet demand. Synthetic optical materials are under development for keratoprothesis although clinical use is limited due to implantation complications and high rejection rates. Tissue engineered corneas offer an alternative which more closely mimic the morphological, physiological and biomechanical properties of native corneas. However, replication of the native collagen fiber organization and retaining the phenotype of stromal cells which prevent scar-like tissue formation remains a challenge. Careful manipulation of culture environments are under investigation to determine a suitable environment that simulates native ECM organization and stimulates keratocyte migration and generation.},

	abstract = {Two goose-type lysozymes (designated as MGgLYZ1 and MGgLYZ2) were identified from the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. MGgLYZ1 mRNA was widely expressed in the examined tissues and responded sensitively to bacterial challenge in hemocytes, while MGgLYZ2 mRNA was predominately expressed and performed its functions in hepatopancreas. However, immunolocalization analysis showed that both these lysozymes were expressed in all examined tissues with the exception of adductor muscle. Recombinant MGgLYZ1 and MGgLYZ2 could inhibit the growth of several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and they both showed the highest activity against Pseudomonas putida with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.95–1.91 µM and 1.20–2.40 µM, respectively. Protein sequences analysis revealed that MGgLYZ2 had lower isoelectric point and less protease cutting sites than MGgLYZ1. Recombinant MGgLYZ2 exhibited relative high activity at acidic pH of 4–5, while MGgLYZ1 have an optimum pH of 6. These results indicated MGgLYZ2 adapted to acidic environment and perhaps play an important role in digestion. Genomic structure analysis suggested that both MGgLYZ1 and MGgLYZ2 genes are composed of six exons with same length and five introns, indicating these genes were conserved and might originate from gene duplication during the evolution. Selection pressure analysis showed that MGgLYZ1 was under nearly neutral selection while MGgLYZ2 evolved under positive selection pressure with three positively selected amino acid residues (Y102, L200 and S202) detected in the mature peptide. All these findings suggested MGgLYZ2 perhaps served as a digestive lysozyme under positive selection pressure during the evolution while MGgLYZ1 was mainly involved in innate immune responses.},

	abstract = {Species can sometimes spread significant distances beyond their natural dispersal ability by anthropogenic means. International shipping routes and the transport of shipping containers, in particular are a commonly recognised pathway for the introduction of invasive species. Species can gain access to a shipping container and remain inside, hidden and undetected for long periods. Currently, government biosecurity agencies charged with intercepting and removing these invasive species when they arrive to a county’s border only assess the most immediate point of loading in evaluating a shipping container’s risk profile. However, an invasive species could have infested a container previous to this point and travelled undetected before arriving at the border. To assess arrival risk for an invasive species requires analysing the international shipping network in order to identify the most likely source countries and the domestic ports of entry where the species is likely to arrive. We analysed an international shipping network and generated pathway simulations using a first-order Markov chain model to identify possible source ports and countries for the arrival of Khapra beetle (Trogoderma granarium) to Australia. We found Kaohsiung (Taiwan) and Busan (Republic of Korea) to be the most likely sources for Khapra beetle arrival, while the port of Melbourne was the most likely point of entry to Australia. Sensitivity analysis revealed significant stability in the rankings of foreign and Australian ports. This methodology provides a reliable modelling tool to identify and rank possible sources for an invasive species that could arrive at some time in the future. Such model outputs can be used by biosecurity agencies concerned with inspecting incoming shipping containers and wishing to optimise their inspection protocols.},

	abstract = {The acanthocephalan parasite Polymorphus minutus is a manipulator of its intermediate host Gammarus roeseli, which favours its transmission to the final host, a water bird. In contaminated environments, G. roeseli have to cope with two stresses, i.e. P. minutus infection and pollutants. As P. minutus survival relies on its host's survival, we investigated the influence of P. minutus on the antitoxic defence capacities and the energy reserves of G. roeseli females after cadmium exposure. In parallel, malondialdehyde, a toxic effect biomarker, was measured in G. roeseli females and in P. minutus. The results revealed that infected females displayed higher cell damage than uninfected ones, despite an apparent increase in reduced glutathione and metallothionein production. In fact, the increase of these antitoxic systems could be counterbalanced by carotenoid intake by the parasite, so that the overall defence system seemed less efficient in infected females than in uninfected ones. In addition, we demonstrated that cadmium induced cell damage in P. minutus, probably linked with cadmium accumulation in the parasite. Altogether, we observed a paradoxical pattern of responses suggesting that P. minutus increases cadmium toxicity in G. roeseli females although (i) it tends to increase several host antitoxic defence capacities and (ii) it bears part of the pollutant, as reflected by cell damage in the parasite.},

	abstract = {What is a natural habitat? Who can define what is natural when species and ecosystems constantly change over time, with or without human intervention? When a polluted river or degraded landscape is restored from its damaged state, what is the appropriate outcome? With climate change now threatening greater disruption to the stability of ecosystems, how should restoration ecologists respond? Ecological Restoration and Environmental Change addresses and challenges some of these issues which question the core values of the science and practice of restoration ecology. It analyzes the paradox arising from the desire to produce ecological restorations that fit within an historical ecological context, produce positive environmental benefits and also result in landscapes with social meaning. Traditionally restorationists often felt that by producing restorations that matched historic ecosystems they were following nature's plans and human agency played only a small part in restoration. But the author shows that in reality the process of restoration has always been defined by human choices. He examines the development of restoration practice, especially in North America, Europe and Australia, in order to describe different models of restoration with respect to balancing ecological benefit and cultural value. He develops ways to balance more actively these differing areas of concern while planning restorations. The book debates in detail how coming global climate change and the development of novel ecosystems will force us to ask new questions about what we mean by good ecological restoration. When the environment is constantly shifting, restoration to maintain biodiversity, local species, and ecosystem functions becomes even more challenging. It is likely that in the future ecological restoration will become a never-ending, continuously evolving process.},

Many advances in water quality have led to unquestionable improvements in ecosystem quality, habitat and biodiversity, and water infrastructure. Still, Great Lakes scientists have issued compelling evidence that the ecological health of the basin ecosystem is at significant risk. In 2012, the Agreement will be revised for the first time in 25 years. The degree of engagement in a future Agreement, including scope, issues of significant importance, governance and collaboration will hinge on a thorough analytical process, so far seemingly absent, coupled with real consultation, so far marginally evident. Renegotiating the Agreement to generate a revitalized and sustainable future mandates that science inform contemporary public policy, and that inclusive discourse and public engagement be integral through the process. Many of these steps are still absent, and the analysis presented here strongly suggests that the constituents of the Great Lakes regime voice their views critically, emphatically, and often. If the negotiators listen, we can collectively make the Lakes Great.},

Samples of muscle, liver, kidney, brain, male and female reproductive organs and adipose tissue of fish and both parasites were analyzed for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn, by ICP-MS. Mean concentrations of individual heavy metals in all fish samples decreased in the order zinc {\textgreater} copper {\textgreater} manganese {\textgreater} mercury {\textgreater} arsenic {\textgreater} chromium {\textgreater} cadmium {\textgreater} nickel {\textgreater} lead. Zinc was found to be the dominant element and its antagonistic interaction with copper was confirmed. The kidney was a key target organ receiving the highest mean concentrations of all analyzed metals, but some metals showed specific affinity for particular tissues. In terms of human health, concentration of Hg in fish muscle, which exceeded more than two-times its maximum level admitted in foodstuffs in European countries, is of great importance and should be taken into account. Bioaccumulation factors (C[parasite]/C[fish tissue]) calculated for all elements indicated much higher detection skills of A. lucii and P. percae parasites than fish organs and hence, present results allow proposing both parasite models as useful tools to monitor aquatic environmental quality. Acanthocephalans, however, seem to be superior for heavy metal monitoring, also demonstrated under experimental conditions. Present results also indicate the decreasing heavy metal burden of the reservoir and its gradual recovery in the course of time.},

In this fourth edition the text has been completely revised, with new chapters and many new illustrations and full colour photographs. The theme, once again, is the influence of natural selection on behaviour â€“ an animal's struggle to survive and reproduce by exploiting and competing for resources, avoiding predators, selecting mates and caring for offspring, â€“ and how animal societies reflect both cooperation and conflict among individuals. Stuart A. West has joined as a co-author bringing his own perspectives and work on microbial systems into the book. Written in the same engaging and lucid style as the previous editions, the authors explain the latest theoretical ideas using examples from micro-organisms, invertebrates and vertebrates. There are boxed sections for some topics and marginal notes help guide the reader. The book is essential reading for students of behavioural ecology, animal behaviour and evolutionary biology. Key Features: Long-awaited new edition of a field-defining textbook New chapters, illustrations and colour photographs New co-author Focuses on the influence of natural selection on behavior, and how animal societies reflect both cooperation and conflict among individuals â€œThe long-awaited update to a classic in this field is now here, presenting new direcÂ­tions in thinking and addressing burning questions. Richly informed by progress in many other disciplines, such as sensory physiology, genetics and evolutionary theory, it marks the emergence of behavÂ­ioural ecology as a fully fledged disciplineâ€¦.. This is a marvellous book, written in a lucid style. A must-read for those in the field, it is also a cornucopia of new thinking for anyone interested in evolution and behaviour.â€ Manfred Milinski, Nature, 2012},

	abstract = {Grace Before the Fall is an annotated novel that follows a flaneuse on her journey toward love and social activism. It is set in a pre-9/11 New York City, during a week in the summer of 1980.   Geri Lipschultz, in her critical introduction, confronts both the instability and the virtual death of a text (drawing on Robert Scholes and Gayatri Spivak), as well as its revival in the hands of a contemporary reader. Lipschultz positions herself as a new reader in her revision/revival/revitalization of an old text—whose title, contents, and structure have been altered from their original construction thirty years past. She documents her course of revision, which begins with a rupture, itself a consequence of her impulse to investigate the etymology of selected words. Part of her work is an interrogation of the nature of revision itself, which might boil down to the adage offered by Heraclitus: You cannot step into the same river twice.   Lipschultz observes that her novel's initial modernist influences, namely Joyce and Nabokov, have been decentered by the ethos of the postcolonial/postmodern novel, given her changing reading preferences. Her introduction invokes both a personal and a civic history. It introduces the reader not only to the text but also to a paratext that resembles storytelling at times, offering knowledge gleaned only after the fact—for example the way AIDS was ravaging New York without its having a name—and investigates how that retrospective knowledge positions itself for any reader. The revisions within the text, she writes, have provided portal-like openings for character and setting, much as do architectural renovations. The paratext offers historiographic, geographic, and etymological asides—and memoir—whose purpose is to document the passage of time and the metamorphosis of a city. Lipschultz paints these changes with nostalgia and a sense of loss.   She argues that the annotations are not essential. They are there at the reader's discretion—placed as endnotes—as the novel, now situated within a magical realist context, articulates its theme of love and nature in conflict with the powers that be.},

	abstract = {This thesis explores the prevalence of freaks in late nineteenth-century British culture through popular and medical print media. Through their consistent representation and exhibition, freaks became a part of mainstream culture. Due to their regular reproduction, freak narratives and images often perpetuated the lives of freaks long after their deaths; thereby creating freak legacies. This thesis employs the theoretical concept of generativity, drawn from John Kotre’s work, to investigate the role of freaks and freak legacies in late nineteenth-century culture. Generativity is the process which allows the continuation of lives after death, through the creation and perpetuation of legacy. Through their regular representation and reproduction in print, I argue, freaks were generative in that they contributed to the perpetuation of their own and others’ legacies in late nineteenth-century Britain. In particular, the generativity of freak narratives for medical and popular press readerships is considered to demonstrate the multiple ways freak representations were constructed to suit broad and diverse audiences.The first two chapters of this thesis examine popular representations of freaks and the last two look at medicine’s interaction with freak bodies. The first half of this thesis establishes the mainstream status of freaks by exploring their numerous representations in a diverse range of popular print sources. The first chapter demonstrates some of the ways popular media engaged with freaks and their legacies. In the second chapter, the popular appeal of freaks is further explored through a case study of the two UK visits of the Barnum and Bailey circus at the end of the nineteenth century. Particular attention is paid to the generative use of freaks in building the famous showman Phineas T. Barnum’s legacy. Then, the next half of this thesis turns to medical culture to explore the professional engagement with anomalous bodies. Chapter three explores the intricacies of the medicine –freak relationship by demonstrating medicine’s attempts to assert authority over freakish bodies. The final chapter examines the importance of legacy to the medical profession and offers an analysis of three freak case studies which demonstrate this aim. These case studies also make up a chapter in Popular Exhibitions, Science and Showmanship,1840-1910, which is due to be published by Pickering and Chatto in 2012.},

Ils constituent un monde où se retrouvent des espèces « sympathiques » comme l'écureuil ou la marmotte, « effrayantes » comme les rats, ou tout simplement parfaitement inconnues comme nombre de campagnols. Ils peuvent être source de dommages importants ou vecteurs de maladies. En France ils se répartissent en 6 familles (21 genres et 31 espèces). Tout d'abord décrits dans leur rapport avec l'environnement puis avec l'homme, ils sont ensuite présentés dans une monographie illustrée. Cette nouvelle édition fait une synthèse unique et des plus récentes sur le sujet., elle précise les notions développées dans certains chapitres de la précédente édition : santé publique, régulation des populations.

Another problem is that gobies feed on zebra mussels, which sounds like a good thing, to have an invasive species serving as a predator of another invasive species. But contaminants taken in by mussels, thereby staying dormant, are released back into the food chain when the mussels are consumed by the gobies.              Not all species of fish are welcome in Hamilton Harbour, and the round goby is not on the 'catch and release' list. Spectator file},

	abstract = {This book examines the concept of naturalness in ecosystems, discusses its values and considers choices about the level of naturalness in conservation efforts. The author argues that all ecosystems have been modified and the idea of places 'untouched by humans' is a myth. But there are large differences in the degree of modification and levels of naturalness which can be identified. Changes are not always irreversib≤ some apparent wilderness areas are sites of former civilizations. There is no longer any simple distinction possible between 'natural' and 'cultural' systems. In the future, society will, to some extent, choose the degree of naturalness in land and seascapes. The growth of protected areas is an early sign of this, as are changes in forest management, dam removal and control of invasive species. To make informed choices about these areas, the author shows that we must understand the characteristics and values of naturally regulating ecosystems - their practical benefits, social values and management needs.  Authenticity in Nature uses a rigorous definition of authenticity to help in the understanding and measurement of naturalness. It discusses the choices facing us and some of the information we need to make decisions relating to land and water management. Practical issues of management and numerous terrestrial and aquatic examples from around the world are discussed. It is an optimistic and highly original book, aiming to make genuine advances in our understanding and management of natural systems.},

	abstract = {The single authoritative resource on the causes of and successful interventions for water and sanitation-related diseases 
This book presents the most complete treatment possible of the conditions responsible for water and sanitation-related diseases, the pathogens involved and their biology, the morbidity and mortality resulting from lack of safe water and sanitation, the distribution of these diseases, and the conditions that must be met to reduce or eradicate them. Written by experts from the fields of public health, medicine, epidemiology, environmental health, climate change, environmental engineering, and population research, this authoritative volume provides a thorough understanding of the interconnection among many factors linked to water-related diseases, sanitation, and hygiene.
Divided into eight comprehensive sections that address the concerns from an international perspective, this volume covers:


The significance of the close relationships between water access and quality, lack of adequate sanitation and hygiene, and the relationship of human activity to the diseases

Means of accessing clean water and preventing contamination of water

The range of sanitation and hygiene measures available to reduce disease

The broad extent, variety, and ramifications of environmental factors

Ameliorating conditions and preventive measures to reduce pollutants found in ground and surface waters

The adverse health impacts of water pollution, dam construction, irrigation development, and flood control
Preventive measures and innovative, successful solutions are presented throughout, as well as featured in more detail in a special section at the end of the book. This section highlights examples from a diversity of locations in both developed and developing countries, focusing on what has been achieved in the control of water-related diseases--and what can be accomplished if the multi-factorial approach in this book is followed. The accompanying companion website includes this vital information in the form of case studies and articles, providing guidance for possible action on local and national as well as international levels.
This timely text is an essential resource for all graduate students and postdoctoral scholars as well as for professionals in infectious diseases, public health and medicine, chemical and environmental engineering, international affairs, disease prevention, and public policy.

Here, we compared the responses of two life history stages (larval, juvenile) of three species of calcifying bivalves (Mercenaria mercenaria, Crassostrea virginica, and Argopecten irradians) to temperatures (24 and 28°C) and CO2 concentrations (∼250, 390, and 750 ppm) representative of past, present, and future summer conditions in temperate estuaries. Results demonstrated that increases in temperature and CO2 each significantly depressed survival, development, growth, and lipid synthesis of M. mercenaria and A. irradians larvae and that the effects were additive. Juvenile M. mercenaria and A. irradians were negatively impacted by higher temperatures while C. virginica juveniles were not. C. virginica and A. irradians juveniles were negatively affected by higher CO2 concentrations, while M. mercenaria was not. Larvae were substantially more vulnerable to elevated CO2 than juvenile stages. These findings suggest that current and future increases in temperature and CO2 are likely to have negative consequences for coastal bivalve populations.},

The species life cycle involves a larval parasitic stage on freshwater fish species which contributes to the spread of the mussel. In this paper we describe, for the first time, eight polymorphic microsatellite loci for the species Sinanodonta woodiana. The genetic screening of individuals confirmed that all loci were highly polymorphic. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 7 to 14 and the observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.650 to 0.950. These loci should prove useful to study the species population genetics which could help to infer important aspects of the invasion process.},

	abstract = {Stream ecosystems harbor many secretive and imperiled species, and studies of vertebrates in these systems face the challenges of relatively low detection rates and high costs. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has recently been confirmed as a sensitive and efficient tool for documenting aquatic vertebrates in wetlands and in a large river and canal system. However, it was unclear whether this tool could be used to detect low-density vertebrates in fast-moving streams where shed cells may travel rapidly away from their source. To evaluate the potential utility of eDNA techniques in stream systems, we designed targeted primers to amplify a short, species-specific DNA fragment for two secretive stream amphibian species in the northwestern region of the United States (Rocky Mountain tailed frogs, Ascaphus montanus, and Idaho giant salamanders, Dicamptodon aterrimus). We tested three DNA extraction and five PCR protocols to determine whether we could detect eDNA of these species in filtered water samples from five streams with varying densities of these species in central Idaho, USA. We successfully amplified and sequenced the targeted DNA regions for both species from stream water filter samples. We detected Idaho giant salamanders in all samples and Rocky Mountain tailed frogs in four of five streams and found some indication that these species are more difficult to detect using eDNA in early spring than in early fall. While the sensitivity of this method across taxa remains to be determined, the use of eDNA could revolutionize surveys for rare and invasive stream species. With this study, the utility of eDNA techniques for detecting aquatic vertebrates has been demonstrated across the majority of freshwater systems, setting the stage for an innovative transformation in approaches for aquatic research.},

This integration substantially broadens the scope of insect ecology and contributes to prediction and resolution of the effects of current environmental changes, as these affect and are affected by insects. The third edition includes an updated and expanded synthesis of feedback and interactions between insects and their environment. This updated material and a new chapter on applications of insect ecology to social and environmental issues effectively demonstrates how evolutionary and ecosystem approaches complement each other, with the intent of stimulating further integration of these approaches in experiments that address insect roles in ecosystems. Effective management of ecosystem resources depends on evaluation of the complex, often complementary, effects of insects on ecosystem conditions, as well as insect responses to changing conditions.

	abstract = {EFSA was asked by the European Commission to deliver a scientific opinion on polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in food. PBDEs are additive flame retardants which are applied in plastics, textiles, electronic castings and circuitry. PBDEs are ubiquitously present in the environment and likewise in biota and in food and feed. Data from the analysis of 19 PBDE congeners in 3,971 food samples were provided to EFSA by 11 European countries. Eight congeners were considered by the Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) to be of primary interest: BDE‐28, −47, −99, −100, −153, −154, −183 and −209. The highest dietary exposure is to BDE‐47 and −209. Toxicity studies were carried out with technical PBDE mixtures or individual congeners. Main targets were the liver, thyroid hormone homeostasis and the reproductive and nervous system. PBDEs cause DNA damage through the induction of reactive oxygen species. The Panel identified effects on neurodevelopment as the critical endpoint, and derived benchmark doses (BMDs) and their corresponding lower 95 \% confidence limit for a benchmark response of 10 \%, BMDL10s, for a number of PBDE congeners: BDE‐47, 309 μg/kg b.w.; BDE‐99, 12 μg/kg b.w.; BDE 153, 83 μg/kg b.w.; BDE‐209, 1,700 μg/kg b.w. Due to the limitations and uncertainties in the current database, the Panel concluded that it was inappropriate to use these BMDLs to establish health based guidance values, and instead used a margin of exposure (MOE) approach for the health risk assessment. Since elimination characteristics of PBDE congeners in animals and humans differ considerably, the Panel used the body burden as starting point for the MOE approach. The CONTAM Panel concluded that for BDE‐47, −153 and −209 current dietary exposure in the EU does not raise a health concern. For BDE‐99 there is a potential health concern with respect to current dietary exposure.},

There is therefore a trade-off between antipredator behaviours and other activities. This trade-off is generally considered between vigilance and only one other behaviour, thus neglecting potential compensations. In this study, we considered the effect of an increase in predation risk on the diurnal time-budget of three captive duck species during the wintering period. We artificially increased predation risk by disturbing two groups of 14 mallard and teals at different frequencies, and one group of 14 tufted ducks with a radio-controlled stressor. We recorded foraging, vigilance, preening and sleeping durations the week before, during and after disturbance sessions. Disturbed groups were compared to an undisturbed control group. We showed that in all three species, the increase in predation risk resulted in a decrease in foraging and preening and led to an increase in sleeping. It is worth noting that contrary to common observations, vigilance did not increase. However, ducks are known to be vigilant while sleeping. This complex behavioural adjustment therefore seems to be optimal as it may allow ducks to reduce their predation risk. Our results highlight the fact that it is necessary to encompass the whole individual time-budget when studying behavioural modifications under predation risk. Finally, we propose that studies of behavioural time-budget changes under predation risk should be included in the more general framework of the starvation-predation risk trade-off.},

Yet tissue concentrations of some contaminants are especially challenging to interpret and the ability of todayOCOs analytical chemists to provide reliable analytical data of most important environmental contaminants often surpasses the ability of ecotoxicologists to interpret those data. Offering guidance on the ecotoxicologically meaningful interpretation of tissue concentrations, Environmental Contaminants in Biota, Interpreting Tissue Concentrations, Second Edition is updated with current data and new ways of analyzing those data as well as additional contaminants not previously considered. Beginning with a history of wildlife toxicology and data interpretation, chapters cover a wide range of contaminants and their hazardous and lethal concentrations in various animals including DDT, Dioxins, PCBs, and PBDEs in aquatic organisms; methylmurcury, selenium, and trace metals in fishes and aquatic invertebrates; and pharmaceuticals and organic contaminants in marine mammals. The book considers the impact of Polychlorinated Biphenyls, Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and Dibenzofurans, and Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers; cyclodiene; and other organochlorine pesticides in birds and mammals. Later chapters examine the effects and analysis of lead, cadmium, and radionuclides in biota. With thousands of published research papers reporting tissue concentrations each year, Environmental Contaminants in Biota, Interpreting Tissue Concentrations, Second Edition gives ecotoxicologists the ability to draw actionable value regarding the toxicological consequences of those concentrations and relate tissue concentrations quantitatively to injury: the core of ecotoxicology."},

This involved novel bioinformatic analyses, extensive synthesis of the literature, development of a bioinformatic tool, and the transcriptional assessment of the full complement of sghC1q genes within  D. rerio during infection and early development.     The secreted globular head C1q (sghC1q) genes can be characterized as a family of genetic loci each encoding a signal peptide followed by a complement component 1q globular (gC1q) motif. Members of this family have been referred to as precerebellin-like (cblnl), C1q-like or ovary specific C1q-like factors. Previous studies have found gene family members in multiple organisms with varying numbers of copies within a species. The genes are known to be transcribed in response to infection and/or during development.     The domain of the C1q globular head (gC1q or ghC1q) appears to be ancient; present even in prokaryotes. With increasing complexity of organisms, this domain can sometimes be found accompanying first a signal peptide motif (indicative of secretion), and later with a collagen region. A comprehensive naming scheme is suggested based on these evolutionary adaptations. Computational modeling shows the globular head to be structurally conserved throughout the metazoa.     The EST Keeper program was developed to facilitate these studies in identification of sets of non-redundant homologous genes from BLAST results that often contain redundant copies and gene fragments. It was built as a Flash based webservice and can be used to find gene families within genomes and EST datasets.     Twenty sghC1q genes were found in the  D. rerio genome (Zv9) and transcriptionally assessed. Two of the examined twenty genes showed significant up-regulation within 24 h of infection with the fish pathogen Streptococcus iniae, and eleven were expressed during early development. Due to the clustered nature of these genes on chromosomes two and seven, intrachromosomal duplication events are hypothesized and explored.},

The environment is considered the surroundings in which an organism operates, including air, water, land, natural resources, flora, fauna, humans and their interrelation. Water pollution, poor air quality, global warming, acid rain, ozonosphere hole, etc., these issues are featured regularly in our newspapers, news reports and TV programs. Pollution has been used quite freely for many years without a clear definition, and it is generally accepted that environmental pollution can be defined as the contamination of air, water, or soil in such a manner as to cause real or potential harm to human health or well-being, or to damage or harm nonhuman nature without justification. The purpose of this book is to document the latest research in this field.},

	abstract = {The geologically ancient Tidewater region of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina rests precariously atop millions of years of erosion from the nearby Appalachian Mountains. An immense wetland at near sea level, it is host to every conceivable body of fresh water, ranging from brooding swamps and large hidden lakes to sluggish blackwater rivers and brackish sounds (one of which was so large an early explorer thought he had found the Pacific Ocean). In this engaging book, biologist and Tidewater native Roy T. Sawyer delivers an ecohistory of this unique waterland whose wind-driven tides cover a rich human and natural past. Jutting prominently into the Atlantic, this wetland is the final stop for the warmth of the Gulf Stream before it is deflected from the American mainland. At the top of a narrow, warm coastal strip, it provides an ideal home for a vast array of animal and plant life, including prodigious numbers of reptiles (such as the world's northernmost population of alligators) and overwintering waterfowl. It is also home to the oldest known living trees east of the Rocky Mountains. The climate and geography made the area a natural choice for very early human habitation--as far back as the last ice age, when the region was a rich oasis just south of a veritable tundra. In examining the impact of humans upon this environment, and vice-versa, Sawyer reveals how our alarming shortsightedness has produced a fragile and endangered present. Although human manipulation started here as early as ten thousand years ago (coinciding with extinction of mammoths and other megafauna), the environment has been altered most radically over only the last one hundred years, particularly in regard to land drainage, deforestation, overfishing, and pollution. The author provides an authoritative overview of the human impact on these wetlands and suggests ways in which we might still salvage them. In so doing, he explores the effects of hurricanes, droughts, forest fires, and ice ages of the past--and anticipates, in this age of global warming, natural events that may be still to come.},

	abstract = {U.S. mariculture production of bivalve molluscs-those cultivated in the marine environment-has roughly doubled over the last 25 years. Although mariculture operations may expand the production of seafood without additional exploitation of wild populations, they still depend upon and affect natural ecosystems and ecosystem services. Every additional animal has an incremental effect arising from food extraction and waste excretion. Increasing domestic seafood production in the United States in an environmentally and socially responsible way will likely require the use of policy tools, such as best management practices (BMPs) and performance standards. 
BMPs represent one approach to protecting against undesirable consequences of mariculture. An alternative approach to voluntary or mandatory BMPs is the establishment of performance standards for mariculture. Variability in environmental conditions makes it difficult to develop BMPs that are sufficiently flexible and adaptable to protect ecosystem integrity across a broad range of locations and conditions. An alternative that measures performance in sustaining key indicators of ecosystem state and function may be more effective. Because BMPs address mariculture methods rather than monitoring actual ecosystem responses, they do not guarantee that detrimental ecosystem impacts will be controlled or that unacceptable impact will be avoided.
Ecosystem Concepts for Sustainable Bivalve Mariculture finds that while performance standards can be applied for some broad ecosystem indicators, BMPs may be more appropriate for addressing parameters that change from site to site, such as the species being cultured, different culture methods, and various environmental conditions. This book takes an in-depth look at the environmental, social, and economic issues to present recommendations for sustainable bivalve mariculture.

	abstract = {This dissertation examines the British occupation of Fort Haldimand on Carleton Island during the American Revolution and the difficulties in maintaining a military provisioning system to support that garrison. Archaeological evidence from a soldiers’ barrack at the fort is utilized to assess the efficiency of that system and to examine the living conditions of the soldiers. The principle residents of this barrack––and the central figures in this investigation––were soldiers of the 84th Regiment of Foot. The British constructed this post at the head of the St. Lawrence River in 1778 to protect a vital supply route between the interior of North America and the cities of Montréal, Trois-Rivières, and Québec. The island was also a refuge for Britain's Native American allies and Loyalists fleeing New York. In this context the military exerted a substantial economic influence as an agent for the movement of soldiers, civilians, provisions and supplies. The common infantry soldier garrisoned at the fort was dependent on the military unlike troops in urban garrisons; few opportunities existed to augment their supplies from civilian sources. What also makes the archaeological study of the fort unique is that it was not previously, or subsequently, occupied by the French or American military. Carleton Island serves as an excellent opportunity to examine military provisioning and the frontier living conditions of the British soldier during this volatile time in American and Canadian history.},

	abstract = {The first recorded landing by Europeans on the coast of northern East Greenland (north of 69°N) was that of William Scoresby Jr., a British whaler, in 1822. This volume includes a chronological summary of the pioneer 19th century exploration voyages made by British, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, French and German expeditions – all of whom reported that the region had previously been occupied by the Inuit or Eskimo; also included are brief outlines of the increasing number of government and privately sponsored expeditions throughout the 20th century, whose objectives included cartography, geology, zoology, botany, trapping and the ascent of the highest mountain summits.
In 1934 the Place Name Committee for Greenland was established, the tasks of which included a review of all place names hitherto recorded on published maps of Greenland, their formal adoption in danicised form, and the approval or rejection of new name proposals. In northern East Greenland, by far the largest numbers of new place names were those proposed by scientists associated with Lauge Koch's geological expeditions that lasted from 1926 until 1958. This volume records the location and origin of more than 3000 officially approved place names as well as about 2650 unapproved names.
The author's interest in the exploration history and place names of northern East Greenland started in 1968, when the Geological Survey of Greenland initiated a major five-year geological mapping programme in the Scoresby Sund region. Systematic compilation of names began about 1970, initially with the names given by William Scoresby Jr., and subsequently broadened in scope to include the names proposed by all expeditions to northern East Greenland. The author has participated in 16 summer mapping expeditions with the Survey to northern East Greenland. Publication of this volume represents the culmination of a lifetime working in the Arctic.},

	abstract = {Doing Environmental Ethics offers a way to face our ecological crisis that draws on environmental science, economic theory, international law, and religious teachings, as well as philosophical arguments. It engages readers in constructing ethical presumptions based on our duty (to other persons and species and also to ecosystems), our character (personal virtues), our relationships (with other persons and nature), and our rights (to sustainable development and a healthy environment). Then it tests these moral presumptions by predicting the likely consequences of acting on them. Readers apply what they have learned to specific policy issues discussed in the final part of the book: sustainable consumption, environmental policy, clean air and water, agriculture, managing public lands, urban ecology, and climate change. Questions after each chapter and a worksheet aid readers in deciding how to live more responsibly as consumers and as citizens. “What you do matters,” Robert Traer writes, “and the person you are also matters. In ethics we look for reasons to explain why this is so.Author Robert Traer builds on a commonsense understanding of doing what is right and being a good person and suggests how, with a deeper sense of self and one’s place in nature, we can begin to change our “carbon footprint.”},

	abstract = {Background  
Elucidating geographic locations from where migratory birds are recruited into adult breeding populations is a fundamental but largely elusive goal in conservation biology. This is especially true for species that breed in remote northern areas where field-based demographic assessments are logistically challenging.
Methodology/Findings
Here we used hydrogen isotopes (δD) to determine natal origins of migrating hatch-year lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) harvested by hunters in the United States from all North American flyways during the hunting seasons of 1999–2000 (n = 412) and 2000–2001 (n = 455). We combined geospatial, observational, and analytical data sources, including known scaup breeding range, δD values of feathers from juveniles at natal sites, models of δD for growing-season precipitation, and scaup band-recovery data to generate probabilistic natal origin landscapes for individual scaup. We then used Monte Carlo integration to model assignment uncertainty from among individual δD variance estimates from birds of known molt origin and also from band-return data summarized at the flyway level. We compared the distribution of scaup natal origin with the distribution of breeding population counts obtained from systematic long-term surveys.
Conclusions/Significance
Our analysis revealed that the proportion of young scaup produced in the northern (above 60°N) versus the southern boreal and Prairie-Parkland region was inversely related to the proportions of breeding adults using these regions, suggesting that despite having a higher relative abundance of breeding adults, the northern boreal region was less productive for scaup recruitment into the harvest than more southern biomes. Our approach for evaluating population declines of migratory birds (particularly game birds) synthesizes all available distributional data and exploits the advantages of intrinsic isotopic markers that link individuals to geography.},

Thanks to advances in molecular genetics, scientists can now determine an animal's degree of inbreeding or compare genetic variation of a captive species to wild or natural populations. Mapping an organism's genetic makeup recasts such terms as biodiversity and species and enables the conservation of rare or threatened species, populations, and genes. By introducing a new paradigm for studying and preserving life at a variety of levels, genomics offers solutions to previously intractable problems in understanding the biology of complex organisms and creates new tools for preserving the patterns and processes of life on this planet. Featuring a number of high-profile researchers, this volume introduces the use of molecular genetics in conservation biology and provides a historical perspective on the opportunities and challenges presented by new technologies. It discusses zoo-, museum-, and herbarium-based biological collections, which have expanded over the past decade, and covers the promises and problems of genomic and reproductive technology. The collection concludes with the philosophical and legal issues of conservation genetics and their potential effects on public policy.},

It also evaluated the relationships between calcium, mercury and selenium in the mussel tissues. The mussel populations from the deep, meso-oligotrophic Lake Maggiore and the shallow, eutrophic Lake Candia were analyzed. The mean concentration of mercury in the tissues was 0.075 mg kg-1 in Lake Maggiore mussels and 0.033 mg kg-1 in Lake Candia mussels. The local mercury content in the mussel biomass per surface unit was about eleven-fold higher in Lake Maggiore (5.99 μg Hg m-2) than in Lake Candia (0.55 μg Hg m-2). This wide difference was due firstly to the larger population density (46.86 vs 6.93 ind m-2) and secondly to the higher individual content (0.128 vs 0.079 μg Hg ind-1) in Lake Maggiore than in Lake Candia. These differences in population density and individual mercury content are the result of both biological and environmental characteristics. Lake trophy and water renewal affect population density and individual growth rate, and ultimately determine their impact on biogeochemical cycles by regulating the mussel standing stock. The relationships between mercury, calcium and selenium were taken into account.},

	abstract = {La spennatogenèse est un processus nécessitant de nombreuses interactions entre cellules genninales et somatiques. Les jonctions lacunaires sont identifiées comme jouant un rôle important dans la communication cellulaire. Les jonctions lacunaires permettent le passage bi­directionnel de petites molécules (pr 1 kDa) entre cellules adjacentes. Ce sont des structures composées de deux com1exons, eux-mêmes constitués par six protéines oligomérisées autour d'un pore central, appelées connexines (Cxs). Panni ces protéines, la Cx43 est présente dans le testicule de rongeurs et d'humain et des études ont démontré qu'une baisse de Cx43 dans le testicule entraînait une diminution de la spennatogenèse, voire son inhibition complète.L'omble de fontaine est un salmonidé qui se reproduit chaque automne. Durant la spermatogenèse, les cellules gem1inales se développent de façon synchrone. Il devient alors aisé de suivre étape par étape ce processus, et d'étudier avec précision chaque stade de maturation des gonades.L'objectif principal de cette thèse était de déterminer si les Cxs régulent la spermatogenèse chez 1'omble de fontaine. Plus précisément, nous avons défini quatre sous­ objectifs : 1) identifier et localiser les connexines dans le testicule de truite arc-en-ciel ; 2) étudier l'impact des effluents municipaux sur les niveaux d'expression des ARNm des connexines chez l'omble de fontaine; 3) établir le lien entre les honnones stéroïdiennes et l'expression des connexines, chez l'omble de fontaine; et 4) étudier les mécanismes de régulation du promoteur de cx43.Les résultats obtenus ont pem1is d'identifier quatre Cxs possédant une expression et une localisation spécifique dans le testicule de la truite arc-en-ciel (Oncorhynchus mykiss) et de l'omble de fontaine (Salvelinus fontinalis) (Cx43, Cx43.4, Cx30 et Cx31). De plus, l'exposition d'ombles de fontaine à des effluents municipaux a pennis de montrer l'augmentation précoce des niveaux de Cx43 et Cx31 dans le testicule d'individus dont la spermatogenèse était initiée. Ces résultats suggèrent le rôle possible de la Cx43 comme marqueur précoce de la maturation. Les suivis des variations des hormones stéroïdes, des Cxs et des récepteurs aux androgènes, aux hormones thyroïdiennes et de la gonadotropine 1, ont pennis d'observer les niveaux des Cxs durant la spermatogenèse et de montrer in vitro que les niveaux de cx43 n'étaient pas régulés par la 11-CT, mais dépendant des niveaux d'AMPc (messager secondaire de la GtH 1) et de T3. Enfin, nous avons étudié le promoteur de cx43. Une séquence partielle de 607 pb de son promoteur a été séquencée. Des expériences de retardement sur gel, puis des expériences de transfection avec différents fragments du promoteur de cx43 d'omble de fontaine dans des cellules gonadiques de truite arc-en-ciel (RTG-2) ont démontré que la fixation de C/EBP et tr­-beta sur le promoteur activait 1'expression de cx43 confinnant ainsi les observations précédentes.En conclusion, ces travaux ont pennis d'identifier et de localiser pour la première fois ces quatre Cxs dans le testicule de salmonidés et de montrer que leur expression varie durant la spermatogenèse. Toutefois, la 11-CT n'a aucun effet sur les niveaux d'ARNm de cx43, à l'inverse de la FSH et de T3 qui semblent augmenter son expression dans le testicule d'omble de fontaine.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerSpennatogenesis is a process requiring numerous interactions between gennial and somatic cells. Gap junctions are identified as playing an important role in cell communication. Gap junctions allow the bidirectional passage of small molecules (pr 1 kDa) between adjacent cells. These are structures made up of two complexes, themselves made up of six oligomerized proteins around a central pore, called connexins (Cxs). Among these proteins, Cx43 is present in the testis of rodents and humans and studies have shown that a drop in Cx43 in the testis leads to a reduction in spennatogenesis, or even its complete inhibition.The brook trout is a salmonid that spawns each fall. During spermatogenesis, geminal cells develop synchronously. It then becomes easy to follow this process step by step, and to study with precision each stage of gonad maturation.The main objective of this thesis was to determine if Cxs regulate spermatogenesis in brook trout. More specifically, we defined four sub-objectives: 1) identify and localize connexins in the rainbow trout testis; 2) study the impact of municipal effluents on connexin mRNA expression levels in brook trout; 3) establish the link between steroid hormones and connexin expression in brook trout; and 4) study the regulatory mechanisms of the cx43 promoter.The results obtained made it possible to identify four Cxs with a specific expression and localization in the testis of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) (Cx43, Cx43.4, Cx30 and Cx31). In addition, exposure of brook trout to municipal effluents has shown the early increase in levels of Cx43 and Cx31 in the testis of individuals whose spermatogenesis was initiated. These results suggest the possible role of Cx43 as an early marker of maturation. Monitoring variations in steroid hormones, Cxs and androgen receptors, thyroid hormones and gonadotropin 1, allowed us to observe Cxs levels during spermatogenesis and to show in vitro that cx43 levels were not not regulated by 11-CT, but dependent on cAMP (secondary messenger of GtH 1) and T3 levels. Finally, we studied the cx43 promoter. A 607 bp partial sequence of its promoter has been sequenced. Gel retardation experiments followed by transfection experiments with different fragments of the brook trout cx43 promoter in rainbow trout gonadal cells (RTG-2) demonstrated that binding of C/EBP and tr-beta on the promoter activated the expression of cx43 thus confirming the previous observations.In conclusion, this work has made it possible to identify and localize these four Cxs for the first time in the salmonid testis and to show that their expression varies during spermatogenesis. However, 11-CT has no effect on cx43 mRNA levels, unlike FSH and T3 which seem to increase its expression in the brook trout testis.},

Using new evidence and cases from across the globe, Environment and Citizenship explores the new vocabulary of ecological citizenship and examines how successful environmental policy-making depends on the responsible actions of citizens and civil society organizations as much as on governments and international treaties. This accessible and thought-provoking book:- provides a comprehensive and timely guide to the debates on environmental and ecological citizenship, expertly combining examples of practice with theory;- examines how environmental movements have become increasingly involved in governance processes at the local, national, regional and intergovernmental levels;- explores the increasing importance of corporations and transnational networks through examples of stakeholding processes and participatory research in environmental decision-making;- calls on researchers, policy-makers and activists to face a new challenge: how to effectively link environmental justice with social justice.Breaking new ground, Smith and Pangsapa address how environmental responsibility operates through politics, ethics, culture and the everyday experiences of ctivists, as well as how awareness of environmental and social injustice only leads to responsible actions and strategic change through civic engagement.},

	abstract = {Urban Ecology is the study of ecosystems that include humans living in cities and urbanizing landscapes. It is an emerging, interdisciplinary field that aims to understand how human and ecological processes can coexist in human-dominated systems and help societies with their efforts to become more sustainable. It has deep roots in many disciplines including sociology, geography, urban planning, landscape architecture, engineering, economics, anthropology, climatology, public health, and ecology. Because of its interdisciplinary nature and unique focus on humans and natural systems, the term "urban ecology" has been used variously to describe the study of humans in cities, of nature in cities, and of the coupled relationships between humans and nature. Each of these research areas is contributing to our understanding of urban ecosystems and each must be understood to fully grasp the science of Urban Ecology. Therefore, in Urban Ecology: An International Perspective on the Interaction Between Humans and Nature, we introduce students and practitioners of urban ecology to its roots, bases, and prospects by way of a diverse collection of historical and modern foundational readings. The editors are urban ecologists from the United States, Italy, and Germany who together view these readings as a fair representation of the importance of both natural and social sciences to Urban Ecology. 
This book presents important papers in the field of Urban Ecology that both set the foundations for the discipline and to illustrate modern approaches, from a variety of perspectives and regions of the world. The editors do this by reprinting important publications, filling gaps in the published literature with a few targeted original works, and translating several key works originally published in German. The aim of this collection is to provide students, practitioners, and professionals with a rich background in some of the core facets of Urban Ecology.

Author, Ian Newton, reveals the extraordinary adaptability of birds to the variable and changing conditions across the globe, including current climate change. This adventurous book places emphasis on ecological aspects, which have received only scant attention in previous publications. Overall, the book provides the most thorough and in-depth appraisal of current information available, with abundant tables, maps and diagrams, and many new insights. Written in a clear and readable style, this book appeals not only to migration researchers in the field and Ornithologists, but to anyone with an interest in this fascinating subject.  * Hot ecological aspects include: various types of bird movements, including dispersal and nomadism, and how they relate to food supplies and other external conditions * Contains numerous tables, maps and diagrams, a glossary, and a bibliography of more than 2,700 references* Written by an active researcher with a distinguished career in avian ecology, including migration research},

The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture surveys the dynamic environmental forces that have shaped human culture in the region--and the ways humans have shaped their environment. Articles examine how the South's ecology, physiography, and climate have influenced southerners--not only as a daily fact of life but also as a metaphor for understanding culture and identity.



This volume includes ninety-eight essays that explore--both broadly and specifically--elements of the southern environment. Thematic overviews address subjects such as plants, animals, energy use and development, and natural disasters. Shorter topical entries feature familiar species such as the alligator, the ivory-billed woodpecker, kudzu, and the mockingbird.

	abstract = {The increasing complexity of societal change in response to the new global economy requires an enhanced capacity for scientific assessment and monitoring, particularly of critical infrastructure such as ports and harbors. Public pressure for decision transparency in government and corporations drives the need for a new framework for thinking about globalization and the prioritization of social and corporate values that reaches beyond the realms of economics, world trade, and corporate management to include environmental protection and social goals. Establishing, maintaining, and enhancing a sense of security and vulnerability in areas around critical infrastructure will require: 1. Matching human demands with available resources. 2. Recognizing threats, including environmental security threats and infrastructure vulnerabilities. 3. Identifying the range of available options for preventing and minimizing natural disasters, technological failures, and terror actions. This book emphasizes beliefs that the convergence of seemingly disparate viewpoints and often uncertain and limited information is possible only by using one or more available risk assessment methodologies and decision-making tools such as risk assessment and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).},

	abstract = {In response to the zebra mussel invasion, Transport Canada implemented voluntary regulations requiring flushing for vessels entering the Great Lakes with tanks filled with foreign freshwater ballast. The policy was made mandatory in 1993 by the U.S. Coast Guard, although it applies to less than 10 per cent of ships that enter.                 Recognizing that these unregulated vessels posed an invasion risk, in 2000 the Shipping Federation of Canada implemented a Code of Best Practices to reduce the risk of uploading or transferring new invaders to the lakes. These procedures included not loading ballast at night or in very shallow or turbid water, not loading in ports known to support invasive or harmful species, and flushing of ballast tanks whenever possible.                 Working with the support of the ship industry, we conducted experiments aboard six vessels travelling between Great Lakes and European ports. These experiments involved examination of ballast water composition in control (non-flushed) and experimental (flushed) tanks before the ships left and after they arrived at their destination ports. Three different types of experiments produced the same results: ballast tank flushing could be highly effective in reducing the abundance of invertebrate animals. In fact, densities of live, freshwater animals in exchanged ballast water were always below the limit required of future technology to meet global ballast water effluent standards as proposed by the International Maritime Organization.},

	abstract = {The longleaf pine ecosystem, once one of the most extensive ecosystems in North America, is now among the most threatened. Over the past few centuries, land clearing, logging, fire suppression, and the encroachment of more aggressive plants have led to an overwhelming decrease in the ecosystem's size, to approximately 2.2\% of its original coverage. Despite this devastation, the range of the longleaf still extends from Virginia to Texas. Through the combined efforts of organizations such as the USDA Forest Service, the Longleaf Alliance, and the Nature Conservancy, extensive programs to conserve, restore, and manage the ecosystem are currently underway. 
The longleaf pine ecosystem is valued not only for its aesthetic appeal, but also for its outstanding biodiversity, habitat value, and for the quality of the longleaf pine lumber. It has a natural resistance to fire and insects, and supports more than thirty threatened or endangered plant and animal species, including the red-cockaded woodpecker and the gopher tortoise.
The Longleaf Pine Ecosystem unites a wealth of current information on the ecology, silviculture, and restoration of this ecosystem. The book also includes a discussion of the significant historical, social, and political aspects of ecosystem management, making it a valuable resource for students, land managers, ecologists, private landowners, government agencies, consultants, and the forest products industry.

	abstract = {Sheltered coastal areas, such as those along bays and estuaries, experience land loss from erosion and sea level rise much like ocean beaches. Owners of property along sheltered coasts often reinforce their shoreline with bulkheads and other structures to prevent erosion. However, this construction alters the coastal ecosystem, causing changes that threaten landscapes, public access, recreational opportunities, natural habitats, and fish populations. At the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology, this report examines the impacts of shoreline management on sheltered coasts. The report calls for a regional management approach that considers the environmental impacts that could accumulate if hard structures are permitted on a site by site basis. In addition the report recommends changing the current permitting system to remove the default preference for bulkheads and similar structures and allow more flexibility to encourage use of more ecologically beneficial erosion-control methods, such as planting of marshes.
Like ocean beaches, sheltered coastal areas experience land loss from erosion and sea level rise. In response, property owners often install hard structures such as bulkheads as a way to prevent further erosion, but these structures cause changes in the coastal environment that alter landscapes, reduce public access and recreational opportunities, diminish natural habitats, and harm species that depend on these habitats for shelter and food.
Mitigating Shore Erosion Along Sheltered Coasts recommends coastal planning efforts and permitting policies to encourage landowners to use erosion control alternatives that help retain the natural features of coastal shorelines.},

	abstract = {We quantified somatic growth, development, and emergence of the midge Chironomus riparius on experimental diets (oats, Spirulina, and Tetraphyll®) covering gradients in food quality (differing polyunsaturated fatty acids) and quantity (0.1-5.4 mg C.day{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}). Additionally, similar incubations without food additions were made using a foodpoor sediment containing peat and the green alga Scenedesmus obliquus. Larval and adult size was affected by both food quantity and quality and increased some three to four times across the food concentration gradients. Adult emergence, however, was affected only by food quantity. A type 3 response model showed that a saturation level was reached for the oats treatment at 2.7 mg C.day{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum} (or 3.9 µmg ω3 and 120 µmg ω6 polyunsaturated fatty acids.day{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}), indicating that the quality of oats constrained further stimulation of larval growth. In the peat treatment, larval growth was very low, no adults emerged, and no larvae even made it to the pupa stage. Fatty acid analysexxs showed that larvae were capable of synthesizing arachidonic acid via γ-linolenic acid by Δ6- and Δ53-desaturase activity using linoleic acid available in food sources. This strongly suggests that C. riparius is not dependent on dietary sources of eicosapentaenoic acid and arachidonic acid and can sustain viable populations even under a low-quality food regimen.

	abstract = {Brazil's unwelcome snail is just one of a burgeoning breed of pests and pathogens that have broken free of their native habitats around the world. Biologists somewhat quaintly call them exotic species. The rest of the world knows them for what they are: bioinvaders. They come in all guises, from trifling microbes to towering trees, from the mosquito to the mongoose. What they share is a penchant for stealth, spiriting around the planet on the wings of migratory birds, nestled in the threads of clothing or swimming in the human bloodstream. Scores of bioinvaders are deliberately set loose by farmers or eggheads trying to outsmart nature (importing snakes to chase rats), gardeners with exotic tastes (knotweed) or entrepreneurs too clever by half (seeking the perfect escargot). Bioinvaders are also ferocious competitors; free from the predators of their homelands, they prosper on virgin territory, monopolizing food supply and reproducing at a rate that would make rabbits blanch. Once lodged in a new land, the intruding species may never go away, forcing public authorities to battle them again and again with earthmoving equipment, fire and poison--a job as futile as Sisyphus'.              Any pest, domestic or foreign, can be a nuisance, spoiling the flower patch or buzzing about the ears. But bioinvaders are especially dangerous. Some wipe out harvests, choke waterways and desiccate the landscape, inviting wildfires. A deadly few microbes cause pandemics, like mad-cow disease and AIDS. Even when they aren't an outright menace, exotic plants, animals and pathogens impoverish nature by crowding out a whole suite of homegrown species or creating mongrel hybrids through interbreeding. An increasing number of scientists now agree that bioinvasion is the most immediate--and surely the fastest-growing--threat to plant and animal life on the planet after deforestation and breakneck development. (Of course, global climate change may eventually trump all other dangers, but in part because invasive species are likely to run rampant in a warming world.) "Once you get a nonnative plant or animal species in the system, then it's very difficult to get the habitat back to where it was," says Mark Spencer, an expert on invasive species at the Natural History Museum in London. "We are at an ecological tipping point."              In the United States alone some 50,000 bioinvaders cause an estimated \$120 billion in damages to harvests, trees and fisheries every year, according to [David Pimentel]. Throw in India, the United Kingdom, Australia, South Africa and Brazil, and the cost nearly doubles, to \$228 billion. Globally, says Pimentel, bioinvasion's toll on the economy and the environment--accounting for damage to watersheds, soil degradation and extinction of wildlife--may be a staggering \$1.4 trillion a year. And if the majority of experts are right, the cost of bioinvasion is only going to get worse.},

	abstract = {Dans le cadre de ce doctorat, nous avons étudié la prise en charge de complexes du Cd neutres et lipophiles (Cd(DDC)20, Cd(XANT)20 et Cd(Ox)20; DDC = diéthyl-dithiocarbamate, XANT = éthyl-xanthate et Ox = 8-hydroxyquinoline), dans une gamme de pH représentative des eaux de surface naturelles (entre 5,5 et 7), en présence ou non de substances humiques dissoutes (acides humiques, acides fulviques et matière organique naturelle non fractionnée), le tout par des algues vertes unicellulaires d'eaux douces (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata et Chlorella pyrenoidosa). La prise en charge de tels complexes neutres représente une exception au modèle du ligand biotique (ou BLM) puisqu'ils sont beaucoup plus bioaccumulés (par diffusion passive) que le métal libre seul (par des transporteurs à la surface des membranes biologiques). En outre, il n'existe pas de consensus dans la littérature à propos des effets des substances humiques sur la prise en charge (augmentation, aucun effet, diminution) des métaux libres par des organismes aquatiques. Quant aux effets des substances humiques sur la bioaccumulation des complexes neutres, les recherches sont quasi inexistantes. Cette étude visait donc à combler ce manque.Nos travaux démontrent que la bioaccumulation des complexes neutres Cd(L)20 (L = DDC, XANT ou Ox) est plus élevée que celle du Cd2+ seul, quelque soit le pH et l'espèce algale considérée; il s'agit donc d'un phénomène général. Cependant, cette augmentation est nettement plus limitée à pH 5,5 que 7, le pH influençant probablement la perméabilité membranaire des algues. L'ajout de substances humiques (SH) diminue la prise en charge à l'état stationnaire des complexes Cd(L)20 à pH 7 quelle que soit l'espèce algale. L'association entre les acides humiques (AH) et les complexes Cd(L)20, dans la solution d'exposition, explique en partie cette diminution. Cette association constitue le premier effet des SH ; elle découle de la formation de complexes ternaires impliquant le Cd, les SH et le ligand L. A pH 5,5 la prise en charge à l'état stationnaire n'est pas modifiée en présence des SH voire, dans certains cas, elle est augmentée et ce malgré l'association entre les AH et les complexes Cd(L)20. Il s'agit ici d'un second effet des SH, à savoir leur action de perméabiliser les membranes biologiques vis à vis de solutés neutres et lipophiles. L'insertion des AH dans les membranes biologiques est un des phénomènes qui peut expliquer ces résultats. En ce qui concerne la constante d'internalisation des complexes Cd(L)20, elle est le plus souvent augmentée en présence des SH et ce aux deux pH, mais les explications font appel à plusieurs phénomènes simultanés (fluidité de la membrane, insertion des AH dans la membrane, perméabilisation de la membrane due à l'excès de ligand).D'un point de vue général, la prise en charge de complexes neutres Cd(L)20 est influencée par: l'espèce algale, le pH, le coefficient de partage octanol-eau des complexes Cd(L)20, la présence de SH (association Cd(L)20 + SH ; insertion des SH dans la membrane cellulaire), et par l'excès de ligand organique L en solution (effet perméabilisant les membranes biologiques ).Enfin, concernant l'influence des SH sur la bioaccumulation de complexes neutres, nos résultats ont démontré des effets duaux : i) en liant les complexes neutres à pH 7 (la nouvelle molécule est alors non biodisponible) et ii) en augmentant la perméabilité membranaire, surtout à pH acide, probablement par insertion dans la membrane biologique. Suivant la fraction des SH et l'espèce algale des différences apparaissent.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerAs part of this PhD, we studied the uptake of neutral and lipophilic Cd complexes (Cd(DDC)20, Cd(XANT)20 and Cd(Ox)20; DDC = diethyl-dithiocarbamate, XANT = ethyl- xanthate and Ox = 8-hydroxyquinoline), in a pH range representative of natural surface waters (between 5.5 and 7), with or without the presence of dissolved humic substances (humic acids, fulvic acids and unfractionated natural organic matter) , all by unicellular green freshwater algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata and Chlorella pyrenoidosa). The uptake of such neutral complexes represents an exception to the biotic ligand model (or BLM) since they are much more bioaccumulated (by passive diffusion) than free metal alone (by transporters on the surface of biological membranes). Furthermore, there is no consensus in the literature about the effects of humic substances on the uptake (increase, no effect, decrease) of free metals by aquatic organisms. As for the effects of humic substances on the bioaccumulation of neutral complexes, research is almost non-existent. This study therefore aimed to fill this gap.Our work demonstrates that the bioaccumulation of neutral Cd(L)20 complexes (L = DDC, XANT or Ox) is higher than that of Cd2+ alone, whatever the pH and the algal species considered; it is therefore a general phenomenon. However, this increase is clearly more limited at pH 5.5 than 7, the pH probably influencing the membrane permeability of the algae. The addition of humic substances (SH) decreases the steady-state uptake of Cd(L)20 complexes at pH 7 regardless of the algal species. The association between humic acids (HA) and Cd(L)20 complexes in the exposure solution partly explains this decrease. This association constitutes the first effect of HS; it arises from the formation of ternary complexes involving Cd, the SHs and the L ligand. increased despite the association between HA and Cd(L)20 complexes. This is a second effect of HS, namely their action of permeabilizing biological membranes with respect to neutral and lipophilic solutes. The insertion of HAs into biological membranes is one of the phenomena which may explain these results. As regards the internalization constant of Cd(L)20 complexes, it is most often increased in the presence of SH and at both pHs, but the explanations call on several simultaneous phenomena (fluidity of the membrane, insertion of AH in the membrane, membrane permeabilization due to excess ligand).From a general point of view, the uptake of neutral Cd(L)20 complexes is influenced by: the algal species, the pH, the octanol-water partition coefficient of the Cd(L)20 complexes, the presence of SH (association Cd(L)20 + SH; insertion of SH into the cell membrane), and by the excess of organic ligand L in solution (permeabilizing effect on biological membranes).Finally, concerning the influence of SH on the bioaccumulation of neutral complexes, our results demonstrated dual effects: i) by binding the neutral complexes at pH 7 (the new molecule is then not bioavailable) and ii) by increasing the membrane permeability , especially at acidic pH, probably by insertion into the biological membrane. Depending on the SH fraction and the algal species, differences appear.},

	abstract = {Validation of a two-dimensional hydrothermal stratification model for 14 years for Schoharie Reservoir, N.Y., an impoundment that experiences substantial drawdown, is documented. The model is demonstrated to perform well in simulating the various features of the reservoir's thermal stratification regime in each of the years, including the timing and duration of stratification, the dimensions and temperature of the layers, and the periods of internal wave oscillations in stratified layers. The average root mean square error for temperature predictions for the 14 years is 1.30 °C. The validated model is applied in a probabilistic manner to investigate the impacts of sedimentation on the temperature of the withdrawn water (T{\textasciicircum}sub w{\textasciicircum}) that enters a stream with a salmonid fishery, and features of the stratification regime. The predicted effects of sedimentation include a shift toward higher T{\textasciicircum}sub w{\textasciicircum} values, a shortening of the duration of stratification, and decrease in the depth of the epilimnion in fall. The effects on T{\textasciicircum}sub w{\textasciicircum} are exacerbated for the reservoir because of localized sedimentation adjoining the intake that increasingly limits access to cooler layers.

	abstract = {Municipal effluents are complex mixtures of compounds such as heavy metals, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, and micro-organisms and are released in aquatic ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to verify whether changes in metallothioneins (MT) were associated with the accumulation of labile metals in tissue of freshwater mussels exposed to the dispersion plume of a major municipal effluent. Mussels were placed in experimental cages deployed at sites 1.5 km upstream, 8 km downstream and 12 km downstream of the outfall of a major, primary-treated municipal effluent in the St. Lawrence River (Québec, Canada). Mussels were analysed for MT and labile zinc levels in their gonads, gills and digestive glands. Lipogenic enzyme (isocitrate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase (COX) activities were also measured in gonad and gill tissues. Although MT was induced in all the tissues examined, the results showed that labile zinc levels were significantly reduced in gill and gonad tissues, with an increase observed only at the 12 km downstream site in the digestive gland. COX activity was readily induced in gills and gonads. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was reduced at both downstream sites, but isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was signifcantly induced at the farthest (12 km) site. Analysis of covariance revealed that MT levels in gills were more influenced by COX activity than with distance in the dispersion plume and was negatively correlated with labile zinc levels. In conclusion, MT induction was inversely related to the levels of labile zinc but positively so with the inflammation biomarker COX. Hence, the induction of MT in mussels exposed to the municipal effluent of a large city appears to be associated with either inflammatory processes or as compensation for the loss of labile essential metals. We propose that the simple and complimentary parameters of labile zinc and COX evaluations be used to link MT induction with divalent heavy metal exposure in environmental studies dealing with various type of contaminants in such complex contaminant mixture effluents.},

	abstract = {The sustainable use of biodiversity is one of the three key objectives of the 1992 "Convention on Biological Diversity". To achieve this, sound conservation practice has to be recognized as beneficial and implemented by all who access, or use it - from subsistence farmers to skiers and pharmaceutical bioprospectors. At the same time, indigenous peoples necessarily utilize enormous numbers of plants, fungi, and fish, particularly for foods and medicines. 
This book gathers together a wide range of contributions addressing diverse aspects of front-line human involvement in biodiversity exploitation and conservation. Its scope is broad, the organisms explored ranging from birds, invertebrates and mammals - both terrestrial and aquatic - to crops and medicinal plants. Meanwhile, the issues addressed include land use changes, the importance of gardens, hedges and green lanes, housing developments, hunting, invasive species, local community involvement, sacred groves, socioeconomic factors and trade.
These peer reviewed case studies come from studies in 17 countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and North and South America. Providing a snap-shot of on-going action and state-of-the-art research, rather than a series of necessarily more superficial overviews, this collection will be of particular interest to courses including biodiversity and/or conservation issues, and to advanced students and researchers working in related fields.

	abstract = {La perchaude (Perca flavescens) est une espèce du poisson qui est souvent retrouvée non seulement dans des lacs de référence, mais également dans les lacs contaminés en métaux. Cette espèce de poisson représente ainsi un bon modèle pour étudier la bioaccumulation de métaux in situ. Les objectifs de cette thèse étaient d'examiner la dynamique d'accumulation et d'élimination de métaux (Cd, Cu et Zn) chez la perchaude sur le terrain. Cette dynamique a été suivie suite à des changements brusques du régime d'exposition (c.-à-d., par des études de transplantation) et de façon saisonnière chez les perchaudes indigènes dans leurs lacs d'origine. De plus, la bioréactivité des métaux accumulés a été examinée en suivant l'accumulation des métaux au niveau subcellulaire. On a également examiné l'importance relative de la nourriture et de l'eau ambiante comme sources de Cd pour la perchaude, en utilisant des expériences menées sur le terrain. Un modèle cinétique de bioaccumulation a été alors développé pour examiner l'accumulation de Cd chez les populations de perchaudes indigènes.Afin d'examiner comment les concentrations en métal changeraient chez la perchaude suivant un changement brusque de leur régime d'exposition, des poissons ont été transplantés d'un lac de référence (Lac Opasatica) vers un lac contaminé (Lac Dufault) pour examiner la dynamique de la prise en charge en métal, et du Lac Dufault au Lac Opasatica pour examiner la dynamique d'élimination en métal. Les résultats de ces expériences ont suggéré que la perchaude contrôle ses concentrations internes de Cd, Cu et Zn différemment. Par exemple, les concentrations du Cd ont augmenté dans tous les organes étudiés (les branchies, le tractus gastro-intestinal, le foie et le rein) dans l'expérience de prise en charge, et pendant l'expérience d'élimination, peu de perte de ce métal s'est produite dans le foie et le rein. Par contre, il y avait peu changement des concentrations en Zn chez les poissons transplantés, malgré des concentrations en Zn²⁺ beaucoup plus élevées dans le lac Dufault, suggérant que l'accumulation de ce métal soit fortement régulée par la perchaude. D'autre part, les concentrations en Cu ont augmenté dans le foie des poissons transplantés pendant l'expérience de la prise en charge, et elles ont rapidement diminué pendant l'expérience d'élimination, suggérant que l'élimination accrue soit une stratégie importante employée par la perchaude pour contrôler des concentrations accumulées de ce métal. Un examen des variations saisonnières de Cd et de Cu a indiqué que ces métaux ont changé de manière significative dans le foie pendant une période de quatre mois (de mai à août), mais seulement chez les poissons avec des concentrations hépatiques élevées de ces deux métaux.Au niveau subcellulaire, les résultats des expériences de transplantation ont indiqué que la majorité du Cd et du Cu accumulés dans le foie était associée à la fraction des protéines stables à la chaleur (c.-à-d., contenant de la métallothionéine), suggérant qu'une grande partie du Cd et du Cu bioaccumulés ait été détoxiquée. Cependant, il y avait une certaine accumulation de ces métaux dans les fractions « potentiellement sensibles » aux métaux (des organelles et des protéines dénaturées à la chaleur), suggérant que la désintoxication ait été inachevée.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerPerch (Perca flavescens) is a fish species that is often found not only in reference lakes, but also in lakes contaminated with metals. This species of fish thus represents a good model for studying the bioaccumulation of metals in situ. The objectives of this thesis were to examine the dynamics of accumulation and elimination of metals (Cd, Cu and Zn) in yellow perch in the field. These dynamics have been tracked following abrupt changes in exposure regime (ie, by transplantation studies) and seasonally in native yellow perch in their natal lakes. In addition, the bioreactivity of accumulated metals was examined by following the accumulation of metals at the subcellular level. The relative importance of food and ambient water as sources of Cd for yellow perch was also investigated using field experiments. A kinetic bioaccumulation model was then developed to examine Cd accumulation in native yellow perch populations.To examine how metal concentrations would change in yellow perch following an abrupt change in their exposure regime, fish were transplanted from a reference lake (Lac Opasatica) to a contaminated lake (Lac Dufault) to examine the dynamics of metal uptake, and from Lac Dufault to Lac Opasatica to examine the dynamics of metal removal. The results of these experiments suggested that yellow perch control their internal concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn differently. For example, Cd concentrations increased in all organs studied (gills, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney) in the pick-up experiment, and during the elimination experiment, few loss of this metal occurred in the liver and kidney. On the other hand, there was little change in Zn concentrations in transplanted fish, despite much higher Zn²⁺ concentrations in Lac Dufault, suggesting that the accumulation of this metal is strongly regulated by yellow perch. On the other hand, Cu concentrations increased in the liver of transplanted fish during the pick-up experiment, and they rapidly decreased during the removal experiment, suggesting that increased removal is an important strategy. employed by yellow perch to control accumulated concentrations of this metal. A review of seasonal variations in Cd and Cu indicated that these metals changed significantly in the liver over a four-month period (May to August), but only in fish with elevated liver concentrations of these two metals. .At the subcellular level, the results of the transplantation experiments indicated that the majority of the Cd and Cu accumulated in the liver was associated with the fraction of heat-stable proteins (i.e., containing metallothionein), suggesting that much of the bioaccumulated Cd and Cu has been detoxified. However, there was some accumulation of these metals in the "potentially metal-sensitive" fractions (organelles and heat-denatured proteins), suggesting that detoxification was incomplete.},

	abstract = {Growth and survivorship of larval yellow perch (Perca flavescens) have been examined in many systems but can conclusions from well-studied perch populations in smaller lakes be applied to populations in meso-oceanic systems like Lake Michigan, USA? Laboratory experiments were conducted with yellow perch (hatch to 35 mm total length) to develop an empirical selectivity function based on Chesson's α to describe larval diet as a function of changes in prey community composition. This function was used in an individual-based foraging and growth model (IBM) to describe changes in foraging decisions resulting from changes in prey composition between different systems. Larval perch made three selective transitions during ontogeny. Initial positive selection for rotifers and the relative selectivity for cladocerans vs. copepods in late-stage larvae were both dependent on prey composition. Larvae exposed to prey assemblages differing only in composition had different diets. The empirically based IBM accurately predicted these dietary differences and resulting differences in larval growth and likelihood of starvation between systems at equal prey density. The importance of feeding behavior to larval survival will differ between Lake Michigan and smaller lakes, and these results are important for comparisons of recruitment dynamics between large and small systems.

	abstract = {Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in Lake Michigan have experienced sustained recruitment failure since 1990 as a result of increased mortality during the pelagic larval phase. Increased mortality of larval yellow perch has been tied indirectly to increased alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) predation, but effects of predation on larval survival variability must be better understood. We compared the relative importance of predation by alewife and two other fish predators to larval survival in laboratory experiments and developed an individual-based predation model (IBM) to examine patterns in size-dependent predation vulnerability. Simulations exposing larval perch to predation by all predators suggest that larval mortality resulting from alewife predation is more size-dependent than mortality resulting from the other two predators, and the range of sizes vulnerable to alewife is smaller. Alewife predation may not be an important mortality source for larval yellow perch in Lake Michigan at present because of the narrow range of vulnerable sizes and low densities of larval perch in the open lake. Predation is more likely to be important in smaller, more productive systems where other predators are abundant. Modeling results also indicate IBM analysis of date of hatch distributions of surviving larvae is a valuable tool for identifying factors most important to larval survival. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {From a 3-year study of 21 northern Ontario lakes, models were developed to determine the duration of ice cover, predict the timing of spring stratification, and predict the end-of-season mixing depth. The model to determine lake freeze and thaw dates was based on the daily variability of water temperature measured with a data logger suspended 1 and 2 m below the surface. The model to predict the duration of time (days) from lake thaw to lake stratification was developed using the mean May air temperature (degrees Celsius), dissolved organic carbon, and lake surface area (r{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} = 0.79). The end-of-season mixing depth was best predicted using days to stratification and dissolved organic-carbon concentration (r{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} = 0.72). By applying a simple climate change scenario model, we were able to show that increased air temperature, rather than increased water clarity, was the most important factor affecting the timing of stratification. In contrast, lake clarity was the most important factor affecting end-of-season mixing depth in small Shield lakes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Modern food web studies are typically conducted from a trophic dynamic perspective that focuses on combined roles of top-down and bottom-up forces in regulating food web structure. Recognition of spatial food web subsidies in diverse ecosystems highlights the importance of energy flow as a foundation for understanding trophic dynamics. Here, we consider how different energy flow configurations might affect trophic dynamics in north-temperate lakes. A literature review revealed that littoral piscivores exert top-down control on prey fishes. In contrast, analysis of littoral predator diets indicated extensive omnivory and heavy reliance on zoobenthic prey. We explored this uncoupling between trophic dynamics (piscivores regulate prey fish) and energy flow (zoobenthos in piscivore diets) using a biomass dynamic model. This model compared top-down impacts of a piscivore on prey fishes under two scenarios: consumption of prey fish only and consumption of prey fish plus zoobenthos. The model predicted that elimination of zoobenthivory leads to a 50\% reduction in piscivore standing stock and concomitant 2.5-fold increase in prey fish abundance (i.e., zoobenthivory plays a key role in mediating pelagic top-down control). These results highlight the role of benthic-pelagic linkages in regulating trophic dynamics and underscore the value of whole-ecosystem approaches to the study of food webs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Metal contamination can disrupt trophic links in food webs by altering the taxonomic composition and size structure of benthic macroinvertebrate communities. Benthic macroinvertebrates and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) were collected from six lakes along a gradient of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) contamination in Quebec, Canada. The two most contaminated lakes had significantly lower densities of several benthic macroinvertebrate taxa and significantly lower Shannon's index than less contaminated lakes. The stomach contents of perch from the most contaminated lakes were less diverse, with a greater reliance on chironomids and (or) zooplankton than perch from other study lakes. The size of prey in perch from the most contaminated lakes did not increase with age and the mean prey size was smaller than in other, less contaminated lakes. Perch from lakes with medium to low levels of contamination weighed significantly more than perch from lakes with high levels of contamination. This reduction in growth is attributed to the increased costs of foraging on a simplified prey base in metal-contaminated systems. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {In 2002, the Swedish Metal Information Task Force (MITF) engaged the Environmental Research Group (MFG) to update previous monographs on copper, zinc and major alloying metals (such as chromium, nickel and molybdenum) in society and in the environment. This book presents new results on metal fluxes from society to the environment, on metal speciation in water, soil and sediment, and its interpretation in terms of mobility, biological uptake and toxicity. The scientific fundamentals of new approaches, like the Acid Volatile Sulphide (AVS) concept to predict metal bioavailability in sediments, and the Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) to calculate the toxicity of metals to aquatic organisms, are critically evaluated, with a focus on copper, nickel, zinc, and, in part, chromium. 
Recent scientific advances now offer an improved understanding of the mechanisms and factors controlling the intricate behaviour of trace metals, their interactions, uptake and effect in natural systems. Traditional risk assessment methods usually built on quite crude toxicity tests done in unrealistic "laboratory waters", and did not consider natural conditions. In contrast, modern approaches now increasingly involve the full utilisation of site-specific factors, which are decisive for the formation of bioavailable and toxic metal forms.
Audience
This book provides excellent guidance to both scientists focusing on the assessment of the ecological risk of metals, and to authorities, decision makers in industry, educational staff and the interested public concerned with the occurrence and fate of trace metals.Presents new results and approaches for assessment of metals in society and the environment},

It begins with a categorization of taxa which inhabit flowing water habitats followed by information on their evolutionary and physical diversity and biogeography. Within the framework of ecology, the authors discuss the composition of river turtle communities in different types of lotic habitats and regions, population dynamics, movements, reproductive characteristics and behavior, predators, and feeding relationships. In a conservation and management section, the authors identify and evaluate the nature and intensity of factors which threaten river turtle survival--almost all of which involve direct human exploitation or indirect effects of human induced habitat alteration and degradation. They then list and evaluate the various schemes which have been proposed or employed to halt declines and restore populations, and make recommendations for future management plans for specific species and regions. In closing, they state their viewpoint concerning future research directions and priorities, and an evaluation of future prospects for survival of the world's river turtle species.},

	abstract = {Le cycle géochimique de l'argent a été fortement perturbé par les activités humaines, mais les effets écotoxicologiques de cette mobilisation sont peu connus. On peut s'attendre à ce que les effets de l'argent sur les organismes aquatiques dépendent entre autres de sa concentration dans le milieu et de sa spéciation, c'est-à-dire de sa répartition entre différentes formes chimiques. Ce projet visait à évaluer la disponibilité des formes organiques de ce métal pour la prise en charge par deux algues d'eau douce, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii et Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. Ces dernières étaient exposées en laboratoire à des systèmes contenant un radio-isotope de l'argent (l1OrnAg) en présence de matière organique dissoute naturelle (1{\textbackslash}10D; acides humiques isolés de la rivière Suwannee, GA-FL, E.U.A. (SRHA)). Pour réaliser ces expériences nous avons d'abord mis au point une technique d'échange ionique (TEl) aflll de mesurer la concentration d'argent libre (Ag+) dans les milieux d'exposition en présence ou en absence de la MOD. La sélectivité de la TEl pour l'ion libre de l'argent, l'Ag+, a été testée avec un ligand inorganique, le CC dont les constantes de complexation avec l'argent sont connues et fiables. Nous avons augmenté la concentration en chlorures pour une concentration fixe d'Ag totale. Au fur et à mesure que les concentrations des chloro-complexes (AgClo; AgCk1 ) augmentaient dans le milieu, la concentration en Ag+ diminuait. Les résultats expérimentaux furent comparés avec les prédictions calculées par un modèle d'équilibres chimiques MINEQL+ (v.4.5). À fortes concentrations de chlorure, les chloro-complexes neutres (AgC]O) contribuent à la fraction d'Ag+ dans le dosage de l'ion libre avec la TEL Il pourrait donc y avoir formation d'un complexe ternaire, résine-Ag-Cl.Nous avons ensuite mesuré la concentration d'Ag+ en présence d'acides humiques de la rivière Suwannee; ces résultats indiquent que la MOD naturelle complexe fortement l'argent. La courbe de titrage établie à partir de ces résultats indique l'existence d'au moins deux types de sites (fort et faible) de complexation de l'argent au sein des molécules d'acides humiques. Partant de ces résultats, nous avons préparé des milieux d'exposition contenant des concentrations variables de l'ion Ag+, sans ou avec les acides humiques. Ces milieux ont été utilisés pour étudier la prise en charge (uptake) de l'argent par les deux algues: C. reinhardtii et P. subcapitata. Pour une concentration en Ag+ libre donnée, et pour un temps d'exposition fixe, les deux algues accumulent davantage d'argent en présence de la MOD qu'en milieu inorganique, une tendance qui va à l'encontre des prédictions du Modèle du Ligand Biotique «{\textless}Biotic Ligand Modeb{\textgreater} (BLM) ou Modèle de l'Ion Libre (MIL)). Ces derniers prédisent que la prise en charge est proportionnelle à la concentration en Ag+, en absence ou en présence d'un complexe (MOD), pourvu que la concentration en Ag+ soit identique dans les deux milieux. Cette prise en charge accrue ne serait pas attribuable à un taux d'approvisionnement en Ag plus élevé en présence de SRHA mais plutôt à un effet direct de la MOD naturelle sur les algues. Nous avons considéré trois mécanismes possibles pour expliquer ces résultats: (1) la concentration en Ag+ est peut-être sousestimée dans les milieux d'exposition; (2) la mesure opérationnelle d'Ag intracellulaire comprend aussi une contribution d'un complexe ternaire (MOD-Ag-algue) adsorbé à la surface algale; (3) l'adsorption de MOD à la surface algale pourrait modifier la charge de surface et/ou entraîner au changement au niveau du fonctionnement des transporteurs membranaires, ce qui conduirait à une vitesse de transport plus élevée de leur part. C'est ce dernier mécanisme qui nous semble le plus plausible.A l'échelle environnementale, la forte affinité de la MOD naturelle pour l'Ag et la faible concentration en Ag dissous font que la concentration en Ag+ dans le milieu est minime. D'après nos résultats, à ces concentrations environnementales, la différence de prise en charge (sans/avec MOD) dans le milieu est plutôt faible. On peut donc conclure que l'application du MIL est relativement bonne.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerThe geochemical cycle of silver has been strongly disturbed by human activities, but the ecotoxicological effects of this mobilization are little known. The effects of silver on aquatic organisms can be expected to depend, among other things, on its concentration in the environment and on its speciation, that is to say on its distribution between different chemical forms. This project aimed to assess the availability of organic forms of this metal for uptake by two freshwater algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. The latter were exposed in the laboratory to systems containing a radioisotope of silver (l1OrnAg) in the presence of natural dissolved organic matter (1{\textbackslash}10D; humic acids isolated from the Suwannee River, GA-FL, USA (SRHA)) .To carry out these experiments, we first developed an ion exchange technique (TEl) to measure the concentration of free silver (Ag+) in the exposure media in the presence or absence of DOM. The selectivity of TE1 for the free silver ion, Ag+, was tested with an inorganic ligand, CC, whose complexation constants with silver are known and reliable. We increased the chloride concentration for a fixed concentration of total Ag. As the concentrations of chloro-complexes (AgClo; AgCk1 ) increased in the medium, the concentration of Ag+ decreased. The experimental results were compared with the predictions calculated by a chemical equilibrium model MINEQL+ (v.4.5). At high chloride concentrations, neutral chloro-complexes (AgC]O) contribute to the fraction of Ag+ in the free ion assay with LET. There could therefore be formation of a ternary complex, resin-Ag- Cl.We then measured the concentration of Ag+ in the presence of humic acids from the Suwannee River; these results indicate that natural MOD strongly complexes silver. The titration curve established from these results indicates the existence of at least two types of sites (strong and weak) of silver complexation within the molecules of humic acids. Based on these results, we prepared exposure media containing varying concentrations of the Ag+ ion, with or without humic acids. These media were used to study silver uptake by two algae: C. reinhardtii and P. subcapitata. For a given free Ag+ concentration, and for a fixed exposure time, the two algae accumulate more silver in the presence of DOM than in an inorganic medium, a trend that goes against the predictions of the Ligand Model Biotic “{\textless}Biotic Ligand Modeb{\textgreater} (BLM) or Free Ion Model (MIL)). The latter predict that the uptake is proportional to the concentration of Ag+, in the absence or presence of a complex (MOD), provided that the concentration of Ag+ is identical in the two media. This increased uptake would not be attributable to a higher Ag supply rate in the presence of SRHA but rather to a direct effect of the natural DOM on the algae. We considered three possible mechanisms to explain these results: (1) the Ag+ concentration may be underestimated in the exposure media; (2) the operational measurement of intracellular Ag also includes a contribution from a ternary complex (MOD-Ag-algae) adsorbed on the algal surface; (3) the adsorption of MOD to the algal surface could modify the surface charge and/or lead to a change in the functioning of membrane transporters, which would lead to a higher transport rate on their part. It is this last mechanism which seems to us the most plausible.On an environmental scale, the high affinity of natural DOM for Ag and the low concentration of dissolved Ag mean that the concentration of Ag+ in the medium is minimal. According to our results, at these environmental concentrations, the difference in uptake (without/with MOD) in the medium is rather small. It can therefore be concluded that the application of the MIL is relatively good.},

	abstract = {We assessed the colonization risk of invertebrate nonindigenous species (NIS) in ballast water being brought into Canada's Pacific coast by indirect and direct methods. Initially we mapped the locations in the northern Pacific Ocean where ships coming into Vancouver Harbour had performed mid-ocean exchange (MOE). Exchange transects (the distance between the start and end positions for the onset and end of MOE) were on average about 400 km long. Samples were also taken from ballast tanks after filling at a northwestern Pacific port and then again after MOE in the mid-Pacific. Invertebrate communities were different pre- and post-MOE, but some coastal organisms were still present after flushing. In addition, samples were obtained from ballast tanks aboard ships in Vancouver Harbour. In "low" salinity samples ({\textless}25[per thousand]), 13 different taxa were found, and 52 taxa were found in "high" salinity samples ({\textgreater}25[per thousand]). Risks could be reduced if MOE was performed in the southerly subtropical domain, south of the subarctic domain and transition zone in the mid-Pacific, or well offshore for north-south shipping routes. For voyages on the west coast of North America, colonization risk of invertebrate NIS is likely higher for ballast water from harbours already colonized by NIS. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

On the one hand, vigilance must be central to a new Georgics. Enforceable standards for food safety, food quality, environmental protection, worker health and safety, sanitary and phytosanitary requirements, animal welfare, and appellations must be addressed. On the other hand, a new Georgics must increase the range of persons who have voice in the democratic governance of a new global agrifood system.

The present paper examines this issue as it applies to Vancouver Harbour and Juan de Fuca Strait, British Columbia, and the adjacent U.S. waters. The objective is to determine whether potential mechanisms exist to transport viable organisms that might be present in discharged ballast water to favourable reproductive habitats within British Columbian coastal waters. The study applied three-dimensional harmonic finite element models to generate representative tidal, atmospheric, and density-driven flow fields. Particle-tracking techniques were used to simulate representative trajectories of passive and active ballast water organisms discharged at existing deballasting sites. It was determined that the safest deballasting sites are off the west coast. Under normal conditions, organisms move southward (summer) or northward (winter) in the Shelf Break Current and only under strong eastward or northward winds are they transported to the Washington or Vancouver Island shorelines.

	abstract = {The River We Have Wrought is a landmark history of the upper Mississippi, from early European exploration through the completion of a navigable channel and a system of locks and dams in the mid-twentieth century. One of the world’s largest and most powerful rivers, the Mississippi became the waterway we know today after massive engineering efforts. Previously, it was often shallow and full of sandbars, snags, and mile-long rapids. Shipping goods and people from St. Louis to St. Paul was arduous and expensive on the natural river, so the farmers and merchants of the region demanded that the federal government transform the upper Mississippi. As a result, in 1930 Congress authorized a system of locks and dams that has revolutionized shipping and, by extension, life in the Midwest. Anfinson explores the origins of navigation improvements and traces the physical design of the river to the grain empire’s feud with railroads and to the politics of port cities. He also reveals how the conservation movement rose to challenge navigation’s supremacy, questioning the impact of the locks and dams on the ecology of the river. At a time when the role of such public works and their impact on the environment is being intensely debated, The River We Have Wrought is an essential examination of how politics has shaped the landscapes of the Upper Midwest and how taming the river has affected economic sustainability, river ecology, and biological diversity.},

	abstract = {Conservation medicine is an emerging discipline, focussing on the intersection of ecosystem health, animal health, and human health. Work in the biomedical and veterinary sciences is now being folded into conservation biology; to explore the connections between animal and human health; trace the environmental sources of pathogens and pollutants; develop an understanding of the ecological causes of changes in human and animal health; and understand the consequences of diseases to populations and ecological communities. Conservation Medicine defines this new discipline. It examines ecological health issues from various standpoints, including the emergence and resurgence of infectious disease agents; the increasing impacts of toxic chemicals and hazardous substances; and the health implications of habitat fragmentation and degradation and loss of biodiversity. It will provide a framework to examine the connections between the health of the planet and the health of all species and challenge practitioners and students in the health sciences and natural sciences to think about new, collaborative ways to address ecological health concerns.},

They cost more than \$100 billion per year in crop and timber losses plus the expense of herbicides and pesticides. And this figure does not include the costs of invasions in less intensively managed ecosystems such as wetlands. 

Nonindigenous Plants and Plant Pests examines this growing problem and offers recommendations for enhancing the science base in this field, improving our detection of potential invaders, and refining our ability to predict their impact.
The book analyzes the factors that shape an invader's progress through four stages: arriving through one of many possible ports of entry, reaching a threshold of survival, thriving through proliferation and geographic spread, and ultimate impact on the organism's new environment. The book also reviews approaches to predicting whether a species will become an invader as well as the more complex challenge of predicting and measuring its impact on the environment, a process involving value judgments and risk assessment.
This detailed analysis will be of interest to policymakers, plant scientists, agricultural producers, environmentalists, and public agencies concerned with invasive plant and plant pest species.},

	abstract = {It was an ambitious idea: a homegrown national magazine covering absolutely everything about the Canadian outdoors. And this at a time when U.S. magazines dominated the newsstands even more so than today. So debuted Outdoor Canada in November 1972, promising readers a Canadian take on fishing, hunting, conservation, hiking, camping, boating, skiing, photography, parks, wildlife and more. That first issue, for example, carried a piece on Ontario steelheading by veteran outdoors scribe John Power, a look at the Yukon's new Kluane National Park and a tale about Sir Edmund Hillary canoeing through the wilds of Quebec. Also featured were moose recipes and book reviews alongside artides on cross-country skiing, winter survival, snowmobiling, motorhomes and boating. While Outdoor Canada has since refined its focus to concentrate on fishing, hunting and conservation, the magazine's original commitment to a uniquely Canadian perspective lives on.


Thanks to PCB, DDT and mirex contamination in the Great Lakes, along with overfishing down East, things didn't look good for Canada's salmon 25 years ago. "The future of the species is uncertain at its present rate of despoliation," Ken Winchester concluded in his story, "The state of salmon." Today, DDT has long been banned and most, if not all, PCB production in North America stopped in 1977. But even though much has been done to clean up the lakes--to date, Ontario alone has invested more than \$350 million--provincial and state governments still issue guidelines on eating Great Lakes salmon. And while measures are now in place to curb overfishing in the East--including river classification systems, lower creel limits and an end to commercial fishing--Atlantic salmon populations remain at record low numbers. Still, there are signs of hope. According to the Atlantic Salmon Federation, returns to many of Newfoundland and Labrador's 176 rivers, for example, are increasing.


In "Where'd they come from?" Gary Ball revealed how Canadians have altered fish populations across the country through the likes of over-fishing and the stocking of non-native species--from the extirpation of Lake Ontario's Atlantic salmon to releases of brookies and 'bows in Alberta to introductions of bass on both coasts. These days, attempts to reintroduce Atlantics to Lake Ontario continue to fail, while fisheries managers on both coasts struggle to deal with illegally stocked bass. Meanwhile, Parks Canada is considering options for ridding Banff National Park's Moraine Lake of its non-native brookies and 'bows so it can restore native bull trout. The meddling goes on.},

Biochemical Adaptation: Mechanisms and Process in Physiological Evolution asks two primary questions. First, how have the core biochemical systems found in all species been adaptively modified to allow the same fundamental types of physiological processes to be sustained throughout the wide range of habitat conditions found in the biosphere? Second, through what types of genetic and biochemical processes have new physiological functions been fabricated? The primary audience for this book is faculty, senior undergraduates, and graduate students in environmental biology, comparative physiology, and marine biology. Other likely readers include workers in governmental laboratories concerned with environmental issues, medical students interested in some elements of the book, and medical researchers.},

	abstract = {Identifying new genes and designing new tests at this point may simply open the door for new capitalist endeavours. Once diagnosed with a genetic malady, one might expect a barrage of tests to follow as a series of "preventive" measures. "That's good for the industry that develops the tests" (Hubbard 1995: 10), but not necessarily good for the individual who will be the subject of them. Diagnosing illness is not the same as creating health. With nothing but a diagnosis, no actual symptoms and no possible cure, all we have done for these "patients" is provide a label. Furthermore, it is likely that the cost of individual therapies and designer drugs will be very high as manufacturers try to recoup their development costs through the consumer. As a result, these therapies may be yet another location in which the widening gap between rich and poor is made manifest.


Many factors are related to disease in addition to, or other than, "bad genes." But in a reductionist approach to science the gene is understood as an isolate, something that can be manipulated with certain results. In a more integrated analysis, we recognize genes "are reliably predictive only in interaction with their original cellular context... (R)ather than being self-contained and abstractable, they are interactive elements that take their meaning from their context at the same time as they give their context meaning" (Burstyn 1993: 105-106, italics in original). In other words, even if a gene indicative of a "real" illness is found, no one can predict exactly how that illness will manifest in that particular body.


Critics fear that Roundup Ready and Bt varieties will spread their traits to other plants and organisms through pollen and other mechanisms and create incredibly strong plants that could displace indigenous varieties (Giddings 1998: 39; Shiva 1997: 36). Critics also suggest that the new prevalence of Bt, a natural pesticide, could reduce its effectiveness in the same way the overuse of antibiotics results in antibiotic resistance. This would devastate organic farming (Shiva 1997: 36-39). Control over GMOs is understood as impossible in an integrated model of the environment in which all things are interrelated. Keeping a few yards cleared between a field of genetically engineered canola and regular canola will not stop a bee from carrying pollen from one to the other. "Genetic engineers should never lose sight of the fact their creations are living and evolving, and that evolution is a mechanism for generating unlikely events" (Giddings 1997: 41). Because this kind of work is unprecedented, it may very well entail unprecedented risks that we have yet to imagine. Even if "the probability of an adverse transfer of genetic material may be very low, the consequences of such transfers might be very serious" (British Medical Association 1992: 159). In recognizing the limits of our capacity to determine risk, an integrated approach to GMOs would include an inclination to err on the side of caution rather than pursue short-term gain.},

	abstract = {"His research points to the fact that the single biggest problem in the Great Lakes is getting worse," said state Senator Ken Sikkema. Sikkema, sponsor of the legislation, criticizes federal control efforts as weak.


The acceleration of invasions could be because the St. Lawrence Seaway opened the entire Great Lakes to foreign ship traffic in 1959, [Anthony Ricciardi] said.


The round goby, native to the same Eurasian regions as the mussels, now thrives in the Great Lakes by eating zebra mussels. The gobies may ultimately help the mussels by keeping their numbers low enough that the mussels don't compete with each other for food, which could cause their numbers to alternately plunge and boom.},

	abstract = {In 1978, the United States and Canadian governments made an historic commitment to restoring the water quality of the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement calls for the restoration and maintenance of the integrity of the waters of the Great Lakes basin ecosystem.


Progress has been made in the Great Lakes basin in reducing emissions of persistent toxic substances. Nevertheless, these substances, which threaten the health of the ecosystem, including human health, continue to reach the Great Lakes through the air, coming from well beyond the Great Lakes basin. Without addressing the air transport of persistent toxics, the beneficial effects of sediments cleanup may never be fully achieved. It is now possible, with an atmospheric computer model and adequate emissions data, to link specific distant sources of an airborne pollutant to its deposition in a particular Great Lake. Adoption of this methodology can enable governments to design control measures to reduce atmospheric deposition of toxic substances to the Great Lakes. These airborne sources should be considered in determining the total pollution load of each lake, in developing lakewide management plans, and in implementing the Great Lakes Binational Toxics Strategy.


Invasions of alien species are irreversible and can disrupt ecosystem integrity. As zebra mussels have shown, when alien invasive species are introduced into the Great Lakes, they can upset the balance of the natural ecosystem, threaten native species, and require the expenditure of many millions of dollars in control and management costs. These invasions are estimated to cause billions of dollars in damages. Alien invasive species may survive in residual sediment in the ballast tanks of vessels and may be flushed into the Great Lakes when such a vessel subsequently takes on and discharges ballast water into the Great Lakes. Alien invasive species may also be introduced when ships, which have transited the St. Lawrence Seaway, discharge their ballast water into the Great Lakes. Other sources of alien invasive species are the baitfish and aquarium trades, and aquaculture has the potential to become one. These also need to be addressed.},

This invertebrate builds a chimney and sucks water down it, filtering out plankton and mussel larvae. Reproducing mussels release tiny larvae and pseudofeces, food rich in organic carbon that zebra mussels have processed but not consumed. This is meat and drink to Corophium.                 Ricciardi's colleague, Dr. MacIssac, has already found a single sample of one Corophium species in the Detroit River, which suggests an unsuccessful invasion but it's only a matter of time.},

Identifying new genes and designing new tests at this point may simply open the door for new capitalist endeavours. Once diagnosed with a genetic malady, one might expect a barrage of tests to follow as a series of "preventive" measures. "That's good for the industry that develops the tests" (Hubbard 1 995: 10), but not necessarily good for the individual who will be the subject of them. Diagnosing illness is not the same as creating health. With nothing but a diagnosis, no actual symptoms and no possible cure, all we have done for these "patients" is provide a label. Furthermore, it is likely that the cost of individual therapies and designer drugs will be very high as manufacturers try to recoup their development costs through the consumer. As a result, these therapies may be yet another location in which the widening gap between rich and poor is made manifest.


Critics fear that Roundup Ready and Bt varieties will spread their traits to other plants and organisms through pollen and other mechanisms and create incredibly strong plants that could displace indigenous varieties (Giddings 1 998: 39; Shiva 1 997: 36). Critics also suggest that the new prevalence of Bt, a natural pesticide, could reduce its effectiveness in the same way the overuse of antibiotics results in antibiotic resistance. This would devastate organic farming (Shiva 1997: 36-39). Control over GMOs is understood as impossible in an integrated model of the environment in which all things are interrelated. Keeping a few yards cleared between a field of genetically engineered canola and regular canola will not stop a bee from carrying pollen from one to the other. "Genetic engineers should never lose sight of the fact their creations are living and evolving, and that evolution is a mechanism for generating unlikely events" (Giddings 1997: 41). Because this kind of work is unprecedented, it may very well entail unprecedented risks that we have yet to imagine. Even if "the probability of an adverse transfer of genetic material may be very low, the consequences of such transfers might be very serious" (British Medical Association 1992: 159). In recognizing the limits of our capacity to determine risk, an integrated approach to GMOs would include an inclination to err on the side of caution rather than pursue short-term gain.},

The goby has a large appetite for zebra mussels, another lakes invader from Europe. As such, the goby could pose a health threat to people through the food chain, although Dermott said that's just a theoretical possibility at this point.},

	abstract = {Developmental stability refers to the ability to compensate for developmental upsets and produce an ideal phenotype. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is used as a measure of developmental stability. FA is a population-level pattern of deviations from bilateral symmetry. If a trait manifests FA, then asymmetry in individuals may be used as a reflection of the ability to buffer against developmental upsets. The literature on FA in humans and other animals is reviewed, with reference to a number of fundamental conceptual and empirical issues that affect the analysis and use of FA. Several ANOVA strategies for the analysis of FA are reviewed and a general framework for conceptualizing and analyzing FA is developed. The special problems presented by discrete data are discussed, and a strategy for analyzing asymmetry in fingerprints that combines data from fingerprint ridge counts and patterns is proposed. A method for statistically testing whether a number of asymmetries may be summed is presented. Data were collected from undergraduates (n = 145) on bilateral skeletal, facial, and fingerprint traits, health, personality pathology and intrasexual competitiveness. Not all asymmetries met the criteria for FA. In those that did, in general, there were relatively few relationships between individual asymmetries, or between asymmetry in individuals and health, personality pathology or competitiveness. No statistical justification was found for using composite asymmetry scores for sets of traits measured in the present study. Discussion focusses on comparing present results with previous findings, outlining possible limitations of the current study, evaluating the usefulness of particular bilateral traits in FA research, and suggesting directions for future studies.},

	abstract = {The valve movement responses (VMR) of freshwater unionid bivalves to increasing concentrations of total Mn, U, Cd or Cu, under conditions of varying pH and/or dissolved organic carbon (model fulvic acid) concentrations, were experimentally measured using a computer-based data acquisition system. Specifically, Velesunio angasi, from Magela Creek in tropical northern Australia, was exposed to Mn and/or U in synthetic freshwater between pH 5.0 and 6.0, both with and without model FA (3.15 or 7.91 mg L-1). In contrast, Hyridella depressa, from the Hawkesbury-Nepean River in temperate eastern Australia, was exposed to Cd and/or Cu in synthetic freshwater between pH 6.5 and 7.5, both with and without model FA (4.20 or 11.2 mg L-1). Despite differences in bivalve species, geographical location (climate) and water chemistry, valve movement patterns and concentration-response curves were similar for all metals. The results showed that VMR is a quantifiable, sensitive and rapid, realtime endpoint for assessing the toxic effects of metal exposures. For Mn or Cd, VMR was independent (P {\textgreater} 0.05) of pH and/or model FA concentration. In contrast, VMR to U or Cu was highly dependent (P {\textless} 0.05) on pH and/or model FA concentration; individuals were more sensitive to U or Cu at low pH and model FA concentrations. Additionally, results from the concentration-response experiments were used to evaluate the free ion activity model (FIAM). Drug-receptor theory was used to develop an extended form of the FIAM to obtain a more rigorous conceptual model. The developed model explains the conditions under which the FIAM will be effective in explaining biological response (BR), but more importantly, precisely quantifies the interaction of metal species at cell receptor sites. Valve movement responses to Mn or Cd were directly proportional to the activity of the free metal ion (Mn2+ or Cd2+), which is consistent with both the original and extended FIAM. In contrast, VMR to U or Cu were regarded as an 'exception' to the original FIAM, since they were a weighted function of the activities of the free metal ion and the 1 :1 metal hydroxide species (UO22+ + UO2OH+ or Cu2+ + CuOH+). However, this result is consistent with the extended FIAM, with BR primarily dependent on the activity of UOl+ or Cu2+, and secondarily dependent on the activity of OH-. Based on the extended FIAM, this study proposes, for the first time, a quantitative method of uncoupling the biological effects of a metal hydroxide species from that of amelioration of the free metal ion by H+. This is a major outcome, since the activities of metal hydroxide and H+cannot be independently varied. Additionally, concentration-response data obtained from the literature, that are considered to be 'exceptions' to the original FIAM, were reexamined and found to be consistent with the extended FIAM. Overall, the extended FIAM provides a potentially more useful tool for evaluating metal-organism interaction than the original FIAM.},

	doi = {10.1080/02722019709481557},
	abstract = {About three decades ago, the environmental viability of the Basin began to be seen as highly jeopardized. The seeming ecological demise of Lake Erie, a series of blazes along waterways such as the Cuyahoga River, and mounting evidence that other lakes (particularly Michigan and Ontario) were seriously threatened served to trigger considerable debate over whether ecological health could be regained or if the Basin was trapped in an irreversible downhill slide. In addition to conventional contamination threats, the Basin also appears particularly vulnerable to the effects of cross-media pollution. Large surface waters, long residence time for water before it circulates out of the Basin, and prevailing air currents make all five lakes vulnerable to air deposition. More than one thousand organic compounds and heavy metals are detectable in all five lakes of the Basin, with air the only conceivable source in numerous instances (Colborn 1990). Other pervasive sources of cross-media pollutant transfer that often defy jurisdictional boundaries and threaten the Basin include groundwater discharge, landfill leaching, pesticide and topsoil runoff from agricultural activity and residential development, and release from contaminated lake-bottom sediments.              These distinct U.S. government initiatives have been supplemented with additional steps. The EPA created a Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO) in the late 1970s, primarily to oversee U.S. compliance with the GLWQA. Over time, GLNPO has expanded its duties, due in part to the 1990 Great Lakes Critical Programs Act and the 1990 Pollution Prevention Act. It has played a central role in the development of the GLI, serving as an intermediary between states, specific interests within the Basin, and both regional and central offices of the EPA. Since the eight states in the Basin are divided into three separate EPA regions (New York is in Region 2, Pennsylvania is in Region 3, and Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin are in Region 5), GLNPO's coordination role has been extremely important, assuring that there is a Basin-wide advocate within a highly fragmented agency. It has also worked closely with individual states and industries on various pollution prevention initiatives and continued implementation of more recent GLWQAs. GLNPO and other EPA offices have also distributed substantial funding to individual states for pollution prevention and related regulatory integration activities. Great Lakes states are consistent with those from other regions in relying on federal grant dollars for nearly half of their total pollution prevention expenditures, although there is considerable variation among individual Basin states in this regard (GAO 1994; Barnes 1994; [Doyle, Mary] 1995).              These developments should not serve, however, to obscure enduring challenges facing the Basin. Coordination of efforts across governmental levels remains difficult, and individual states and provinces have very mixed records in addressing region-wide concerns. Many of the most promising innovations remain in early stages of implementation, with their longterm performance or capacity for replication in other Basin jurisdictions unclear. Moreover, the recent history of the Basin reveals an ever-expanding set of challenges to ecosystem health. As external contaminants and exotic species continue to confound Basin policymakers, there is growing indication that the next round of internal policy development must focus on ubiquitous sources of contamination from within the Basin. Far beyond the traditional emphasis on large point sources of pollution, such as major industry, non-point water pollution may be the next -- and most substantial -- challenge yet faced. Non-point sources include virtually all residents in the Basin, including farmers and homeowners whose penchants for land development and pesticides invariably compound water quality problems. Viewing environmental protection in the Basin from this perspective, and attempting to bring its entire citizenry in line with common goals, represent a formidable challenge.},

It is on the prowl for acquisitions, but they must be compatible, [Harold Derkson] insists. ``We're not about to change our expertise.'' Prior to going public, the company divested itself of real estate and development interests -- anything not related to fish. ``If it doesn't smell like fish, I don't want to see it,'' Derkson said.              Since 1966, nearly a third of the total fish harvested in Ontario waters has been yellow perch. Fishermen follow the fate of yellow perch more closely because it represents nearly two-thirds of the total landed value from 1966 to 1991. It goes for about \$2.40 a pound compared to white perch which is worth about 40 cents a pound, [Mike Darnell] said.              The environment has changed in the last five years. Zebra mussels have cleaned the lake, to the detriment of perch which like turbid water. The clearer habitat favors pickerel which are now in abundance and easy to catch. Derkson expects the cycle to tilt again and perch will come back at the expense of pickerel.},

	abstract = {Lloyd Loope, a scientist at Haleakala National Park in Maui, says that alien species imported to Hawaii are the biggest threat to the islands' environment.  The 2nd biggest threat comes from aliens yet to be introduced.  Finally, the 3rd biggest threat is global climate change because it might help the invaders.  The reason that invasion does so much harm is that the invader finds itself released from the biological constraints which shaped its evolution.  Invaders normally arrive without the predators that feed on them, so their populations are limited mainly by food supply.  Not all invaders sneak in.  Almost all the food grown on Hawaii comes from plants that men brought with them.  Hawaii is attempting to stop the invasions.  Some imported species, including such potential disasters as cougars, alligators, scorpions, and piranha fish, have been caught before they could do harm.  The penalty for bringing in a snake has recently been increased to \$25,000.  The environmentalists' hopes are now pinned on the new administration in Washington, DC.},
