T1  - Standards for Quantitative Measurement of DNA Damage in Mammalian Cells
AN  - 2791656002
AB  - As the potential applications of DNA diagnostics continue to expand, there is a need for improved methods and standards for DNA analysis. This report describes several methods that could be considered for the production of reference materials for the quantitative measurement of DNA damage in mammalian cells. With the focus on DNA strand breaks, potentially useful methods for assessing DNA damage in mammalian cells are reviewed. The advantages and limitations of each method, as well as additional concerns with respect to reference material development, are also discussed. In conclusion, we outline strategies for developing candidate DNA damage reference materials that could be adopted by research laboratories in a wide variety of applications.

T1  - Extensive literature search on mineral oil hydrocarbons
AN  - 2780327313
AB  - An Extensive Literature Search (ELS) to collect and identify all studies published since 2010 and relevant to the topic mineral oil hydrocarbons in combination with the substance group characterisation, occurrence in food and toxicity was performed in the three databases PubMed, Web of Science and SciFinder® for six Areas. After combination of the searches from the three databases and removal of the duplicates, the total number of references is 2504. The evaluation of all retrieved references for relevance by screening the title and abstract and applying eligibility criteria (inclusion/exclusion) resulted in a total number of relevant references for Area 1 of 55, for Area 2 of 27, for Area 3 of 15, for Area 4 of 21 for Area 5 of 1 and for Area 6 of 6. The total number of relevant references was 93. However, for the substance group POH no relevant reference was identified. Additionally, there are 4 references additionally, which could not be clearly assigned.

T1  - The Early Pleistocene freshwater mollusks of the Denizli Basin (Turkey): a new long-lived lake fauna at the crossroads of Pontocaspian and Aegean-Anatolian realms
AN  - 2901445308
AB  - We describe here a newly discovered, diverse fossil fauna of freshwater gastropods and bivalves from the Denizli Basin in SW Turkey. The material was collected from the Kolankaya Formation, for which latest chronostratigraphic and magnetostratigraphic data indicate an Early Pleistocene age, which is much younger than previously assumed for the fossil-bearing strata of the Denizli Basin. The fauna consists of at least 27 species (25 gastropods, 2 bivalves) and includes a new genus, Harzhauseria gen. nov., and 6 new species within the Hydrobiidae : Falsipyrgula ? coronata sp. nov., Graecoanatolica ? alcicekorum sp. nov., Harzhauseria schizopleura gen. et sp. nov., Iraklimelania minutissima sp. nov., Iraklimelania submediocarinata sp. nov., and Xestopyrguloides ? sagitta sp. nov. Additionally, we define lectotypes for Staja orientalis (Bukowski, 1896) and Valvata orientalis Fischer, 1866, as well as a neotype for Theodoxus percarinatus (Oppenheim, 1919). Nine of the recovered species (33.3%) are only known from the Denizli Basin. Almost half of the fauna (44.7%) is endemic to the Aegean–Anatolian region, with biogeographical affinities to the Pliocene–Early Pleistocene faunas of Rhodes, Kos, and mainland Greece, as well as the Çameli and Eşen Basin in Turkey. On the genus level, the fauna also contains several typical Pontocaspian elements. The composition points toward a typical long-lived lake environment with oligohaline conditions.Alternate abstract:Wir beschreiben hier eine neu entdeckte, diverse fossile Fauna von Süßwassergastropoden und -Bivalven aus dem Denizli-Becken im Südwesten der Türkei. Das Material stammt aus der Kolankaya-Formation, für die neueste chronostratigraphische und magnetostratigraphische Daten auf ein frühpleistozänes Alter hindeuten, das viel jünger ist als bisher für die fossilführenden Schichten des Denizli-Beckens angenommen.

Neun der gefundenen Arten (33,3%) sind nur aus dem Denizli-Becken bekannt. Fast die Hälfte der Fauna (44,7%) ist endemisch für die ägäisch-anatolische Region, mit biogeografischen Verbindungen zu den pliozänen und frühpleistozänen Faunen von Rhodos, Kos und dem griechischen Festland sowie dem Çameli- und Eşen-Becken in der Türkei. Auf der Gattungsebene enthält die Fauna auch einige typische pontokaspische Elemente. Die Zusammensetzung deutet auf das Milieu eines typischen Langzeitsees mit oligohalinen Bedingungen hin.

T1  - Invertebrate C1q Domain-Containing Proteins: Molecular Structure, Functional Properties and Biomedical Potential
AN  - 2893091856
AB  - C1q domain-containing proteins (C1qDC proteins) unexpectedly turned out to be widespread molecules among a variety of invertebrates, despite their lack of an integral complement system. Despite the wide distribution in the genomes of various invertebrates, data on the structure and properties of the isolated and characterized C1qDC proteins, which belong to the C1q/TNF superfamily, are sporadic, although they hold great practical potential for the creation of new biotechnologies. This review not only summarizes the current data on the properties of already-isolated or bioengineered C1qDC proteins but also projects further strategies for their study and biomedical application. It has been shown that further broad study of the carbohydrate specificity of the proteins can provide great opportunities, since for many of them only interactions with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) was evaluated and their antimicrobial, antiviral, and fungicidal activities were studied. However, data on the properties of C1qDC proteins, which researchers originally discovered as lectins and therefore studied their fine carbohydrate specificity and antitumor activity, intriguingly show the great potential of this family of proteins for the creation of targeted drug delivery systems, vaccines, and clinical assays for the differential diagnosis of cancer. The ability of invertebrate C1qDC proteins to recognize patterns of aberrant glycosylation of human cell surfaces and interact with mammalian immunoglobulins indicates the great biomedical potential of these molecules.

T1  - To Eat or Not to Eat?—Food Safety Aspects of Essential Metals in Seafood
AN  - 2893042414
AB  - The popularity of seafoods is high due to their superb dietary properties and healthy composition. However, it is crucial to understand whether they adequately contribute to our essential nutritional needs. Small amounts of essential metals are indispensable in the human body to proper physiological functioning; their deficiency can manifest in various sets of symptoms that can only be eliminated with their intake during treatment or nutrition. However, the excessive consumption of metals can induce undesirable effects, or even toxicosis. Shellfish, oyster, and squid samples were collected directly from a fish market. After sample preparation, the concentration of essential metals (cobalt, chromium, copper, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc) was detected by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. The results were analyzed statistically using ANOVA and two-sample t-tests. The average concentration of the investigated essential elements and the calculated burden based on the consumption were below the Recommended Dietary Allowances and Tolerable Upper Intake Levels. Based on these results, the trace element contents of the investigated seafoods do not cover the necessary recommended daily intake of them, but their consumption poses no health hazard due to their low levels.

T1  - Amino acid and biochemical composition of Banded Carpet Shell (Polititapes rhomboides, Pennant, 1777), collected from the Çardak Lagoon, Turkey
AN  - 2871889615
AB  - Between January and December 2019, banded carpet shell (Poiititapes rhomboides, Pennant 1777) were gathered from Çardak Lagoon (Çanakkale Strait). The length value was found to range from 32.92 to 36.37 mm, weight between 7.90 and 1 1.75 g, condition index from 4.44 to 8.70, and meat yield was found to be ranging from 1 1.95% to 24.95%. Negative allometry was determined in the W/L relationship of P. rhomboides. The main meat component of P. rhomboides was moisture (54.70-65.57%) and protein (52.89-62.10%) with the other components being carbohydrate (1 0.95-21.30%), lipid (1 2.79-1 7.1 8%) and ash (7.69-1 9.93%). The correlation between moisture and carbohydrate was positive, whereas the correlation between moisture and protein was negative (p < 0.05). The present study not only informs us on composition but also recommends consumption of the species since it is easier to market and consume. Arginine amino acid was found to be the highest in quantity, which was followed by glutamic acid, serine, methionine, alanine, and aspartic acid.

T1  - Genome-wide identification and expression analysis of Dmrt genes in bivalves
AN  - 2852013806
AB  - In recent years, some common themes in the development of sex-specific traits in different animal lineages have started to emerge since the discovery of the Dmrt (doublesex-mab3-related transcription factor gene) genes. Bivalves are characterized by a diversity of sexual systems, including simultaneous hermaphroditism, sequential hermaphroditism, and strict gonochorism. However, to date, no research has focused on the genome-wide characterization and analysis of Dmrt genes in bivalves. In this study, the identification and analysis of Dmrt genes in 15 bivalves were performed using bioinformatics methods. A total of 55 Dmrt genes were retrieved in the studied bivalve genomes. The number of Dmrt genes in different species ranged from 3 to 5. The phylogenetic tree showed that Dmrt genes in bivalves can be subdivided into 5 classes: the Dmrt2-like class, Dmrt3-like class, Dmrt4/5-like class, Dsx-like class, and scallop-specific Dmrt class. The Ka/Ks ratios suggested that all Dmrt classes underwent purifying selection pressure. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal expression of Dmrt genes in four bivalve species suggested that different Dmrt genes may have different functions, and scallop-specific Dmrt genes may play a key role in sex determination/differentiation. In general, this study provides a molecular basis for in-depth examination of the functions of Dmrt genes and phylogenomic analyses in bivalves.

T1  - Molecular Cloning and Characteristics of a Lectin from the Bivalve Glycymeris yessoensis
AN  - 2779551005
AB  - C-type lectins (CTLs) are a family of carbohydrate-binding proteins that mediate multiple biological events, including adhesion between cells, the turnover of serum glycoproteins, and innate immune system reactions to prospective invaders. Here, we describe the cDNA cloning of lectin from the bivalve Glycymeris yessoensis (GYL), which encodes 161 amino acids and the C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) with EPN and WND motifs. The deduced amino acid sequence showed similarity to other CTLs. GYL is a glycoprotein containing two N-glycosylation sites per subunit. N-glycans are made up of xylose, mannose, D-glucosamine, 3-O-methylated galactose, D-quinovoses, and 3-O-methylated 6-deoxy-D-glucose. The potential CRD tertiary structure of the GYL adopted CTL-typical long-form double-loop structure and included three disulfide bridges at the bases of the loops. Additionally, when confirming the GYL sequence, eight isoforms of this lectin were identified. This fact indicates the presence of a multigene family of GYL-like C-type lectins in the bivalve G. yessoensis. Using the glycan microarray approach, natural carbohydrate ligands were established, and the glycotope for GYL was reconstructed as “Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ obligatory containing an additional fragment”, like a sulfate group or a methyl group of fucose or N-acetylgalactosamine residues.

T1  - Antinociceptive Effects of Aaptamine, a Sponge Component, on Peripheral Neuropathy in Rats
AN  - 2779497261
AB  - Aaptamine, a natural marine compound isolated from the sea sponge, has various biological activities, including delta-opioid agonist properties. However, the effects of aaptamine in neuropathic pain remain unclear. In the present study, we used a chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced peripheral neuropathic rat model to explore the analgesic effects of intrathecal aaptamine administration. We also investigated cellular angiogenesis and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression in the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord after aaptamine administration in CCI rats by immunohistofluorescence. The results showed that aaptamine alleviates CCI-induced nociceptive sensitization, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. Moreover, aaptamine significantly downregulated CCI-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), and LDHA expression in the spinal cord. Double immunofluorescent staining showed that the spinal VEGF and LDHA majorly expressed on astrocytes and neurons, respectively, in CCI rats and inhibited by aaptamine. Collectively, our results indicate aaptamine’s potential as an analgesic agent for neuropathic pain. Furthermore, inhibition of astrocyte-derived angiogenesis and neuronal LDHA expression might be beneficial in neuropathy.

T1  - Impact of Salinity Changes on the Antioxidation of Juvenile Yellowfin Tuna (Thunnus albacares)
AN  - 2767250421
AB  - To understand the impacts of salinity stress on the antioxidation of yellowfin tuna Thunnus albacares, 72 fishes (646.52 ± 66.32 g) were randomly divided into two treatments (32‰ and 29‰) and sampled at four time points (0 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h). The salinity of the control group (32‰) was based on natural filtered seawater and the salinity of the stress group (29‰) was reduced by adding tap water with 24 h aeration to the natural filtered seawater. The superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) from liver, gill, and muscle tissues were used as the antioxidant indexes in this study. The results showed that the changes of SOD and GSH-Px in the gills were first not significantly different from the control group (p > 0.05) and finally significantly higher than the control group (SOD: 50.57%, GSH-Px: 195.95%, p < 0.05). SOD activity in fish liver was not significantly changed from 0 h to 48 h (p > 0.05), and was not significantly different between the stress group and control group (p > 0.05). With the increase in stress time, GSH-Px and MDA activities in the liver of juvenile yellowfin tuna increased first (GSH-Px: 113.42%, MDA: 137.45%) and then reduced (GSH-Px: −62.37%, MDA: −16.90%) to levels similar to the control group. The SOD activity in the white and red muscle of juvenile yellowfin tuna first decreased (white muscle: −27.51%, red muscle: −15.52%) and then increased (white muscle: 7.30%, red muscle: 3.70%) to the level of the control group. The activities of GSH-Px and MDA in white and red muscle increased first (white muscle GSH-Px: 81.96%, red muscle GSH-Px: 233.08%, white muscle MDA: 26.89%, red muscle MDA: 64.68%) and then decreased (white muscle GSH-Px: −48.03%, red muscle GSH-Px: −28.94%, white muscle MDA: −15.93%, red muscle MDA: −28.67%) to the level observed in the control group. The results from the present study indicate that low salinity may lead to changes in the antioxidant function of yellowfin tuna juveniles. In contrast, yellowfin tuna juveniles have strong adaptability to the salinity of 29‰. However, excessive stress may consume the body’s reserves and reduce the body’s resistance.

T1  - Wistar Rats Hippocampal Neurons Response to Blood Low-Density Polyethylene Microplastics: A Pathway Analysis of SOD, CAT, MDA, 8-OHdG Expression in Hippocampal Neurons and Blood Serum Aβ42 Levels
AN  - 2766226498
AB  - Purpose: Low-density polyethylene microplastics are ingested into the bloodstream and distributed to all the organ tissue, including the hippocampus, causing toxic effects. This research aimed to elucidate the responses of hippocampal neurons to microplastic in the blood based on the expressions of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) enzymes, malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in hippocampal neurons, and blood serum amyloid beta 1– 42 (Aβ 42) levels using SMART PLS pathway analysis.
Methods: This was a pure experimental research on Wistar rats with a post-test control group design. Five experimental groups (X1, X2, X3, X4, X5) were given 0.0375 mg, 0.075 mg, 0.15 mg, 0.3 mg, and 0.6 mg of low-density polyethylene microplastics mixed in 2cc distilled water, respectively. Furthermore, except for control (C), the groups received microplastics an oral probe for 90 days.
Results: The molecular response of hippocampal neurons of Wistar rats to microplastics in the blood significantly decreased SOD enzyme expression, while CAT enzyme was unaffected. It considerably increased neuronal membrane damage (expression of MDA), increased considerably neuronal deoxyribonucleic acid damage (expression of 8-OHdG), and decreased blood serum Aβ 42 levels (pathway analysis, all t-value > 1.96).
Conclusion: The pathway analysis showed that hippocampal neurons were significantly affected by microplastic particles in the blood.

T1  - Immunogenic Effects of Dietary Terminalia arjuna Bark Powder in Labeo rohita, a Fish Model: Elucidated by an Integrated Biomarker Response Approach
AN  - 2761092599
AB  - Simple SummaryIt is widely believed that aquaculture has the greatest potential to provide both economic and nutritional security. Bacterial infections in the culture system result from intensified aquaculture methods, resulting in a significant economic loss for fishermen. Because antibiotics are the standard treatment for bacterial infections in Southeastern countries, antimicrobial resistance has emerged as a major health concern. Herbal remedies are being promoted as a replacement for the undesired medicines. In Ayurveda, the Terminalia arjuna plant is considered a “miracle plant” since it has been used for centuries to treat serious illnesses in humans. However, applications in aquaculture remain in their early stage. The purpose of this study is to assess the therapeutic value of incorporating powdered Terminalia arjuna bark with Labeo rohita. Based on the findings, the researchers suggest adding Terminalia arjuna bark powder to fish food at a rate of 12.3 g·kg−1 (as determined by the broken line regression equation) to help the fish become resistant to disease.AbstractUtilizing agro-industrial waste and herbal products to create a circular bioeconomy is becoming increasingly popular. Terminalia arjuna is a significant ethnomedicinal plant that has not yet been exploited in animal feed. In the present study, nutritional Terminalia arjuna bark powder-based fish feed was created and supplied to a candidate fish species Labeo rohita at varied levels: 0% (0 g/kg), 0.5% (5 g/kg), 1% (10 g/kg), and 1.5% (15 g/kg). These treatment groups are denoted as CT, T1, T2, and T3, respectively. Utilizing a contemporary comprehensive biomarker response strategy, the study clarified the genomic influence of dietary herb inclusion. In response to bacterial infection, the immunogenic genes, STAT 1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1), ISG 15 (interferon stimulating gene), and Mx “myxovirus resistance gene”, were shown to be elevated. The results of densitometry demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in STAT 1 and ISG 15, with Mx exhibiting maximal values at 1 g/kg TABP (Terminalia arjuna bark powder-based feed). This is the first study to identify TABP as an immunomodulator in fish and established the IBR (Integrated Bio-marker Response) as a reliable marker in evaluating the impact of multiple drivers in a holistic manner. Thus, the present study cleared the path for TABP to be utilized as an effective feed additive which enhances the specific adaptive immune system of the fish for the production of the Green fish product for a sustainable circular bioeconomy.

T1  - Investigating water movements around a shallow shipwreck in Big Tub Harbour of Lake Huron: Implications for managing and preserving underwater shipwrecks
AN  - 2760535001
AB  - The Sweepstakes, in Fathom Five National Marine Park, is Ontario’s most iconic shipwreck with over 100,000 visitors each summer. Continued exposure to water currents has directly and indirectly affected the integrity of the wreck and resulted in management interventions including efforts to stabilize the wreck and control vessel activity (both duration and speed). Despite these efforts, a scour ring is present in the sediment around the Sweepstakes, raising concerns regarding the prolonged stability of the wreck. An extensive series of field measurements were made during the summer of 2015 with the aim of differentiating between natural hydrological processes present at this site and human-derived water movements during the summer visitor season. There is a high-degree of natural current variability from processes as diverse as wind-induced surface gravity waves, internal gravity waves, and diurnal flows due to differential heating. Our results show that summer circulation driven by internal gravity waves derived from upwelling, surface waves, and differential heating was insignificant with respect to sediment resuspension and thus unlikely to produce the observed scour around the shipwreck. Scour is most likely caused by energetic winter storms, which should be a focus of future studies. While vessel induced currents were detectable at the shipwreck, they were no larger than the normal summer hydrodynamic variability, thus suggesting that management efforts continue to protect the site generally.

T1  - Dual-Mode Gold Nanoparticle-Based Method for Early Detection of Acanthamoeba
AN  - 2748551166
AB  - Acanthamoeba keratitis is an aggressive and rapidly progressing ocular pathology whose main risk factor is the use of contact lenses. An early and differential diagnosis is considered the main factor to prevent the progression and improve the prognosis of the pathology. However, current diagnosis techniques require time, complex and costly materials making an early diagnosis challenging. Thus, there is a need for fast, accessible, and accurate methods for Acanthamoeba detection by practitioners for timely and suitable treatment and even for contact lens user as preventive diagnosis. Here, we developed a dual-mode colorimetric-based method for fast, visual, and accurate detection of Acanthamoeba using gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). For this strategy, AuNPs were functionalized with thiolated probes and the presence of target Acanthamoeba genomic sequences, produce a colorimetric change from red to purple. This approach allows the detection of 0.02 and 0.009 μM of the unamplified Acanthamoeba genome by the naked eye in less than 20 min and by color analysis using a smartphone. Additionally, real samples were successfully analyzed showing the potential of the technology considering the lack of point-of-care tools that are mostly needed.

T1  - Molecular and Functional Characterization of a Short-Type Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein, Ct-PGRP-S1 in the Giant Triton Snail Charonia tritonis
AN  - 2724284352
AB  - Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in host antibacterial responses, and their functions have been characterized in most invertebrate and vertebrate animals. However, little information is available regarding the potential function of PGRPs in the giant triton snail Charonia tritonis. In this study, a short-type PGRP gene (termed Ct-PGRP-S1) was identified in C. tritonis. Ct-PGRP-S1 was predicted to contain several structural features known in PGRPs, including a typical PGRP domain (Amidase_2) and Src homology-3 (SH3) domain. The Ct-PGRP-S1 gene was constitutively expressed in all tissues examined except in proboscis, with the highest expression level observed in the liver. As a typical PRR, Ct-PGRP-S1 has an ability to degrade peptidoglycan (PGN) and was proven to have non-Zn2+-dependent amidase activity and antibacterial activity against Vibrio alginolyticus and Staphylococcus aureus. It is the first report to reveal the peptidoglycan recognition protein in C. tritonis, and these results suggest that peptidoglycan recognition protein Ct-PGRP-S1 is an important effector of C. tritonis that modulates bacterial infection resistance of V. alginolyticus and S. aureus, and this study may provide crucial basic data for the understanding of an innate immunity system of C. tritonis.

T1  - Mitochondrial marker implies fishery separate management units for spotted sardinella, Amblygaster sirm (Walbaum, 1792) populations in the South China Sea and the Andaman Sea
AN  - 2689956654
AB  - The spotted sardinella, Amblygaster sirm (Walbaum, 1792), is a commercial sardine commonly caught in Malaysia. Lack of management of these marine species in Malaysian waters could lead to overfishing and potentially declining fish stock populations. Therefore, sustainable management of this species is of paramount importance to ensure its longevity. As such, molecular information is vital in determining the A. sirm population structure and management strategy. In the present study, mitochondrial DNA Cytochrome b was sequenced from 10 A. sirm populations: the Andaman Sea (AS) (two), South China Sea (SCS) (six), Sulu Sea (SS) (one), and Celebes Sea (CS) (one). Accordingly, the intra-population haplotype diversity (Hd) was high (0.91–1.00), and nucleotide diversity (π) was low (0.002–0.009), which suggests a population bottleneck followed by rapid population growth. Based on the phylogenetic trees, minimum spanning network (MSN), population pairwise comparison, and FST,and supported by analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) tests, distinct genetic structures were observed (7.2% to 7.6% genetic divergence) between populations in the SCS and its neighboring waters, versus those in the AS. Furthermore, the results defined A. sirm stock boundaries and evolutionary between the west and east coast (which shares the same waters as western Borneo) of Peninsular Malaysia. In addition, genetic homogeneity was revealed throughout the SCS, SS, and CS based on the non-significant FSTpairwise comparisons. Based on the molecular evidence, separate management strategies may be required for A. sirm of the AS and the SCS, including its neighboring waters.

T1  - Disruption of anterior temporal lobe reduces distortions in memory from category knowledge
AN  - 2652731137
AB  - Memory retrieval does not provide a perfect recapitulation of past events, but instead an imperfect reconstruction of event-specific details and general knowledge. However, it remains unclear whether this reconstruction relies on mixtures of signals from different memory systems, including one supporting general knowledge. Here, we investigate whether the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) distorts new memories due to prior category knowledge. In this experiment (N=36), participants encoded and retrieved image-location associations. Most images' locations were clustered according to their category, but some were in random locations. With this protocol, we previously demonstrated that randomly located images were retrieved closer to their category cluster relative to their encoded locations, suggesting an influence of category knowledge. We combined this procedure with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered to the left ATL before retrieval. We separately examined event-specific details (error) and category knowledge (bias) to identify distinct signals attributable to different memory systems. We found that TMS to ATL attenuated bias in location memory, but only for atypical category members. The magnitude of error was not impacted, suggesting that a memory's fidelity can be decoupled from its distortion by category knowledge. This raises the intriguing possibility that retrieval is jointly supported by separable memory systems.

T1  - Mechanism of northern pike invasion in the Columbia River Basin
AN  - 2635119149
AB  - The spread of aquatic invasive species typically occurs through a combination of natural and human mediated dispersal. For many aquatic invasive species, natural dispersal is limited to aquatic corridors connecting habitat. In contrast, human transport may facilitate more distant dispersal and transport among disconnected waterbodies. Genetic information can serve as a powerful tool to track invasion histories and identify both the sources and mechanisms of invasive species dispersal. We used genetic information to understand invasion history and dynamics of expanding northern pike invasion in the Columbia River basin. Results indicate that the initial introduction of northern pike into the Pend Oreille River (in eastern Washington State) resulted from human transport of fish, not dispersal from established populations upstream. Subsequent reproduction and natural dispersal from the Pend Oreille River resulted in downstream expansion of northern pike into Lake Roosevelt, a reservoir within the mainstem Columbia River. These results highlight the need for a holistic approach to suppression of invasive species. Immediate efforts must address the biological mechanisms of natural dispersal. Sustained suppression and eradication must take a broad approach that includes coordination between management agencies, as well as policy and public outreach aimed at prevention of repeated human transport events. The genetic database created from this study has already been used to eliminate potential source populations for new northern pike invasions in Washington State outside the Columbia River basin. This highlights the utility of genetic monitoring for both immediate and long-term applications to managing aquatic species invasions.

T1  - The Effect of Camouflage on the Escape Behaviour of Common Shore Crabs
AN  - 2925385397
AB  - For any prey animal, avoiding and fleeing from predators is one of the most important tasks in the key to survival. In order to avoid predation, a prey on detecting the predator must make appropriate decisions on how to respond to the threat. According to the optimal escape theory, initiation of escape should be a balance between the costs of staying (such as predation risk or death) and costs of fleeing (such as loss of feeding and reproductive opportunities and energy expenditure). Camouflage, particularly background matching, is also an important and widespread antipredator strategy, and it is commonly predicted that the likelihood of fleeing from a predator should depend on the level of camouflage of a prey animal. Moreover, most organisms encounter multiple predators rather than a single predator. Each predator possesses a different visual system and demonstrate various means of foraging and capture behaviour. Consequently, it becomes difficult for the prey to use the same antipredator strategy for multiple predators so prey species may evolve to form predator-specific responses as a counter strategy. Although a number of recent studies have considered the camouflage aspect in the common shore crab, research on how it works in combination with escape behaviour and whether it is affected by the type of predator remains unanswered. Although the association between camouflage strategies and escape behaviour has been researched in the past literature, many of these studies focus on the vertebrate taxa or do not directly measure camouflage and only few of them explore multiple predators. Within this thesis, I aim to address these gaps through a series of field-based experiments using background and predator treatments in the common shore crab (Carcinus maenas).In chapter 2, I investigate the effects of camouflage on the escape response of shore crabs using mismatched backgrounds. Individuals were placed on the mismatched backgrounds and exposed to predator treatment and control of no predator treatment. The camouflage of crabs was measured in terms of brightness and colour difference using image analysis. Predator and background independently rather than their interaction had a significant influence on the escape behaviour. However, brightness and colour difference did not significantly affect their flight response. In addition, I also examined the effects of camouflage using substrate heterogeneity on the escape response of these crabs. Here, the camouflage based on brightness difference affected their escape behaviour on interaction with predator and substrate. Colour difference alone had a significant effect on the fleeing times and the interaction between predator and substrate was also found to be significant.In chapter 3, I explore whether the escape responses of shore crabs are tailored to the type of predators using the same camouflage metrics. Here, predator and background when considered independently were found significant. Additionally, size of crabs was also significantly influencing the escape behaviour of crabs. Overall, this thesis indicates that camouflage influences the escape behaviour of prey species in complex heterogenous environments. Furthermore, it suggests that crabs and possibly other marine animals are capable of distinguishing between different predators and alter their escape responses based on the level of perceived threat.

T1  - Sclerochronology and Modelling: Combining Annually Resolved Bivalve Records and Biogeochemical Models to Understand the Shelf Seas
AN  - 2838333826
AB  - The shelf seas are extremely vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Projected to warm at substantially greater rates than the open ocean, understanding how shelf sea systems operate and how they will respond to future change is of vital importance. Policy decision-makers rely on high quality information to ensure the protection of marine habitats and ecosystem services. While model studies can provide such data, they require spatially and temporally-extensive datasets for verification. Currently, this type of data is highly limited for the shelf seas, particularly at depth.Sclerochronology of bivalve molluscs has shown great potential to extend instrumental data for the shelf seas, providing absolutely-dated, multi-centennial, annually-resolved archives of past ocean environment, analogous to dendrochronology in terrestrial environments. Bivalve molluscs have a wide distribution, and can be found on the shelf environments living at depth on the sea floor. Yet sclerochronology is a developing field with a number of fundamental research gaps limiting the use of sclerochronology as a valuable marine proxy. This thesis addresses three of those gaps:Chapter 2 (Methods Development: Imaging shells for sclerochronology)presents a novel and non-destructive method for imaging the internal growth bands of bivalves used in sclerochronology – micro computed tomography (micro-CT). Micro-CT uses x-rays to create 3D high resolution images of the internal structure of specimens. Experiments evaluated whether density or resolution could limit bivalves from being imaged and showed that subtle microstructural features can be seen in the micro-CT images of even the most dense bivalve species. The research suggested that with future development in micro-CT technology including increased resolution and power, analysis of bivalve growth bands via micro-CT may be possible, significantly reducing the time required to produce highly valuable sclerochronology records and allowing more records to be constructed.Chapter 3 (Sclerochronology and 1D modelling: a novel study using a 1D ecosystem model to better interpret sclerochronology records)focuses on a fundamental problem in sclerochronology - the lack of understanding regarding the mechanistic drivers of shell growth. Here, a 1D ecosystem model GOTM-ERSEM- BFM was used explore these mechanisms. The model was able to simulate the shell growth of a central North Sea composite chronology which allowed exploration of ecosystem processes to understand the mechanisms that lead to growth. Experiments manipulating the meteorological inputs to the model mechanistically attributed variability in surface heating and wind temperature as key controls on shell growth in the central North Sea.Chapter 4 (Southern North Sea sclerochronologies: using shell records to test hypotheses across hydrological and biological gradients)addresses the scarcity of long-term productivity information in the North Sea which currently limits an understanding of historical variability. In particular, accurate measurements of North Sea productivity are limited by the poor quantification of sub-surface chlorophyll which cannot be measured by remote sensing or surface phytoplankton surveying. 12 new sclerochronology records of the bivalve mollusc Arctica islandica were produced from 4 locations in the southern North Sea to test if bivalve growth differs across productivity and hydrography gradients, and investigate whether shell records capture sub-surface chlorophyll variability. Differences in the rate of raw growth of Arctica islandica was demonstrated between regions of high and low productivity, supported by variations in synchronicity (estimated population signals) of multiple composite chronologies constructed using the shells records. These results suggest that sub surface chlorophyll may play a role in Arctica islandicashell growth but how this interacts with stratification regimes in the North Sea is difficult to quantify due to complex interactions of biology and other hydrographical features in the region. Further research is required in other locations to better understand impact of stratification and sub-surface productivity on shell growth and subsequently North Sea ecosystems.The novel research presented in this thesis has advanced the fields of sclerochronology and ecosystem modelling and has laid the foundation for transformative approaches to sclerochronology. By developing the methods needed to understand long-term variability of shelf sea environments, particularly at depth, this work has contributed to improving the understanding of past and future climate change in the shelf seas.

T1  - Quantifying Ecosystem Functions through Fish and Epifaunal Invertebrate Communities in Newport Bay
AN  - 2778394118
AB  - Despite its recognized importance, significant areas of wetland habitat have been lost. With that loss, there has been a decline in native species and the functions they provide. One solution to overcome this loss of both organisms and functions has been restoration. My study assessed paired oyster and eelgrass restoration through response of fish and epifaunal invertebrates. Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) and eelgrass (Zostera marina) were restored, separately and paired, at four sites in Newport Bay, CA in 2016 and 2017. I monitored fish communities using baited camera traps and epifauna using oyster bed excavations (OSUs) for 3-years post-complete restoration. I hypothesized that both fish and epifaunal invertebrate abundance and diversity within restored habitats would increase through time due to maturation of structure-forming habitats of the oyster beds and eelgrass. Although site remained an important factor influencing the fish and epifauna communities, it is likely that this is due to variation in the restoration trajectory of the oyster beds and eelgrass at each site. Immediately post-restoration, one site, Shellmaker, was most often distinct from other sites due to its lack of eelgrass. As time progressed, the beds at Shellmaker remained most intact but eelgrass beds did develop. This meant that site differences remained for epifaunal invertebrates but fish communities reflects the treatments (mainly eelgrass presence). While additional monitoring is needed both on these communities and for other abiotic correlates, the restoration of oysters and eelgrass in a paired design appears to positively affect the fish and epifaunal communities within this southern California estuary over a 3-year time scale.

T1  - Influence of Anthropogenic Activities on Redox Regulation and Oxidative Stress Responses in Different Phyla of Animals in Coastal Water via Changing in Salinity
AN  - 2756824359
AB  - Salinity is a decisive abiotic factor that modulates the physiology of aquatic organisms. Salinity itself is modulated by various factors—most notably by anthropogenic factors. In coastal regions, increasing salinity is observed mostly due to the elevated rate of evaporation under high temperatures, especially under global warming. In addition, many other anthropogenic factors, climatic factors, chemicals, etc., also contribute to the changes in salinity in coastal water. Some of these include rainfall, regional warming, precipitation, moisture, thermohaline circulation, gaseous pollutants, dissolved chemicals, wind flow, and biocrusts. Salinity has been found to regulate the osmotic balance and, thus, can directly or indirectly influence the biomarkers of oxidative stress (OS) in aquatic organisms. Imbalances in OS potentially affect the growth, production, and reproduction of organisms; therefore, they are being studied in organisms of economic or aquacultural importance. Salinity-modulated OS and redox regulation as a function of phylum are covered in this review. The literature from 1960 to 2021 indicates that the altered OS physiology under changing salinity or in combination with other (anthropogenic) factors is species-specific, even within a particular phylum. Thus, knowing the response mechanisms of such organisms to salinity may be useful for the management of specific aquatic animals or their habitats.

T1  - Freshwater Mussels Show Elevated Viral Richness and Intensity during a Mortality Event
AN  - 2756812661
AB  - Freshwater mussels (Unionida) are among the world’s most imperiled taxa, but the relationship between freshwater mussel mortality events and infectious disease is largely unstudied. We surveyed viromes of a widespread and abundant species (mucket, Actinonaias ligamentina; syn: Ortmanniana ligamentina) experiencing a mortality event of unknown etiology in the Huron River, Michigan, in 2019–2020 and compared them to viromes from mucket in a healthy population in the St. Croix River, Wisconsin and a population from the Clinch River, Virginia and Tennessee, where a mortality event was affecting the congeneric pheasantshell (Actinonaias pectorosa; syn: Ortmanniana pectorosa) population. We identified 38 viruses, most of which were associated with mussels collected during the Huron River mortality event. Viral richness and cumulative viral read depths were significantly higher in moribund mussels from the Huron River than in healthy controls from each of the three populations. Our results demonstrate significant increases in the number and intensity of viral infections for freshwater mussels experiencing mortality events, whereas individuals from healthy populations have a substantially reduced virome comprising a limited number of species at low viral read depths.

T1  - Status and Trends in the Rate of Introduction of Marine Non-Indigenous Species in European Seas
AN  - 2756682562
AB  - Invasive alien species are a major worldwide driver of biodiversity change. The current study lists verified records of non-indigenous species (NIS) in European marine waters until 2020, with the purpose of establishing a baseline, assessing trends, and discussing appropriate threshold values for good environmental status (GES) according to the relevant European legislation. All NIS records were verified by national experts and trends are presented in six-year assessment periods from 1970 to 2020 according to the European Union Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Altogether, 874 NIS have been introduced to European marine waters until 2020 with the Mediterranean Sea and North-East Atlantic Ocean hosting most of the introductions. Overall, the number of new introductions has steadily increased since 2000. The annual rate of new introductions reached 21 new NIS in European seas within the last six-year assessment period (2012–2017). This increase is likely due to increased human activities and research efforts that have intensified during the early 21st century within European Seas. As Europe seas are not environmentally, nor geographically homogenous, the setting of threshold values for assessing GES requires regional expertise. Further, once management measures are operational, pathway-specific threshold values would enable assessing the effectiveness of such measures.

T1  - Small Hydropower Plants’ Impacts on the Ecological Status Indicators of Urban Rivers
AN  - 2756661736
AB  - Water is the basis of life for living creatures and is used for various purposes, especially in agriculture, industry, municipal services, and energy production. Assessing water quality in terms of its various uses is not without significance. This study investigates the water quality within two small hydropower plants (SHPs) in central European urban areas from an environmental perspective. Wrocław I and Wrocław II SHPs on the Odra River in Poland were selected as case studies. This study presents the results of four-year observations (2017–2020) conducted in different locations located upstream and downstream of the barriers. The following aspects were assessed: physicochemical status, trophic status, assessment of fish living conditions, and water quality indices. The results show that SHPs improved the average physicochemical status of the five-day biochemical oxygen demand (i.e., BOD5; by 6.19% comparing the results downstream and upstream of the SHPs), dissolved oxygen (3.85%), PO4-P (3.31%), and electrical conductivity (0.52%); however, they worsened in the case of the pH (by 2.63%) and NO3-N (by 1.83%). Water near the study cases is classified as mesotrophic or eutrophic. The conditions for salmonids and cyprinids were not met due to the increased concentrations of NO2 and BOD5 values; in the case of salmonids, also due to the temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration. The water quality indices differed and indicated the quality from poor to good, depending on the classification. This study provides important insights for policymakers regarding the awareness of the impacts of SHPs on water quality in urban areas and the immediate measure needed to be considered to improve aquatic habitat conditions.

T1  - Towards a Sustainable World: Diversity of Freshwater Gastropods in Relation to Environmental Factors—A Case in the Konya Closed Basin, Türkiye
AN  - 2734622091
AB  - The Konya Closed Basin (KCB) in Türkiye plays a key role in agricultural production and freshwater supply. However, the basin is impacted by humanly derived nitrogenous compounds and toxic metals. Keeping the water quality at a potable level in the basin is compulsory. This study was part of a project yielding monitoring of water quality in KCB in accordance with the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC). Eleven stations, except Beyşehir Lake and Mamasın Dam, were sampled for the first time for freshwater molluscs. Community structure indexes and multivariate statistical analyses were applied to determine the microhabitats of gastropods and their responses to environmental changes. The structure and distribution of gastropod assemblages differed depending on total phosphate, total nitrogen, dissolved oxygen, and pH. This study revealed that most of the gastropods in KCB are relatively tolerant to biodegradable pollution. However, there is a strong observed decline in population size requiring intensive future monitoring; measures have to be taken to preserve the remaining populations. Two endemic species need an urgent action plan to protect their habitats: Theodoxus anatolicus of Çeltik Canal and Bithynia pseudemmericia of Beyşehir Lake; a re-assessment of their extinction risk according to the IUCN rules is needed (2022). The results of this study will be useful for comparison with future studies to document potential improvements or continued ecological regression in the quality of aquatic ecosystems in the watershed.

T1  - A Rapid Assessment Toolkit to Monitor the Ecotoxicological Impact of Oil Spills
AN  - 2732212342
AB  - Crude oils are natural substances derived from the degraded remains of organic matter and are typically complex and highly variable in nature. Toxicological assessment following an oil spill is challenging not only due to the variable chemical characteristics as a slick spreads and weathers, but also to the vulnerability of the affected ecosystem. Rapid decisions must be made to determine how to respond to the spill to protect the environment. Hence, a rapid assessment toolkit specific to the ecotoxicological assessment of crude oil and its components has been recommended. This thesis aimed to develop such a rapid assessment toolkit based on state of the art, environmentally relevant, diagnostic chemical and biological tools. Challenges to be addressed included the choice of test species, the dosing method for ensuring a consistent exposure concentration and the extrapolation of the data to predict species sensitivity and ecosystem relevance using computational modelling tools. To determine the applicability and comparative sensitivity of cyst-based zooplankton survival assays (using brine shrimp Artemia franciscana and marine rotifer Brachionus plicatilis) a novel, miniature passive dosing method was developed. Using three exemplar aromatic hydrocarbons, brine shrimp and rotifer were found to be within 51- 75% and 76–100% of most resistant species respectively when compared to 79 other species. When these species sensitivities were extrapolated using computational modelling (PETROTOX) to predict the relative toxicity of crude oil, they provided a conservative estimate when compared to empirical data derived from laboratory tests. In addition, comparison of novel, passively dosed water accommodated fraction preparation methods and traditional low energy, and chemically enhanced, water accommodated fraction methods showed both methods to be applicable to laboratory testing. Finally, investigation of cardiotoxicity as a non-invasive, sublethal biomarker was investigated as an endpoint potentially more sensitive than the whole organism cyst based tests. The sensitivity of three life stages (pediveliger eyed larvae, spat and adults) of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) was assessed using a novel combination of passive dosing and non-invasive video graphic and infrared methods. Illustrating both the utility of the methods and relative insensitivity of the organisms to phenanthrene as a model compound. Owing to the lack of sensitivity observed in these studies, it was not possible to recommend the biological test methods used above as a complete rapid assessment toolkit. However, the combination of chemical and computational tools showed effectiveness in reaching and maintaining exposure concentrations and providing a conservative estimate of toxicity. A synthesis of findings concludes with suggestions for future directions for the development of oil spill monitoring tools; the consideration of multi-stressor impacts; recommendations of a screening matrix for the future identification of sensitive bioindicators; and alternative endpoints of interest (e.g. indicators of membrane damage, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and indicators of oxidative stress).

T1  - Climate and Land Use Driven Ecosystem Homogenization in the Prairie Pothole Region
AN  - 2724298773
AB  - The homogenization of freshwater ecosystems and their biological communities has emerged as a prevalent and concerning phenomenon because of the loss of ecosystem multifunctionality. The millions of prairie-pothole wetlands scattered across the Prairie Pothole Region (hereafter PPR) provide critical ecosystem functions at local, regional, and continental scales. However, an estimated loss of 50% of historical wetlands and the widespread conversion of grasslands to cropland make the PPR a heavily modified landscape. Therefore, it is essential to understand the current and potential future stressors affecting prairie-pothole wetland ecosystems in order to conserve and restore their functions. Here, we describe a conceptual model that illustrates how (a) historical wetland losses, (b) anthropogenic landscape modifications, and (c) climate change interact and have altered the variability among remaining depressional wetland ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem homogenization) in the PPR. We reviewed the existing literature to provide examples of wetland ecosystem homogenization, provide implications for wetland management, and identify informational gaps that require further study. We found evidence for spatial, hydrological, chemical, and biological homogenization of prairie-pothole wetlands. Our findings indicate that the maintenance of wetland ecosystem multifunctionality is dependent on the preservation and restoration of heterogenous wetland complexes, especially the restoration of small wetland basins.

T1  - Seasonal Dynamics of Lake Winnipeg’s Microbial Communities Reveal Aerobic Anoxygenic Phototrophic Populations Coincide with Sunlight Availability
AN  - 2716576866
AB  - In this first comprehensive study of Lake Winnipeg’s microbial communities, limnetic and littoral euphotic zones were examined during each season from 2016 through 2020. Classical cultivation and modern high-throughput sequencing techniques provided quantification and identification of key phototrophic populations, including aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAP). Annual dynamics found total heterotrophs reached 4.23 × 106 CFU/g in littoral sands, and 7.69 × 104 CFU/mL in summer littoral waters on oligotrophic media, higher counts than for copiotrophic compositions. Limnetic numbers inversely dipped to 4.34 × 103 CFU/mL midsummer. Cultured AAP did not follow heterotrophic trends, instead peaking during the spring in both littoral and limnetic waters as 19.1 and 4.7% of total copiotrophs, or 3.9 and 4.9% of oligotrophs, decreasing till autumn each year. Complementary observations came from environmental 16S V4 rRNA gene analysis, as AAP made up 1.49 and 1.02% of the littoral and limnetic sequenced communities in the spring, declining with seasonal progression. Spatial and temporal fluctuations of microbes compared to environmental factors exposed photosynthetic populations to independently and regularly fluctuate in the ecosystem. Oxygenic phototrophic numbers expectantly matched the midsummer peak of Chl a and b, oxygenic photosynthesis related carbon fixation, and water temperature. Independently, AAP particularly colonized spring littoral areas more than limnetic, and directly corresponded to habitat conditions that specifically promoted growth: the requirement of light and organic material.

T1  - Toxoplasma gondii in African Wildlife: A Systematic Review
AN  - 2706270020
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a protozoan parasite, which infects a wide variety of mammals and bird species globally. In large parts of the world, this parasite is relatively well documented in wildlife species, however, this topic is poorly documented in Africa. The current review systematically explores the presence and distribution of T. gondii in African wildlife species through a key word search in PubMed, Web of Science and CAB Direct. A total of 66 records were identified and included in the qualitative analysis, of which 19 records were retained for the quantitative synthesis. The presence of T. gondii was reported in a wide range of wildlife species, found in twelve countries, spread over the African continent. The retained records report a prevalence range of 6–100% in herbivores, 8–100% in omnivores and 14–100% in carnivores. In wild felines (cheetahs, leopards, and lions) a prevalence range of 33–100% was found. Reports from South Africa, and on the presence of T. gondii in lion were most common. Overall, the results indicate the scarcity of information on T. gondii in Africa and its circulation in wildlife. The lack of knowledge on the parasite in Africa, especially in areas at the human-livestock-wildlife interface, prevents us from understanding how prevalent it is on the continent, what strains are circulating in wildlife and what the most common routes of transmission are in the different habitats in Africa.

T1  - Phase synchronization of chlorophyll and total phosphorus oscillations as an indicator of the transformation of a lake ecosystem
AN  - 2688786232
AB  - The ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes (Belarus) includes three water bodies, Lake Batorino, Lake Myastro and Lake Naroch. These lakes have a common catchment area. At the end of the 80 s, the ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes underwent a transformation, during which the nutrient load on the catchment area decreased, and the concentration of phosphorus as a limiting factor in these water bodies decreased significantly. At the same time, the Naroch Lakes were exposed to zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas) invasion. In the mid-90 s, the biological and hydrochemical characteristics of the ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes stabilized. We show here that complex processes associated with the transformation of the lake ecosystem and affecting both trophic interactions in the Naroch Lakes and the influence of environmental factors on them can be represented using a single parameter, the phase-locking index, PLI. In this case, a statistically significant numerical value of PLI characterizes the phase synchronization of two processes, oscillations of the concentration of total phosphorus, TP, and oscillations of the concentration of chlorophyll, Chl. We show that the phase synchronization of these processes occurs only after the stabilization of the ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes. In the period preceding the transformation of the lake ecosystem, there was no synchronization. Numerical evaluation of PLI as a holistic parameter allows us to characterize the transformation of the lake ecosystem as a whole without resorting to study of complex interactions of various factors involved in this transformation.

T1  - Environmental DNA-Based Methods in Biodiversity Monitoring of Protected Areas: Application Range, Limitations, and Needs
AN  - 2679711896
AB  - Novel methods for species detection based on collection of environmental DNA (eDNA) are not only important in biodiversity assessment in a scientific context, but are also increasingly being applied in conservation practice. The eDNA-based biodiversity detection methods have significant potential for regular use in biodiversity status assessments and conservation actions in protected areas (PAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) worldwide. Species detection based on DNA from environmental samples, such as water, sediment, soil, air, or organic material, has a broad application scope with precise, comprehensive, and rapid species identification. Here, we provide an overview of the application range of eDNA-based methods for biodiversity monitoring in PAs, evaluate environmental assessments in which this technology has already been implemented for nature conservation, and examine the challenges that can hamper further application in real world practice. Based on the outcomes of two projects, practical experience, and current scientific literature focusing on their application, we conclude that eDNA-based species detection methods provide promising novel approaches that have strong potential as supplement methods, or in some cases even as substitutes for the conventional monitoring methods used for PAs. This advancement is expected to affect decision-making in biodiversity conservation efforts in PAs and OECMs.

T1  - Phosphorus and Oxygen Dynamics between Fall and Spring Turnover Events in a Small Canadian Shield Lake
AN  - 2665130801
AB  - In dimictic lakes, the stable density stratification during summer and winter inhibits vertical mixing of nutrients and oxygen. This favors the development of hypolimnetic hypoxia, which degrades cool-water fish habitat and enhances nutrient mineralization and diffusion from the sediments. Fall turnover began once the entire water column become nearly isothermal (within 0.4 °C) at the deepest point of the lake and continued to the onset of winter stratification. Similarly, spring turnover began when the water column became nearly isothermal (within 0.4 °C) and continued until the average water column temperature reached 4.0 to 4.5 °C. Fall and spring turnover events, therefore, provide a crucial bi-annual link between surface and bottom waters. Long-term field observations were supplemented with output from a three-dimensional numerical model, to better understand the hydrodynamics of turnovers and associated dissolved oxygen (DO) and orthophosphate (PO4) dynamics within a small temperate lake during 2011 to 2020. Mid-basin convection contributed the most to turnover events. During fall turnover, wind shear only mixed the upper 35% of the surface mixed layer, with convection acting to deepen below. During spring turnover, ice-cover sheltered the lake from wind, causing convection to be the only process occurring and lengthening the turnover duration (~51 days) compared to fall (~13 days).Photosynthetic production was modelled to contribute 92% of the total dissolved oxygen (DO) input to the lake, the remaining 8% was from atmospheric exchange. Of the DO production, 41% occurred under ice with a potential to contribute 17±11% of the hypolimnetic DO saturation deficit at spring turnover. The occurrence of spring turnover depended on the winter conditions. Warm winters caused a weak inverse stratification that shortened the deepening of the convective mixed layer (CML) under the ice and inhibited spring turnover induced mixing of DO into the hypolimnion. Conversely, cold winters caused an inverse stratification in which watercolumn became isothermal after the CML deepened and removed the stratification. Then, the incoming heat from the surface caused large vertical convections (spring turnover). Severe winters form a very strong inverse stratification that limits the effectiveness of spring turnover.Mineralization was the main PO4 source producing with 77-98% of the annual internal load. The remaining PO4 (2-23%) was from anoxic sediments. Fall turnover upwelled the trapped PO4 from hypolimnion into the photic zone where it could initiate the spring algal bloom. The bloom was postponed because phytoplankton was mixed to depth with fall turnover mixing events, where their growth was light limited until the seasonal increase in solar radiation in spring.

T1  - Linking Micropollutants to Trait Syndromes across Freshwater Diatom, Macroinvertebrate, and Fish Assemblages
AN  - 2653035567
AB  - The ecological quality of freshwater ecosystems is endangered by various micropollutants released into the environment by human activities. The cumulative effects of these micropollutants can affect the fitness of organisms and populations and the functional diversity of stream ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the relationships between the joint toxicity of micropollutants and trait syndromes. A trait syndrome corresponds to a combination of traits that could occur together in communities due to the trait selection driven by exposure to these micropollutants. Our objectives were to (i) identify trait syndromes specific to diatom, macroinvertebrate, and fish assemblages and their responses to exposure, taking into account four micropollutant types (mineral micropollutants, pesticides, PAHs, and other organic micropollutants) and nine modes of action (only for pesticides), (ii) explore how these syndromes vary within and among the three biological compartments, (iii) investigate the trait categories driving the responses of syndromes to micropollutant exposure, and (iv) identify specific taxa, so-called paragons, which are highly representative of these syndromes. To achieve these objectives, we analyzed a dataset including the biological and physico-chemical results of 2007 sampling events from a large-scale monitoring survey routinely performed in French wadeable streams. We have identified five (diatoms), eight (macroinvertebrates), and eight (fishes) trait syndromes, either positively or negatively related to an increasing toxicity gradient of different clusters of micropollutant types or modes of action. Our analyses identified several key trait categories and sets of paragons, exhibiting good potential for highlighting exposure by specific micropollutant types and modes of action. Overall, trait syndromes might represent a novel and integrative bioassessment tool, driven by the diversity of trait-based responses to increasing gradients of micropollutant toxic cocktails.

T1  - Assessing the Variances of Citizen Stakeholder Justice in Watershed Governance: Is Action More Effective with Reactive or Proactive Administrations
AN  - 2642487945
AB  - Watershed governance has historically been administered by natural resource experts and is often inaccessible to citizen stakeholders. Although many advocate for deliberative democracy as a pathway toward natural resource sustainability, others remain skeptical due to perceived tradeoffs. Environmental deliberative democracy (EDD) serves as a conceptual synthesis of collaborative principles. This research compares the social, economic, and political discourses in two Wisconsin watersheds (Geneva Lake in regulatory compliance and Green Lake, which is deemed state impaired) and posits that EDD community compatibility is enhanced by public trust in expert capacity and accessible watershed education resources. A mixed methodology is used to analyze quantitative data from citizen surveys and qualitative interview responses. Findings affirm that proactive watershed management frameworks are stronger when not prompted by environmental crises. Management programs created reactively with a specific agenda have a comparable structure with citizen involvement but have a limited capacity, scope, and potential for sustained success.

T1  - Ecosystem Service Assessments within the EU Water Framework Directive: Marine Mussel Cultivation as a Controversial Measure
AN  - 2632201327
AB  - To combat the persistent eutrophication in coastal waters, sustainable sea-based measures are recommended. Yet, they are the subject of controversial stakeholder discussion, which hampers the implementation and planning process. The aim of this study is to evaluate if a participatory mapping (PM) approach and ecosystem service assessments (ESA) can be suitable tools within Water Framework Directive (WFD) implementation to support the communication with different target groups to improve and accelerate the planning and realization of new sea-based mitigation measures. We conducted three stakeholder-based PMs to visualize the perception of sea-based mitigation measures in coastal waters and seven different ESAs to investigate the perceptions of different mussel cultivation scenarios as mitigation measures. The PMs showed that ecological measures were preferred. The ESA approach showed that, while experts rated mussel cultivation scenarios positively overall, non-expert stakeholders still seemed skeptical and preferred alternative measures like floating wetlands. The methodological results indicate that PM can be a cost-effective tool to visualize stakeholders’ perceptions, but it needs to be applied with an ESA to be beneficial for the WFD implementation process. A web-based ESA improves the discussion with stakeholders and can reveal potential misperceptions and concerns faster and lead to a more focused discussion.

T1  - An individual-based dataset of carbon and nitrogen isotopic data of Callinectes sapidus in invaded Mediterranean waters
AN  - 2623702065
AB  - Background
The characterisation of functional traits of non-indigenous and invasive species is crucial to assess their impact within invaded habitats. Successful biological invasions are often facilitated by the generalist diet of the invaders which can modify their trophic position and adapt to new ecosystems determining changes in their structure and functioning. Invasive crustaceans are an illustrative example of such mechanisms since their trophic habits can determine important ecological impacts on aquatic food webs. The Atlantic blue crab Callinectes sapidus is currently established and considered invasive in the Mediterranean Sea where it has been recorded for the first time between 1947 and 1949. In the last decade, the blue crab colonised most of the eastern and central Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea and it is currently widening its distribution towards the western region of the basin.
New information
Stable isotope analysis is increasingly used to investigate the trophic habits of invasive marine species. Here, we collated individual measures of the blue crab δ13C and δ15N values and of its potential invertebrate prey into a geo-referenced dataset. The dataset includes 360 records with 236 isotopic values of the blue crab and 224 isotopic data of potential prey collected from five countries and 12 locations between 2014 and 2019. This dataset allows the estimation of the trophic position of the blue crab within a variety of invaded ecosystems, as well as advanced quantitative comparisons of the main features of its isotopic niche.

T1  - Molecular Responses to Thermal and Osmotic Stress in Arctic Intertidal Mussels (Mytilus edulis): The Limits of Resilience
AN  - 2621279352
AB  - Increases in Arctic temperatures have accelerated melting of the Greenland icesheet, exposing intertidal organisms, such as the blue mussel Mytilus edulis, to high air temperatures and low salinities in summer. However, the interaction of these combined stressors is poorly described at the transcriptional level. Comparing expression profiles of M. edulis from experimentally warmed (30 °C and 33 °C) animals kept at control (23‰) and low salinities (15‰) revealed a significant lack of enrichment for Gene Ontology terms (GO), indicating that similar processes were active under all conditions. However, there was a progressive increase in the abundance of upregulated genes as each stressor was applied, with synergistic increases at 33 °C and 15‰, suggesting combined stressors push the animal towards their tolerance thresholds. Further analyses comparing the effects of salinity alone (23‰, 15‰ and 5‰) showed high expression of stress and osmoregulatory marker genes at the lowest salinity, implying that the cell is carrying out intracellular osmoregulation to maintain the cytosol as hyperosmotic. Identification of aquaporins and vacuolar-type ATPase transcripts suggested the cell may use fluid-filled cavities to excrete excess intracellular water, as previously identified in embryonic freshwater mussels. These results indicate that M. edulis has considerable resilience to heat stress and highly efficient mechanisms to acclimatise to lowered salinity in a changing world.

T1  - The update and optimization of an eDNA assay to detect the invasive rusty crayfish (Faxonius rusticus)
AN  - 2588314762
AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) is nuclear or mitochondrial DNA shed into the environment, and amplifying this DNA can serve as a reliable, noninvasive way to monitor aquatic systems for the presence of an invasive species. Assays based on the collection of eDNA are becoming increasingly popular, and, when optimized, can aid in effectively and efficiently tracking invasion fronts. We set out to update an eDNA assay to detect the invasive rusty crayfish, Faxonius rusticus. We tested for species specificity compared to other stream crayfish and field tested the assay at sites with known presence (N = 3) and absence (N = 4) in the Juniata River watershed in central Pennsylvania, USA. To maximize sensitivity, we field tested different storage buffers (Longmire’s buffer and ethanol), DNA extraction methods (Qiagen’s DNEasy and PowerWater kits), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) chemistries (TaqMan and SYBR green). Our assay confirmed the presence data and performed optimally when filter samples were stored in Longmire’s buffer, DNA was extracted with DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit, and TaqMan qPCR chemistry was utilized. With proper sample processing, our assay allows for accurate, noninvasive detection of F. rusticus in streams.

T1  - Seasonality and social factors, but not noise pollution, influence the song characteristics of two leaf warbler species
AN  - 2568584777
AB  - Changes in the acoustic signalling of animals occupying urban ecosystems is often associated with the masking effects of noise pollution, but the way in which they respond to noise pollution is not straightforward. An increasing number of studies indicate that responses can be case specific, and some species have been found to respond differently to high levels of natural versus anthropogenic noise, as well as different levels of the latter. While the perception of noise between species may vary with its source, amplitude and temporal features, some species may possess broader environmental tolerance to noise pollution, as they use higher frequency vocalizations that are less masked by low-frequency urban noise. In this study, we explored the song variation of two closely related leaf warblers, the Common Chiffchaff Phylloscopus collybita and the Willow Warbler Phylloscopus trochilus, inhabiting urban green spaces and nonurban forests. The main goal of our study was to evaluate the impact of moderate levels of noise pollution on the songs of species which use higher frequency vocalizations and large frequency bandwidth. Previous studies found that the Common Chiffchaff modified their song in response to intense noise pollution, while no such data is available for the Willow Warbler. However, the majority of urban green spaces, which serve as wildlife hot spots in urban environments are usually polluted with moderate noise levels, which may not mask the acoustic signals of species that communicate with higher frequency. We analysed the spectral and temporal song parameters of both warblers and described the ambient noise present in males’ territories. Additionally, we looked at the social and seasonal aspects of bird song, since there is more than just noise in urban ecosystems which may affect acoustic communication. We found no evidence for noise-related bird song divergence in either species, however, we showed that social factors, time of day and season influence certain Common Chiffchaff and Willow Warbler song characteristics. Lack of noise-related bird song divergence may be due to the relatively low variation in its amplitude or other noise features present within the song frequency range of the studied species. Similar results have previously been shown for a few songbird species inhabiting urban ecosystems. Although in many cases such results remain in the shadow of the positive ones, they all contribute to a better understanding of animal communication in urban ecosystems.

T1  - Assessing progress in regulation of aquatic nonindigenous species across the multijurisdictional waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes, with emphasis on the live trade pathways
AN  - 2557325010
AB  - The inconsistency in regulated species lists across the shared waters of the Great Lakes undermines the collective prevention efforts of the region, resulting in a “weakest link” problem; some jurisdictions regulate more than 100 species, others fewer than 20. We examine progress over the last twelve years toward more consistent regulated species lists within the 10 Great Lakes jurisdictions. Using a risk assessment framework, we assess a suite of regulated and unregulated organisms that have been identified as having the potential for introduction. Using these species assessments, we determine how sufficient current regulated species lists are in protecting against high-risk species. We also use these species assessments to transparently identify potential high-risk candidates for regional regulatory consideration. A total of 136 aquatic species were regulated by at least one jurisdiction (69 plant species and 67 animal species). The number of species regulated by 5 or more jurisdictions has gone from 10 in 2008 to 44 in 2020. However, the majority (68%) of the currently regulated species are listed in less than half of the Great Lakes jurisdictions. The number of regulated species varies widely across jurisdictions for both taxonomic groups. Wisconsin regulates the largest number of plant and animal species (104 in total), followed by Minnesota (71), New York (59), Illinois/Indiana/Michigan/Ohio (45), Pennsylvania (34), Ontario (23) and Québec (19). We observed only a weak positive correlation between impact score and regulation status. Many of the most-regulated species have impact scores in the low or low-moderate categories, and several species with high impact scores are regulated by less than half of jurisdictions. Twenty-one species (17 plant and 4 animal) are identified as priorities for future regulatory listing.

T1  - Impacts of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) on benthic invertebrate fauna: a case study from the Baltic Sea
AN  - 2564147693
AB  - The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) was first observed in the Baltic Sea in 1990 and has since displayed substantial secondary dispersal, establishing numerous dense populations where they may outcompete native fish and negatively impact prey species. There have been multiple round goby diet studies from both the Baltic Sea and the North American Great Lakes where they are similarly invasive. However, studies that quantify their effects on recipient ecosystems and, specifically, their impacts on the benthic invertebrate macrofauna are rare, particularly from European waters. In this study, we conducted the first before-after study of the potential effects of round goby on benthic invertebrate macrofauna taxa in marine-brackish habitats in Europe, focusing of two sites in the Western Baltic Sea, Denmark. Results were in line with those from the Great Lakes, indicating negative impacts on specific molluscan taxa (e.g. Cardiidae bivalves and Neritidae gastropods, which both showed a fall in detected densities of approximately 98% within the Guldborgsund Strait). In contrast, many other groups appeared to be largely unaffected or even show positive trends following invasion. Round goby gut content data were available at one of our study sites from the period immediately after the invasion. These data confirmed that round goby had in fact been preying on the subset of taxa displaying negative trends.

T1  - Enhancing ecological integrity while preserving ecosystem services: Constructing soft-sediment islands in a shallow lake
AN  - 2890707232
AB  - Ecosystems are increasingly managed to provide multiple benefits to humans, which often degrades their ecological integrity. This strongly applies to aquatic ecosystems, in which engineering can enhance flood protection, drinking water supply, fisheries and recreation. Although these activities typically increase ecosystem functionality to humans, they often impair key aspects of biodiversity and natural functioning.Classical restoration of such degrading freshwater ecosystems can lead to societal opposition, if returning to a former ecosystem state affects previously acquired ecosystem services. Innovative nature-based solutions are therefore needed that enhance natural values in ecosystems, without affecting existing services.We present a large-scale project aiming to increase the ecological integrity of a human-modified freshwater lake while maintaining its services to humans. The freshwater lake Markermeer in the Netherlands was formed by closing off an estuary for flood protection. The ecological integrity of this lake diminished over time, likely because a declining primary productivity impaired biodiversity at higher trophic levels. This decline is associated with a lack of gradual land–water transitions, strong resuspension of fine sediments, low nutrient availability and lack of dynamics typically to be expected in a natural temperate freshwater lake. Restoring the lake to its former marine state would conflict with current ecosystem services.A nature-based solution was initiated in 2016, consisting of constructing a five-island archipelago from the lake's own soft-sediments called the ‘Marker Wadden’. The project aims to increase the lake's primary production by creating gradual land–water transitions, more heterogeneity in water depths and decreasing turbidity by creating shelter and deep sinks reducing fine-sediment resuspension by the wind – thus introducing currently missing elements that are typical for natural lakes. We present the underlying ecological framework and first scientific results of this innovative ongoing project.Within 4 years, the Marker Wadden project shows how forward-looking sustainable development of lake ecosystems using a rewilding approach can enhance natural processes and attract birds and fish, without conflicting with existing ecosystem services. This inspires new directions for halting and reversing the degradation of other vital ecosystems worldwide.

T1  - Economic costs of biological invasions in Ecuador: the importance of the Galapagos Islands
AN  - 2557034289
AB  - Biological invasions, as a result of human intervention through trade and mobility, are the second biggest cause of biodiversity loss. The impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on the environment are well known, however, economic impacts are poorly estimated, especially in mega-diverse countries where both economic and ecological consequences of these effects can be catastrophic. Ecuador, one of the smallest mega-diverse countries, lacks a comprehensive description of the economic costs ofIASwithin its territory. Here, using "InvaCost", a public database that compiles all recorded monetary costs associated withIASfrom English and Non-English sources, we investigated the economic costs of biological invasions. We found that between 1983 and 2017, the reported costs associated with biological invasions ranged between US$86.17 million (when considering only the most robust data) and US$626 million (when including all cost data) belonging to 37 species and 27 genera. Furthermore, 99% of the recorded cost entries were from the Galapagos Islands. From only robust data, the costliest identified taxonomic group was feral goats (Capra hircus; US$20 million), followed by Aedes mosquitoes (US$2.14 million) while organisms like plant species from the genus Rubus, a parasitic fly (Philornis downsi), black rats (Rattus rattus) and terrestrial gastropods (Achatina fulica) represented less than US$2 million each. Costs of "mixed-taxa" (i.e. plants and animals) represented the highest (61% of total robust costs; US$52.44 million). The most impacted activity sector was the national park authorities, which spent about US$84 million. Results from robust data also revealed that management expenditures were the major type of costs recorded in the Galapagos Islands; however, costs reported for medical losses related to Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue fever in mainland Ecuador would have ranked first if more detailed information had allowed us to categorize them as robust data. Over 70% of theIASreported for Ecuador did not have reported costs. These results suggest that costs reported here are a massive underestimate of the actual economic toll of invasions in the country.

T1  - Paddlefish, Polyodon spathula: Historical, current status and future aquaculture prospects in Russia
AN  - 2623056180
AB  - In the wild, overfishing, habitat loss, industrial and agriculture activity has led to the degradation of freshwater habitats and, therefore, dramatically declines the Mississippi paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) stocks (Stone 2007). Paddlefish gain a growing commercial interest in the USSR/Russian Federation due to its ability to produce high-quality caviar. Also, it can be reared in polyculture ponds and a wide range of temperate reservoirs. Therefore, aquaculture of these valuable fish is necessary to meet consumer demand in Eastern European markets with flesh and caviar. Published information about the culture of paddlefish in the USSR/Russian Federation is scarce and not permanently available. Regarding our study, data were collected from English reports and translated Russian official statistics and studies. Also, FAO fisheries data from 1880 up to 2010 for paddleﬁsh were included. Moreover, caviar production data and prices were surveyed from companies. The collected data could briefly represent the historical and current status of paddlefish aquaculture and provide insight into the expected future production in the Russian Federation. Besides, it investigates the drawbacks of paddlefish aquaculture development and the potential challenges in Russian territories. Also, it discusses potential impacts related to the preservation of the breeding stocks, population naturalization and invasiveness of the species in the southern parts of Russia (i.e., in the Volga‐Caspian basin): Saratov, Rostov, Astrakhan Oblast and Krasnodar regions. Furthermore, this review aimed to gather the available data and the latest final findings that may address the welfare of paddlefish data to fill the knowledge gap towards improving the management of this species. In addition, future development prospects can be supported by government oversight through accurate accounting and financing for private farm activity.

T1  - Hydropeaking intensity and dam proximity limit aquatic invertebrate diversity in the Colorado River Basin
AN  - 2593292863
AB  - River biodiversity is threatened globally by hydropower dams, and there is a need to understand how dam management favors certain species while filtering out others. We examined aquatic invertebrate communities within the tailwaters 0–24 km downstream of seven large hydropower dams in the Colorado River Basin of the western United States. We quantified aquatic invertebrate dominance, richness, abundance, and biomass at multiple locations within individual tailwaters and across the basin and identified biological community responses associated with dam operations and distance from dam. We found that each tailwater was dominated by 3–7 invertebrate taxa, accounting for 95% of total abundance. Half of these dominant taxa were non‐insect, non‐flying species and thus were unavailable to terrestrial consumers. Consistent with previous studies, aquatic insects and sensitive taxa were negatively associated with hydropeaking intensity (magnitude of daily flow fluctuations associated with hydropower generation), which limits the composition and potentially the quality of the invertebrate food base. While total invertebrate abundance and biomass did not change with increasing distance downstream from dams, insect and sensitive taxa richness, abundance, and biomass all increased, suggesting that impacts of hydropeaking are most acute immediately downstream of dams. Our results demonstrate that tailwaters experiencing hydropeaking support high abundances of aquatic invertebrate, but the diversity of these communities is low.

T1  - Freezing mortality of faucet snails, Bithynia tentaculata: a viable method for equipment decontamination to reduce aquatic invasive species spread
AN  - 2520686529
AB  - Reliable, inexpensive, and publicly accessible decontamination techniques are needed for equipment used in waters infested with aquatic invasive species. One such aquatic invasive species is the faucet snail (Bithynia tentaculata) that hosts several parasitic trematodes which have caused mass waterfowl die-offs in the United States and Canada. We examined freezing as a potential decontamination method using a household chest freezer. Snails were frozen in time increments of 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min in dry conditions (water removed) and in water. Snails in dry conditions reached 100% mortality after 30 min while snails in water reached 80% mortality after 240 min. Snail mortality was inversely related to size, with larger snails requiring longer times to achieve mortality. Snails in water could tolerate freezing temperatures longer than snails in dry conditions. We determined that freezing is a viable decontamination method for contaminated equipment, but longer freezing times will be necessary for larger snails, especially when equipment is wet.

T1  - Eight years of BioInvasions Records: patterns and trends in alien and cryptogenic species records
AN  - 2520686124
AB  - “BioInvasions Records” (BIR) is an international journal founded in 2011, with its primary focus the publication of new records of non-native species. We analyzed all published articles in BIR between 2012 and 2019, aiming to: make all georeferenced records openly available; investigate spatio-temporal patterns in reported records, methodologies for species identification, and pathways of invasion; and identify possible biases in reporting alien species occurrences and distributions. In total, 10457 georeferenced records were retrieved from 467 published articles, reporting 628 different species. Terrestrial species were under-represented in the dataset. Chordata dominated in the list of reported species, followed by Arthropoda, Mollusca, and Tracheophyta. Europe was the continent with most recorded species, followed by North America. In terms of species reported by country, USA ranked on top. This geographic bias is in accordance with global patterns of research output, related to the fact that North America and Western Europe are leaders in funding research and development, and this is where the majority of highly ranked universities are situated. The country diversity of reported species exhibited an increasing trend from 28 countries in 2012 to 49 countries in 2019. Single-author papers represented only ~ 5% of all published papers, and the median number of authors has increased from 3 in 2012–2013, to 4 in 2015–2019, following global trends of increased collaborations. The frequency of conducting molecular analyses for species identification has increased from 4.5% of published articles in 2012 to 25.2% in 2019, and is expected to further increase with the continuing development of molecular tools, in particular rapid advances and cost reduction in eDNA, next-generation sequencing, barcoding and metabarcoding analyses. The most common pathway of introduction (based on the CBD classification) was “transport-stowaway”, followed by “escape from confinement” and “corridor”. However, the importance of pathways significantly differed by environment. “Transport-stowaway” was the most important pathway for marine and transitional species, whereas “escape from confinement” was the most important pathway for terrestrial and freshwater species. The most important CBD pathway subcategory was “ship/boat ballast water”, followed by “interconnected waterways/basins/seas”, “natural dispersal across borders”, “ship/boat hull fouling”, “aquaculture/mariculture”, and “pet/aquarium/terrarium species (including live food for such species)”. BIR has provided the means for publishing valuable information on the distribution of alien species, the dynamics of invasions, and pathways of introduction, therefore substantially supporting invasion science and management.

T1  - ­Blue mussel (Mytilus spp.) cultivation in mesohaline eutrophied inner coastal waters: mitigation potential, threats and cost effectiveness
AN  - 2529596389
AB  - The EU-water framework directive (WFD) focuses on nutrient reductions to return coastal waters to the good ecological status. As of today, many coastal waters have reached a steady state of insufficient water quality due to continuous external nutrient inputs and internal loadings. This study focuses first on the current environmental status of mesohaline inner coastal waters to illustrate their needs of internal measures to reach demanded nutrient reductions and secondly, if mussel cultivation can be a suitable strategy to improve water quality. Therefore, nitrogen, phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and Secchi depth of nine mesohaline inner coastal waters in north east Germany were analyzed from 1990 to 2018. Two pilot mussel farms were used to evaluate their effectiveness as a mitigation measure and to estimate potential environmental risks, including the interactions with pathogenic vibrio bacteria. Further, estimated production and mitigation potential were used to assess economic profitability based on the sale of small sized mussels for animal feed and a compensation for nutrient mitigation. The compensation costs were derived from nutrient removal costs of a waste water treatment plant (WWTP). Results show that currently all nine water bodies do not reach the nutrient thresholds demanded by the WFD. However, coastal waters differ in nutrient pollution, indicating that some can reach the desired threshold values if internal measures are applied. The mitigation potential of mussel cultivation depends on the amount of biomass that is cultivated and harvested. However, since mussel growth is closely coupled to the salinity level, mussel cultivation in low saline environments leads to lower biomass production and inevitably to larger cultivation areas. If 50% of the case study area Greifswald Bay was covered with mussel farms the resulting nitrogen reduction would increase Secchi depth by 7.8 cm. However, high chlorophyll a values can hamper clearance rates (<20 mg m−3 = 0.43 l h−1 dry weight g−1) and therefore the mitigation potential. Also, the risk of mussel stock loss due to high summer water temperatures might affect the mitigation potential. The pilot farms had no significant effect on the total organic content of sediments beneath. However, increased values of Vibrio spp. in bio deposits within the pilot farm (1.43 106 ± 1.10 106CFU 100 ml−1 (reference site: 1.04 106 ± 1.45 106 CFU 100 ml−1) were measured with sediment traps. Hence, mussel farms might act as a sink for Vibrio spp. in systems with already high vibrio concentrations. However, more research is required to investigate the risks of Vibrio occurrence coupled to mussel farming. The economic model showed that mussel cultivation in environments below 12 PSU cannot be economic at current market prices for small size mussels and compensations based on nutrient removal cost of WWTPs.

T1  - Ecophysiological responses of two closely related epigean and hypogean Niphargus species to hypoxia and increased temperature: Do they differ?
AN  - 2539313688
AB  - Ecological performance of animals depends on physiological and biochemical processes that are adjusted to the environment. The responses to hypoxia or anoxia have been frequently studied in subterranean aquatic organisms in order to find potential adaptations to restrict oxygen conditions occurring in the underground habitats. However, some previous studies have compared phylogenetic distant epigean and hypogean species or the epigean and hypogean populations of the same species due to little chance to compare closely related epigean and hypogean species. Therefore, in this study, we compared the effects of exposure to hypoxia, followed by reoxygenation, and increased temperature on oxygen consumption, potential metabolic activity, and antioxidant activities in closely related epigean and hypogean species: Niphargus zagrebensis and N. stygius. Oxygen consumption of N. stygius increased similarly during post-hypoxic recovery at 10 and 20°C (approx. 5-times), while N. zagrebensis increased its oxygen consumption for 9.7 and 4.4-times at 10 and 20°C, respectively. We observed higher exploitation of metabolic potential for current oxygen consumption during reoxygenation in N. zagrebensis than N. stygius. Exposure to hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation at 20°C increased catalase (CAT) activity in N. stygius, but not in N. zagrebensis. We observed increased glutathione reductase activity in both Niphargus species. We concluded that respiratory and antioxidant responses to severe hypoxia and increased temperature differed between closely related epigean and hypogean Niphargus species. Hypogean Niphargus species possess physiological and biochemical characteristics that are advantageous in temperature stable subterranean environments which support inhabiting of species that have low energetic demands, while epigean Niphargus species can successfully inhabit specific surface habitats.

T1  - Finding of nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus (Cichliformes: Cichlidae) in Georgia, the South Caucasus
AN  - 2535563409
AB  - Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758) is a fish from the family Cichlidae, native to Sub-Saharan Africa. Nile tilapia is one of the most cultured freshwater fish species worldwide and because of its commercial value and well-developed aquaculture technologies, it has been introduced to many countries. Nile tilapia also has become invasive in areas of suitable climate when escaped from aquaculture facilities to the wild. Georgia is the country in the Ponto-Caspian region situated on the southern slopes of the Great Caucasus eastwards from the Black Sea coast. Due to its very variable landscape, the climate of Georgia fluctuates from cold mountainous to humid subtropical type. Here we present the finding of Oreochromis niloticus in freshwaters of eastern Georgia for the first time, with the discussion of risk assessment with the climate suitability for potential establishment.

T1  - Testing ecological theories in the Anthropocene: alteration of succession by an invasive marine species
AN  - 2519261770
AB  - Ecologists employ a diverse body of theory to help explain patterns and processes in ecological systems, with the consistency of ecological theories tested against an increasingly altered world. The global redistribution of species is a prominent impact of climate change and human‐mediated biological invasions and often results in negative impacts to ecosystems. Recently, a species of colonial tunicate not previously present, Clavelina oblonga, has become prominent within the marine fouling community of Beaufort, North Carolina, USA. Fifty years ago, researchers tested theories of ecological succession developed in terrestrial systems and found that this marine community was characterized by a heterogeneous mixture of species that varied inter‐annually (i.e., multiple community states) and increased in diversity over time. A recent follow‐up study found that the fouling community is dominated by C. oblonga with patterns of community development and structure that led to the loss of alternative community states, domination by C. oblonga, and reduced species diversity. The present study addressed the question: Will patterns of community development identified over 50 yr ago still operate under reduced cover of invasive C. oblonga? This study also quantified the impacts of two large‐scale environmental disturbances (extremely cold winter and hurricane) on the abundance of C. oblonga and the resulting fouling community. Clavelina oblonga remains a dominant component of the fouling community due to its rapid growth and strong seasonal recruitment. Under conditions of reduced percent cover of C. oblonga, the local fouling community displayed unique community states that became even more distinct over time, consistent with the pattern of multiple community states identified by researchers over 50 yr ago, and that were dependent upon date of disturbance. Natural disturbances in this study caused by a harsh winter and a hurricane greatly reduced the presence of C. oblonga. This experiment advanced our understanding of marine community ecology by testing whether the concept of multiple community states identified over 50 yr ago is still operable in the absence of invasive C. oblonga, and highlights how natural environment disturbances can potentially moderate the spread of this invasive tunicate.

T1  - Novel tools and best practices for education about invasive alien species
AN  - 2508038983
AB  - Increasing public awareness is a prerequisite for successful management of invasive alien species (IAS). Environmental education can play an important role in this process by providing relevant learning outcomes and experiences for youth and students, as well as professionals in different sectors associated with introduction pathways or who are involved in mitigation and eradication of IAS. This paper responds to the urgent call for the inclusion of the IAS topic in education through the development, implementation and evaluation of novel and user-friendly educational materials. The aim of this paper is to describe best practices in IAS education and to share the lessons learned from eight educational projects from seven different countries. We discuss four challenges for IAS education, related to (1) inconsistent and ambiguous terminology, (2) communicating risk, (3) implementation of education materials, and (4) evaluation of learning effects. Examples of best practices are the use of smartphone applications and gaming elements, place-based education and exhibitions. We also note the importance of open access publishing of education materials to make them easily available. We intend this discussion to serve as a source of inspiration to researchers, science communicators and teachers and to spur the development of new teaching materials worldwide.

T1  - A framework for lotic macrosystem research
AN  - 2492785293
AB  - We analyze here the nature of research in freshwater macrosystem biology (especially lotic studies) from both conceptual and current research perspectives. The boundaries of permanent and transitional lotic macrosystems from the smallest to largest spatial extents are described. We contrast ecosystem vs. macrosystem research and macroecology vs. macrosystems ecology and provide some examples of representative aquatic macrosystems ecology projects in the USA. We recommend approaches for incorporating certain large‐scale lotic concepts developed over the last 40 yr as the bases for lotic macrosystem studies. Of these, the three most appropriate in chronological order are the River Continuum Concept, the Riverine Ecosystem Synthesis, and the Stream Biome Gradient Concept. Four other concepts would be suitable for testing macrosystem hypotheses after incorporating small to large conceptual or geographic expansions of the models. We suggest future research directions in lotic macrosystem research in areas of climate change and teleconnections among distant organisms and systems and include general recommendations for conducting macrosystem‐level research.

T1  - Control and Management of Ballast Water on Commercial Ships
AN  - 2769619126
AB  - Following the industrialization and development of world economies, pollution factors which endanger the environment have increased to an alarming degree. Therefore, various measures have been proposed and taken by local, national and global authorities to remedy and control pollution and ecological balance. One of these measures taken worldwide to limit and prevent environmental disasters, was the decision proposed and approved by the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) at IMO (International Marine Organization) Convention in 2004 by the Ballast Water Management (BWM) Convention. Basically, new rules have been introduced on the control and management of ballast water of commercial ships. The paper presents aspects on how to control and manage ballast water in some types of commercial ships.

T1  - Microplastics in White Sucker (Catostomus Commersonii) and Common Carp (Cyprinus Carpio) from the Upper Thames River, Ontario
AN  - 2714870091
AB  - Microplastics (plastic particles < 5 mm) are abundant in aquatic environments, particularly near urban areas. Little is known, however, about how variation in microplastic abundances within watersheds affects fishes. Microplastics were examined in demersal fishes—white sucker (Catostomus commersonii) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio)—across 11 sites in the Thames River, Ontario. Microplastics were found in 44% of white sucker, ranging from 0-14 particles per fish, and 31% of common carp, ranging from 0-128 particles per fish. Across both species, the number of microplastics in fish was higher in urban sites than rural sites, and there was a positive relationship between the number of microplastics in the fish and the abundance of microplastics in the sediment. Body mass was also positively related to number of microplastics in fish. Together these results provide insight into environmental and biological factors that may be influencing the variation of microplastic ingestion in demersal river fishes.

T1  - The Enterocytozoonidae: The Emergence of a Microsporidian Clade into the Aquatic and Terrestrial Food-chain
AN  - 2659784955
AB  - Pathogens of livestock have proven to be a major concern, in terms of human health, economic sustainability and food availability. They have been shown to be a limiting factor in regard to these three factors and, as such, will become a growing problem as the global population continues to expand. Controlling and predicting pathogen outbreaks is vital to the sustained growth of populations and has become an important topic of study. However, it is a complex process with a multitude of varying factors, that cannot be solved through one method.A specific family of Microsporidia, the Enterocytozoonidae, has received a lot of attention in regard to their effect on human health and aquaculture. Enterocytozoonids are largely found in marine environments and mainly infect aquatic hosts. Many of the organisms infected by enterocytozoonids are economically important to aquaculture, with a number infecting wild-caught fish and farmed crustacea. Two species, in particular, have received a lot of academic and medical attention, Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei. However, the family as a whole is understudied and the diversity described is hypothesised not to be a true representation of the family’s diversity or distribution.The aim of this thesis is to assess the potential risk the Enterocytozoonidae have on aquaculture. This has been done in three different ways: i) it described and catalogued the current diversity and distribution in South West UK estuaries and a greater spatial scale using metagenomic databases, ii) using population genomics, it investigates the biogeography of, E. hepatopenaei, a pathogen of two shrimp (Penaeus vannamei and Penaeus monodon) widely farmed in South East Asia, with the aim to infer transmission routes into shrimp ponds, iii) and lastly, it investigated the loss and gain of orthogroups within the Enterocytozoonidae associated with the lineage wide host-shift to aquatic host from terrestrial hosts.Overall, this thesis found a greater distribution and abundance for Enterospora canceri and E. hepatopenaei in the locations sampled, and greater diversity within the Enterocytozoondiae than was previously described. Suggesting an alternative host (s) for En. canceri, likely planktonic crustacea, as prevalence in the current described host was very low (3%). Use of metagenomic databases in this study also expanded upon the known distribution and diversity of the Enterocytozoonidae, showing a largely marine-based distribution. Suggesting an Atlantic-based radiation. It found that E. hepatopenaei is likely to be endemic to the countries examined, due to strong geographic signals. However, analysis suggests some transmission between Thailand India and China. Lastly, it identified candidate genes, unique to lineages within the Enterocytozoonidae, that could contribute to the family’s success in the invasion of their respective host cells.A greater diversity and abundance for novel sequences more related to the Enterocytozoon/Enterospora branch of the Enterocytozoondiae was also observed, suggesting, at least in estuaries in the Southwest of the United Kingdom, that this clade may be more diverse. Possibly due to their described main hosts being planktonic crustaceans. Which may lend to the success of the two most prevalent species in the family, E. hepatopenaei and E. bieneusi.This study found that the Enterocytozoonidae likely pose a continued threat to aquatic livestock, largely due to their widespread nature, overlapping with human influenced environments, and evident opportunistic propensity to host-shift. In addition, also being present inland in freshwater makes preventative measures difficult, as they could be found in a range of water sources.

T1  - Reinforcement of Environmental DNA Based Methods (Sensu Stricto) in Biodiversity Monitoring and Conservation: A Review
AN  - 2612738239
AB  - Simple SummaryWorldwide biodiversity loss points to a necessity of upgrading to a fast and effective monitoring method that can provide quick conservation action. Newly developed environmental DNA (eDNA) based method found to be more cost-effective, non-invasive, quick, and accurate than traditional monitoring (spot identification, camera trapping). Although the eDNA based methods are proliferating rapidly, as a newly developed branch, it needs more standardization and practitioner adaptation. The present study aims to evaluate the eDNA based methods, and their potential achievements in biodiversity monitoring, and conservation for quick practitioners’ adaption. The investigation shows that the eDNA technique is applicable largely in (i) early detection of invasive species, (ii) species detection for conservation, (iii) community-level biodiversity monitoring, (iv) ecosystem health monitoring, (v) study on trophic interactions, etc. Thus, the eDNA technique shows a great promise with its high accuracy and authenticity, and will be applicable alone or alongside other methods in the near future.AbstractRecently developed non-invasive environmental DNA-based (eDNA) techniques have enlightened modern conservation biology, propelling the monitoring/management of natural populations to a more effective and efficient approach, compared to traditional surveys. However, due to rapid-expansion of eDNA, confusion in terminology and collection/analytical pipelines can potentially jeopardize research progression, methodological standardization, and practitioner adoption in several ways. Present investigation reflects the developmental progress of eDNA (sensu stricto) including highlighting the successful case studies in conservation management. The eDNA technique is successfully relevant in several areas of conservation research (invasive/conserve species detection) with a high accuracy and authentication, which gradually upgrading modern conservation approaches. The eDNA technique related bioinformatics (e.g., taxon-specific-primers MiFish, MiBird, etc.), sample-dependent methodology, and advancement of sequencing technology (e.g., oxford-nanopore-sequencing) are helping in research progress. The investigation shows that the eDNA technique is applicable largely in (i) early detection of invasive species, (ii) species detection for conservation, (iii) community level biodiversity monitoring, (iv) ecosystem health monitoring, (v) study on trophic interactions, etc. Thus, the eDNA technique with a high accuracy and authentication can be applicable alone or coupled with traditional surveys in conservation biology. However, a comprehensive eDNA-based monitoring program (ecosystem modeling and function) is essential on a global scale for future management decisions.

T1  - MONITORING OF MACROINVERTEBRATES ALONG STREAMS OF BILAH RIVER, NORTH SUMATRA, INDONESIA
AN  - 2606936159
AB  - The present study reports the first comprehensive study on the freshwater macroinvertebrates and its habitat preferences in Bilah River, the largest river in the Northern Sumatra. The riverside is characterized by the presence of anthropogenic and industrial activities which may alter the macroinvertebrate assemblage and biodiversity. Five months of investigation on 10 sampling stations from December 2016 to October 2017 were conducted based on the river flow in Bilah River. Principal component analysis indicated a decrease of trophic status from upstream to downstream of the river. A total of 27 taxa were recorded, with the most abundant group were members of Odonata, Gastropoda, and Decapoda. The highest density of macroinvertebrate was observed from station 1 (160 ind'm'2), while the lowest density was observed from station 9 (38.64 ind'm2). Based on species distribution and similarity, two groups of habitats may be distinctively recognized based on the Bray-curtis similarity coefficient. Group 1 consisted of station 1, 2, 3 and 4 while group 2 consisted of station 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Based on the diversity indices as ecological parameters, the habitat condition in Bilah River was categorized from low to moderately polluted. Spatial patterns in both environmental conditions affecting the macroinvertebrate assemblage was observed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed the preferences from each macroinvertebrate species towards environmental conditions.

T1  - Iron, Phosphorus and Trace Elements in Mussels’ Shells, Water, and Bottom Sediments from the Severnaya Dvina and the Onega River Basins (Northwestern Russia)
AN  - 2602203186
AB  - Trace elements in freshwater bivalve shells are widely used for reconstructing long-term changes in the riverine environments. However, Northern Eurasian regions, notably the European Russian North, susceptible to strong environmental impact via both local pollution and climate warming, are poorly studied. This work reports new data on trace elements accumulation by widespread species of freshwater mussels Unio spp. and Anodonta anatina in the Severnaya Dvina and the Onega River Basin, the two largest subarctic river basins in the Northeastern Europe. We revealed that iron and phosphorous accumulation in Unio spp. and Anodonta anatina shells have a strong relationship with a distance from the mouth of the studied river (the Severnaya Dvina). Based on multiparametric statistics comprising chemical composition of shells, water, and sediments, we demonstrated that the accumulation of elements in the shell depends on the environment of the biotope. Differences in the elemental composition of shells between different taxa are associated with ecological preferences of certain species to the substrate. The results set new constraints for the use of freshwater mussels’ shells for monitoring riverine environments and performing paleo-reconstructions.

T1  - Molecular species delimitation refines the taxonomy of native and nonnative physinine snails in North America
AN  - 2593745044
AB  - Being able to associate an organism with a scientific name is fundamental to our understanding of its conservation status, ecology, and evolutionary history. Gastropods in the subfamily Physinae have been especially troublesome to identify because morphological variation can be unrelated to interspecific differences and there have been widespread introductions of an unknown number of species, which has led to a speculative taxonomy. To resolve uncertainty about species diversity in North America, we targeted an array of single-locus species delimitation methods at publically available specimens and new specimens collected from the Snake River basin, USA to generate species hypotheses, corroborated using nuclear analyses of the newly collected specimens. A total-evidence approach delineated 18 candidate species, revealing cryptic diversity within recognized taxa and a lack of support for other named taxa. Hypotheses regarding certain local endemics were confirmed, as were widespread introductions, including of an undescribed taxon likely belonging to a separate genus in southeastern Idaho for which the closest relatives are in southeast Asia. Overall, single-locus species delimitation was an effective first step toward understanding the diversity and distribution of species in Physinae and to guiding future investigation sampling and analyses of species hypotheses.

AN  - 2593006654
AB  - The Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) is an invader species, and its distribution is continuously on the increase. Today its expansion has spread to the American continent. In this study we describe the effects of the urban environment on the Eurasian collared dove in eastern Spain. The abundance and presence of this dove were analyzed in 46 localities using counting points. Overall, 220-point counts were surveyed between autumn 2015 and late-winter 2016. A hierarchical partitioning analysis was used to identify explanatory variables of different types such as resources, climate and urban structure, and human presence, which may influence the presence and abundance of this species. In the case of presence, the number of town inhabitants, parks, mean minimum temperature, exotic vegetation and schools had a positive association, while pedestrian number and restaurants had a negative association. Abundance was positively related to native vegetation, exotic vegetation, and water, while urban area was negatively associated with it. Exotic vegetation was the only variable that has a positive relation to presence and abundance. These results can help to predict the use of urban habitats in potential localities for its invasion. Alternate abstract: La tórtola turca (Streptopelia decaocto) es una especie invasora y su ámbito de distribución aumenta continuamente. Hoy en día, su expansión incluye el continente americano. En este estudio se describen los efectos que el ambiente urbano tiene sobre la tórtola turca en el este de España. Se muestrearon 46 localidades mediante puntos de conteo. La abundancia de la tórtola turca fue evaluada en 220 puntos de conteo entre otoño de 2015 y finales de invierno 2016. Se utilizó el análisis de partición jerárquica para identificar variables explicativas como recursos, clima y estructura urbana, y presencia humana, que pueden influir en su presencia y abundancia. En el caso de la presencia de la especie, el número de habitantes de la ciudad, parques, temperatura media, vegetación exótica y colegios tuvieron una asociación positiva, mientras que el número de peatones y los restaurantes estuvieron negativamente asociados. La abundancia estuvo positivamente relacionada con la vegetación nativa, vegetación exótica y el agua, mientras que la zona urbana estuvo negativamente asociada. Estos resultados pueden predecir el uso de hábitats urbanos en localidades potenciales para su invasión.

T1  - The Impact of Nautical Activities on the Environment—A Systematic Review of Research
AN  - 2581053567
AB  - As nautical tourism and recreational activities involving boats have become highly popular, research interest on various effects of nautical tourism is also increasing. This paper aims to analyze the main scientific contributions in the field of nautical tourism and its impact on the environment. The focus of the analysis is on the methods used to estimate and model recreational boating activities. Since nautical tourism plays a crucial role in the context of the growth and development of the economy, it is necessary to consider the environmental component of its development. The background objective of the paper is to provide a representation of environmental descriptors, i.e., to highlight in particular the environmental impact of nautical tourism. A search on the Web of Science Core Collection, touching on this topic, is composed of scientific papers published in the period 2010–2021. The papers examined are divided into five categories according to the impact of nautical tourism they study: Environmental, Economic, Social, Technical or Other. The results show that most papers were published in the area of environmental impacts of nautical tourism, with most papers examining invasive species, antifouling and impacts on species. The analysis showed that the negative impacts were mainly studied individually. Based on the analysis and evaluation of the scientific publications, a basic recommendation is given for the construction of a model to estimate recreational boating activities and its impact on the environment.

T1  - Filter Feeding and Carbon and Nitrogen Assimilation of a Freshwater Bivalve (Unio douglasiae) on a Toxic Cyanobacterium (Microcystis aeruginosa)
AN  - 2580956037
AB  - We investigated the possible intake of toxic cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) as a nutrient resource for a filter-feeder bivalve (Unio douglasiae) based on the measurement of feeding and assimilation rates of carbon and nitrogen in a limited space with no current for 72 h using 13C and 15N dual isotope tracers. With high clearance rates, the unionid rapidly removed Microcystis cells within 24 h, but only a small amount of carbon and nitrogen were incorporated into the tissues. Even with the low assimilation rates, the mussels showed more favorable uptake of carbon than of nitrogen from toxic Microcystis water, and of tissues, the gills and gut accumulated more carbon and nitrogen than the muscle and mantle. Collectively, our findings indicate that although Unio douglasiae effectively uptake toxic Microcystis cells, they can assimilate only low amounts of nutrients into tissues within three days, despite a non-flowing system.

AN  - 2577690287
AB  - Ecological safety of water intakes in urban water management systems and the creation of comfortable living conditions for people can be ensured only with a comprehensive solution to the problems associated with improving water quality when it is taken from the source, preserving biodiversity in the water body, protecting against blue-green algae, zebra mussel and mechanical pollution. The water intake technological complex as a part of the natural-technical system (NTS) specialized type “Natural water environment - Urban water management complex - Urban water supply system” (“NWE - UWMC - UWSC”), as the main multifactorial technogenic component, includes various types of hydraulic structures and protective devices interconnection, interaction and relationship (IIR), which ensure the environmental safety (ES) of the urban economy. The studies have established that the functional IIR between the structural elements of the “UWMC” in the composition of this NTS type “NWE – UWMC - UWSC” determines the generalized design and technological solutions, which determine the complex of protective measures to ensure the ES preservation of health and the urban population life quality. Based on the results of complex (theoretical, laboratory, full-scale) studies, constructive and technological solutions have been developed to preserve the diversity of ichthyofauna (juvenile fish, etc.) in the water body, to ensure the protection of the water intake bucket from bottom and suspended sediments, sludge and floating objects coming from the water body, from toxic blue-green algae and fouling with zebra mussel of structural elements and technological equipment as part of the urban water management complex. Functional sequence of IIR structural and technological solutions (STS-1, STS-2, STS-3) between themselves (Fig. 1) provides regulatory requirements for environmental safety.

T1  - An Acoustic Treatment to Mitigate the Effects of the Apple Snail on Agriculture and Natural Ecosystems
AN  - 2576449014
AB  - Global change is the origin of increased occurrence of disturbance events in natural communities, with biological invasions constituting a major threat to ecosystem integrity and functioning. The apple snail (Pomacea maculata) is a freshwater gastropod mollusk from South America. Considered one of the 100 most harmful invasive species in the world, due to its voracity, resistance, and high reproductive rate, it has become a global problem for wetland crops. In Catalonia, it has affected the rice fields of the Ebre Delta since 2010 with significant negative impact on the local economy. As a gastropod mollusc it possesses statocysts consisting of a pair of sacs, one located on each side of the foot, that contain multiple calcium carbonate statoconia. This study shows the first ultrastructural images of pathological changes in the sensory epithelium of the statocyst of apple snail adults with an increase in the severity of the lesions over time after exposure to low frequency sounds. Sound-induced damage to the statocyst could likely result in an inhibition of its vital functions resulting in a potential reduction in the survival ability of the apple snail and lead to an effective mitigation method for reducing damage to rice fields.

T1  - Lake Users’ Perceptions of Environmental Change: Ecosystem Services and Disservices Associated with Aquatic Plants
AN  - 2539998069
AB  - Lake Léman (Lake Geneva), Switzerland, is known to have undergone major environmental change over the last few decades, including changes in the abundance, distribution, and species composition of macrophytic plants (aquatic plants). In this study, questionnaires and key informant interviews were used to assess lake users’ perceptions of broad scale environmental change in the lake paying special attention tochanges in the abundance of aquatic plants and the perceived ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem disservices (EDS) associated with them. In addition, we assessed whether users’ perceptions of aquatic plants had an impact on perceived management need. Most respondents (63%) perceived aquatic plant abundance to have increased over the last 10 years, primarily because of climate change. Aquatic plants were seen to benefit water quality through improved regulation and supporting services, and to provide important habitat and food for fauna. Most EDS associated with increased aquatic plant abundance were categorized as cultural or economic. User perceptions of the ES and EDS associated with aquatic plants affected support for management (60% of respondents supported some form of management), and such information is important for informing environmental decision making.

T1  - Discovery of Siderophore and Metallophore Production in the Aerobic Anoxygenic Phototrophs
AN  - 2532183284
AB  - Aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs have been isolated from a rich variety of environments including marine ecosystems, freshwater and meromictic lakes, hypersaline springs, and biological soil crusts, all in the hopes of understanding their ecological niche. Over 100 isolates were chosen for this study, representing 44 species from 27 genera. Interactions with Fe3+ and other metal(loid) cations such as Mg2+, V3+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Se4+ and Te2+ were tested using a chromeazurol S assay to detect siderophore or metallophore production, respectively. Representatives from 20 species in 14 genera of α-Proteobacteria, or 30% of strains, produced highly diffusible siderophores that could bind one or more metal(loid)s, with activity strength as follows: Fe > Zn > V > Te > Cu > Mn > Mg > Se > Ni > Co. In addition, γ-proteobacterial Chromocurvus halotolerans, strain EG19 excreted a brown compound into growth medium, which was purified and confirmed to act as a siderophore. It had an approximate size of ~341 Da and drew similarities to the siderophore rhodotorulic acid, a member of the hydroxamate group, previously found only among yeasts. This study is the first to discover siderophore production to be widespread among the aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs, which may be another key method of metal(loid) chelation and potential detoxification within their environments.

T1  - People’s Environmental Stewardship Elements Framed Through Sense of Place
AN  - 2531295141
AB  - Indianapolis, Indiana is a sprawling city making it an exceptional locale to pursue environmental learning and stewardship research, particularly in the urban context. To achieve improved understanding of people’s attitudes and behaviors towards their natural environment and resources, research was conducted on different local populations of Indianapolis and surrounding metropolitan area. The research’s overall aim was to provide greater insight through sense of place on environmental perceptions and actions. The studied subpopulations included families, community members, and young adults and utilized mixed methods to frame inquiry. The qualitative and quantitative data approaches, such as survey instruments and semi-structured interviews, provided multiple avenues of results that could be corroborated to strengthen and confirm outcomes. Each project investigated how people perceive their responsibilities and participate in aspects that are important to environmental sustainability while also identifying potential driving mechanisms for their current and potential behaviors. Extant literature proposes that sense of place can affect a number of dimensions including people’s environmental intentions and behaviors. The context of each project considered how sense of place theory intertwined within the outcomes of environmental stewardship. Environmental stewardship is an important means for providing remediation and mitigation, as well as cultivating an ecologically responsible society. Families showed critical overlap in greater environmental awareness and action when topics were near respective residences and immediate surroundings, while informal interaction and formal intervention outlined how consequential messaging and experiential aspects can be when connecting people to resources or areas that are not considered home or familiar. The research suggests conclusive evidence on how to inform and guide on effective modes for producing environmental awareness, knowledge, and stewardship in order to build a more sustainable future.

T1  - Decoupling salinity and carbonate chemistry: low calcium ion concentration rather than salinity limits calcification in Baltic Sea mussels
AN  - 2516163345
AB  - The Baltic Sea has a salinity gradient decreasing from fully marine (> 25) in the west to below 7 in the central Baltic Proper. Habitat-forming and ecologically dominant mytilid mussels exhibit decreasing growth when salinity < 11; however, the mechanisms underlying reduced calcification rates in dilute seawater are not fully understood. Both [HCO3-] and [Ca2+] also decrease with salinity, challenging calcifying organisms through CaCO3 undersaturation (Ω≤1) and unfavourable ratios of calcification substrates ([Ca2+] and [HCO3-]) to the inhibitor (H+), expressed as the extended substrate–inhibitor ratio (ESIR). This study combined in situ monitoring of three southwest Baltic mussel reefs with two laboratory experiments to assess how various environmental conditions and isolated abiotic factors (salinity, [Ca2+], [HCO3-] and pH) impact calcification in mytilid mussels along the Baltic salinity gradient. Laboratory experiments rearing juvenile Baltic Mytilus at a range of salinities (6, 11 and 16), HCO3- concentrations (300–2100 µmol kg-1) and Ca2+ concentrations (0.5–4 mmol kg-1) reveal that as individual factors, low [HCO3-], pH and salinity cannot explain low calcification rates in the Baltic Sea. Calcification rates are impeded when Ωaragonite ≤ 1 or ESIR ≤ 0.7 primarily due to [Ca2+] limitation which becomes relevant at a salinity of ca. 11 in the Baltic Sea. Field monitoring of carbonate chemistry and calcification rates suggest increased food availability may be able to mask the negative impacts of periodic sub-optimal carbonate chemistry, but not when seawater conditions are permanently adverse, as observed in two Baltic reefs at salinities < 11. Regional climate models predict a rapid desalination of the southwest and central Baltic over the next century and potentially a reduction in [Ca2+] which may shift the distribution of marine calcifiers westward. It is therefore vital to understand the mechanisms by which the ionic composition of seawater impacts bivalve calcification for better predicting the future of benthic Baltic ecosystems.

T1  - Expanding Aquaculture Opportunities in the Northeastern United States Through Ecologically-Sound Diversification
AN  - 2512767545
AB  - The goal of this dissertation was to investigate ways to expand bivalve aquaculture opportunities in the northeastern United States through ecologically-sound diversification (ESD). In an aquaculture context, ESD is defined as the practice of cultivating multiple species in a manner that minimizes negative impacts on the surrounding ecosystem while remaining adaptive and resilient to environmental change. Bivalve aquaculture is among the least environmentally damaging forms of food production and many of its impacts serve a net benefit to surrounding ecosystems, making it an ideal starting point for ESD. In the Northeast, production is dominated by the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and the hard clam (Mercenaria mercenaria), and high-efficiency yet risk-prone monoculture is the norm. In the first unit (Chapters 2 and 3), various aspects of Atlantic surfclam (Spisula solidissima) husbandry were evaluated to test whether this species can become an alternative species for shellfish growers. In Chapter 2, the effect of rearing temperature on the survival and growth of early juvenile surfclams was investigated. The results show that of the temperatures tested, 20˚C was optimal for promoting survival and growth. In Chapter 3, a series of controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of various surfclam nursery and grow-out techniques. In the nursery phase, juvenile surfclams were reared in various gear types. In the grow-out phase experiments, surfclam growth, survival, and condition were evaluated at three New Jersey farms. Results show that multiple rearing methods can effectively produce surfclams, but flow rate, food availability, and temperature are important factors that affect gear efficiency. In the grow-out experiments, survival varied across farms and across years; growth and condition were consistent across farms but varied seasonally. The second unit (Chapters 4 and 5) expands upon the results of the previous chapters, which demonstrated the vulnerability of surfclams to heat stress. Research presented in Unit 2 takes a proactive approach towards climate-informed aquaculture. In Chapter 4, the feasibility of breeding surfclams for greater heat tolerance is explored. The results indicated that when juvenile surfclams were exposed to prolonged lethal temperatures, the adult survivors withstood subsequent heat stress for significantly longer than individuals that did not experience heat stress as juveniles. Additionally, selective breeding enhanced heat tolerance in first-generation surfclam progeny. To understand how selection via heat stress could alter the gene expression of a surfclam population, a transcriptomics study was conducted (Chapter 5). The results show that randomly selected (control) clams differentially expressed more genes in response to heat stress than the heat-selected clams, yet the latter group exhibited significantly stronger expression of heat shock proteins and other stress-response genes. In the third and final unit (Chapter 6), the efficacy of bivalve polyculture was evaluated using four cultured species: the Eastern oyster (C. virginica), the Atlantic surfclam (S. solidissima), the hard clam (M. mercenaria), and the softshell clam (Mya arenaria). Three particle depletion experiments were conducted to determine if more diverse bivalve assemblages had greater clearance rates than those which were less diverse. Likewise, the effect of species richness on bivalve productivity (growth and survival) was evaluated. When supplied with natural seston, the four-species polyculture demonstrated a significantly greater tank-level clearance rate for particles <25 µm compared to most monocultures. However, nearly all productivity metrics were unaffected by species richness. Overall, this dissertation finds that the surfclam is a good candidate for species diversification in the Northeast, and the species fits well into the region’s established farming framework. Despite the current and future risks that the warming climate poses for the surfclam, this dissertation also finds that selective breeding may be a viable strategy for enhancing the survival of cultured surfclams. Finally, this dissertation provides some of the first evidence for niche complementarity among four cultured bivalves and demonstrates that in non-food limited systems, the focal species can be co-cultured without outcompeting one another. Taken together, this dissertation concludes that ecologically-sound diversification can be achieved spatially, temporally, and genetically in the northeastern United States.

T1  - First report of detection of microcystins in farmed mediterranean mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis in Thermaikos gulf in Greece
AN  - 2502601072
AB  - Background
Microcystins are emerging marine biotoxins, produced by potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Their presence has been reported in aquatic animals in Greek freshwater, while data are few in marine environments. Since the climate change induces eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in coastal marine ecosystems affecting the public health, further research on microcystins’ presence in marine waters is required. The aim of this study was to examine the potential presence of microcystins in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis in the largest farming areas in Thermaikos gulf, in Northern Greece, and to investigate their temporal and spatial distribution, adding to the knowledge of microcystins presence in Greek Mediterranean mussels.
Results
A 4-year microcystins’ assessment was conducted from 2013 to 2016, in farmed Mediterranean mussels M. galloprovincialis, in five sampling areas in Thermaikos gulf, in northern Greece, where the 90% of the Greek mussels’ farming activities is located. The isolation of potentially toxic cyanobacteria was confirmed by molecular methods. An initial screening was performed with a qualitative and quantitative direct monoclonal (DM) ELISA and results above 1 ng g−1 were confirmed for the occurrence of the most common microcystins-RR, -LR and -YR, by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with a high- resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) (Orbitrap analyzer). Microcystin-RR and microcystin-LR were detected, while the intensity of microcystin-YR was below the method detection limit. Most samples that exhibited concentrations above 1 ng g-1 were detected during the warm seasons of the year and especially in spring. Results indicated an overestimation of the ELISA method, since concentrations ranged between 0.70 ± 0.15 ng g−1 and 53.90 ± 3.18 ng g−1, while the confirmation denoted that the levels of microcystins were 6 to 22 times lower.
Conclusions
Microcystin-RR and microcystin-LR were detected for the first time in mussel M. galloprovincialis, harvested from farms in Thermaikos gulf, in Central Macedonia, Greece. Their presence was linked to potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Bioaccumulation was observed in digestive gland, while the concentrations in muscles were found extremely low. Samples with levels above 1 ng g−1 were observed mostly during spring, confirming the seasonal distribution of microcystins. The comparison of the results by the ELISA and the LC-Orbitrap MS method indicated an overestimation of concentration by the ELISA method.

T1  - Exploring Biophysical Linkages between Coastal Forestry Management Practices and Aquatic Bivalve Contaminant Exposure
AN  - 2497653751
AB  - Terrestrial land use activities present cross-ecosystem threats to riverine and marine species and processes. Specifically, pesticide runoff can disrupt hormonal, reproductive, and developmental processes in aquatic organisms, yet non-point source pollution is difficult to trace and quantify. In Oregon, U.S.A., state and federal forestry pesticide regulations, designed to meet regulatory water quality requirements, differ in buffer size and pesticide applications. We deployed passive water samplers and collected riverine and estuarine bivalves Margaritifera falcata, Mya arenaria, and Crassostrea gigas from Oregon Coast watersheds to examine forestry-specific pesticide contamination. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling and regression to relate concentrations and types of pesticide contamination across watersheds to ownership and management metrics. In bivalve samples collected from eight coastal watersheds, we measured twelve unique pesticides (two herbicides; three fungicides; and seven insecticides). Pesticides were detected in 38% of bivalve samples; and frequency and maximum concentrations varied by season, species, and watershed with indaziflam (herbicide) the only current-use forestry pesticide detected. Using passive water samplers, we measured four current-use herbicides corresponding with planned herbicide applications; hexazinone and atrazine were most frequently detected. Details about types and levels of exposure provide insight into effectiveness of current forest management practices in controlling transport of forest-use pesticides.

T1  - Lake thermal structure drives interannual variability in summer anoxia dynamics in a eutrophic lake over 37 years
AN  - 2492849481
AB  - The concentration of oxygen is fundamental to lake water quality and ecosystem functioning through its control over habitat availability for organisms, redox reactions, and recycling of organic material. In many eutrophic lakes, oxygen depletion in the bottom layer (hypolimnion) occurs annually during summer stratification. The temporal and spatial extent of summer hypolimnetic anoxia is determined by interactions between the lake and its external drivers (e.g., catchment characteristics, nutrient loads, meteorology) as well as internal feedback mechanisms (e.g., organic matter recycling, phytoplankton blooms). How these drivers interact to control the evolution of lake anoxia over decadal timescales will determine, in part, the future lake water quality. In this study, we used a vertical one-dimensional hydrodynamic–ecological model (GLM-AED2) coupled with a calibrated hydrological catchment model (PIHM-Lake) to simulate the thermal and water quality dynamics of the eutrophic Lake Mendota (USA) over a 37 year period. The calibration and validation of the lake model consisted of a global sensitivity evaluation as well as the application of an optimization algorithm to improve the fit between observed and simulated data. We calculated stability indices (Schmidt stability, Birgean work, stored internal heat), identified spring mixing and summer stratification periods, and quantified the energy required for stratification and mixing. To qualify which external and internal factors were most important in driving the interannual variation in summer anoxia, we applied a random-forest classifier and multiple linear regressions to modeled ecosystem variables (e.g., stratification onset and offset, ice duration, gross primary production). Lake Mendota exhibited prolonged hypolimnetic anoxia each summer, lasting between 50–60 d. The summer heat budget, the timing of thermal stratification, and the gross primary production in the epilimnion prior to summer stratification were the most important predictors of the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia periods in Lake Mendota. Interannual variability in anoxia was largely driven by physical factors: earlier onset of thermal stratification in combination with a higher vertical stability strongly affected the duration and spatial extent of summer anoxia. A measured step change upward in summer anoxia in 2010 was unexplained by the GLM-AED2 model. Although the cause remains unknown, possible factors include invasion by the predacious zooplankton Bythotrephes longimanus. As the heat budget depended primarily on external meteorological conditions, the spatial and temporal extent of summer anoxia in Lake Mendota is likely to increase in the near future as a result of projected climate change in the region.

T1  - Diversity and Structure of Pelagic Zooplankton (Crustacea, Rotifera) in NE Poland
AN  - 2489135583
AB  - This study presents the diversity and structure of pelagic zooplankton in north-eastern Poland. The research was conducted in 47 lakes with different trophic conditions in the middle of summer. Samples were collected close to the deepest part of the lakes to avoid the diverse benthic and littoral zones. We found 119 zooplankton species of which 32 were Cladocera, 16 were Cyclopoida, 4 were Calanoida, and 67 were Rotifera. We determined which species occurred most frequently in the region, as well as the species that were characteristic of different trophic conditions. We also recorded the presence of eight cold-adapted species which some of them are considered as glacial relicts (e.g., Eurytemora lacustris, Heterocope appendiculata, Cyclops lacustris). Our research revealed potential glacial refugia for planktonic species in 14 lakes of NE Poland. Our study suggests that the presence of stenotherm species may be an excellent indicator of the ecological status of deep lakes and could be considered in lake monitoring programs. Furthermore, we did not find Bythotrephes longimanus which has been reported from Poland. Instead, we found that B. brevimanus was the most common representative of the genus in the study area.

T1  - Management of the Phosphorus–Cladophora Dynamic at a Site on Lake Ontario Using a Multi-Module Bioavailable P Model
AN  - 2486399528
AB  - The filamentous green alga Cladophora grows to nuisance proportions in Lake Ontario. Stimulated by high phosphorus concentrations, nuisance growth results in the degradation of beaches and clogging of industrial water intakes with attendant loss of beneficial uses. We develop a multi-module bioavailable phosphorus model to examine the efficacy of phosphorus management strategies in mitigating nuisance algal growth. The model platform includes modules simulating hydrodynamics (FVCOM), phosphorus-phytoplankton dynamics (GEM) and Cladophora growth (GLCMv3). The model is applied along a 25 km stretch of the Lake Ontario nearshore, extending east from Toronto, ON and receiving effluent from three wastewater treatment plants. Simulation results identify the Duffin Creek wastewater treatment plant effluent as a driving force for nuisance conditions of Cladophora growth, as reflected in effluent bioavailable phosphorus concentrations and the dimensions of the plant’s phosphorus footprint. Simulation results demonstrate that phosphorus removal by chemically enhanced secondary treatment is insufficient to provide relief from nuisance conditions. Tertiary treatment (chemically enhanced secondary treatment with ballasted flocculation) is shown to eliminate phosphorus-saturated conditions associated with the Duffin Creek wastewater treatment plant effluent, providing local relief from nuisance conditions. Management guidance presented here has wider application at sites along the highly urbanized Canadian nearshore of Lake Ontario.

T1  - Freshwater mussels (Unionidae) brought into captivity exhibit up-regulation of genes involved in stress and energy metabolism
AN  - 2480893589
AB  - Approximately two thirds of freshwater mussel species in the United States and Canada are imperiled, and populations are declining rapidly. Translocation and captive management are commonly used to mitigate losses of freshwater mussel biodiversity, but these conservation tools may result in decreased growth and increased mortality. This study uses RNA-Seq to determine how translocation into captivity affects gene expression in Amblema plicata. Mussels were collected from the Muskingum River in Ohio, USA and brought into a captive holding facility. RNA was extracted from gill tissue 11 months post translocation from mussels in captivity and the Muskingum River on the same day. RNA was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500, and differential expression analysis was performed on de novo assembled transcripts. More than 1200 transcripts were up-regulated in captive mussels, and 246 were assigned functional annotations. Many up-regulated transcripts were involved in energy metabolism and the stress response, such as heat shock proteins and antioxidants. More than 500 transcripts were down-regulated in captive mussels, and 41 were assigned functional annotations. We observed an over-representation of down-regulated transcripts associated with immune response. Our work suggests that A. plicata experienced moderate levels of stress and altered energy metabolism and immune response for at least 11 months post translocation into captivity.

T1  - Metabarcoding assays for the detection of freshwater mussels (Unionida) with environmental DNA
AN  - 2478782033
AB  - Freshwater mussels of the order Unionida are a widely distributed taxon that are important in maintaining freshwater ecosystems and are also highly imperiled throughout the world. Monitoring of mussel populations with environmental DNA (eDNA) is an attractive alternative to traditional methods because it is noninvasive and requires less labor and taxonomic knowledge from field personnel. We developed eDNA metabarcoding assays specific to freshwater mussels and tested them at six sites in the Clinch River, located in the southeastern United States. Our objective was to determine the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for future monitoring of mussel populations and restoration efforts in this watershed. Two metabarcoding assays that target the mitochondrial DNA regions of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit (ND1) genes were developed and tested. Our assays appear to be order specific, amplifying members from the two families found in North America, Unionidae and Margaritiferidae, while not amplifying nontarget fish or other bivalve species. From the field collected samples, our assays together detected 19 species, eight of which are listed as federally endangered. The assays also detected 42%, 58%, and 54% of the species identified by recent quantitative visual mussel surveys at three sampling sites. Increased sampling effort by processing a greater water volume or number of samples will likely increase species detections. These eDNA metabarcoding assays may enable enhanced monitoring of freshwater mussel assemblages and subsequently inform conservation efforts.

T1  - Effects of Diclofenac on the embryonic development of freshwater crayfish
AN  - 2623485258
AB  - In recent years, there has been increasing concern about the ecotoxicological consequences of the drug Diclofenac on freshwater organisms. Influences on the largest freshwater invertebrates, the freshwater crayfish, are especially interesting in the context of cascading effects due to their important role as keystone species. In this study, lethality, influences on body weight, embryonic development and histological changes in embryos of marbled crayfish (Procambarus virginalis) as well as noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) were investigated in response to their exposure to different concentrations of Diclofenac. Additionally, the suitability of marbled crayfish as a model organism for endemic freshwater crayfish was established when studying the effects of Diclofenac. For both species, lethal effects started at concentrations of 10.24 mg/L Diclofenac, weight was not affected, embryonic development slowed down from concentrations of 0.16 mg/L and histological changes were visible from concentrations of 0.64 mg/L. The similarity of LOEC (Lowest Observed Effect Concentrations) between the two species showed that marbled crayfish can serve as a model for native crayfish when investigating the effects of exposure to Diclofenac.

T1  - Modelling the effects of Spartina alterniflora invasion on the landscape succession of Yancheng coastal natural wetlands, China
AN  - 2463802257
AB  - Background 
The Yancheng coastal natural wetlands (YCNR) are well-preserved silty tidal flat wetlands in China. Due to the severe invasion of Spartina alterniflora, the native ecosystem has undergone great changes. The successful invasion of S. alterniflora reduced the biodiversity of the YCNR, changed the structure and function of the local ecosystem, and eventually led to the degradation of the ecosystem and the loss of ecosystem function and service. Fully understanding the impact of an alien species invasion on YCNR succession is an important prerequisite for protecting and restoring the wetlands.
 Methods 
In this study, remote sensing, GIS technology, and a cellular-automaton Markov model were used to simulate the natural succession process of native ecosystems without being affected by alien species. By comparing the landscape of the YCNR with the model simulation results, we gained a better understanding of how alien species affect native landscape-scale ecosystems.
 Results 
During the natural succession of the coastal native wetland ecosystem in the YCNR, the pioneer species S. alterniflora occupied the mudflats and expanded seaward. The whole area expanded and moved seaward with an average annual movement of 58.23 m. Phragmites australis seemed to dominate the competition with S. salsa communities, and the area gradually expanded with an average annual movement of 39.89 m. The invasion of S. alterniflora changed the native ecosystem’s spatial succession process, causing the S. salsa ecosystem to be stressed by ecosystems on the side of the sea (S. alterniflora) and that of land (P. australis). The area of the seaward-expanding P. australis ecosystem has been declining. Under a reasonable protected area policy, human activities have enhanced the succession rate of the P. australis ecosystem and have had a small impact on the ecological spatial succession of S. salsa and S. alterniflora.

T1  - Megafauna in Salt Marshes
AN  - 2460181735
AB  - Megafauna shape ecosystems globally through trophic interactions, ecology of fear, and ecosystem engineering. Highly productive salt marshes at the interface of terrestrial and marine systems have the potential to support megafauna species, but a recent global meta-analysis of consumer-plant interactions in marshes found few studies investigated impacts of wild megafauna. We conducted a literature review to document the variety of megafauna in salt marshes and found that 34 species utilize salt marshes, including sharks, manatees, pinnipeds, crocodilians, sea otters, hippos, and large terrestrial animals, such as lions, bears and water buffalo. The use of salt marsh habitats by a variety of megafauna may have implications for both the conservation of these large consumers and for the resilience of coastal wetlands through stabilizing feedbacks on plant ecosystems. Future studies should quantify the occurrence and impacts of megafauna in salt marshes, and how their conservation can help restore these valuable ecosystems.

T1  - Demographic and genetic characterization of harvested Corbicula fluminea populations
AN  - 2440209387
AB  - The freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea s.l. is an edible freshwater bivalve of economic value in Asia. The species has been particularly well studied in the invaded range. However, there is a lack of knowledge in its native range where it supports an increasing commercial harvest pressure. Among Asiatic countries, China accounts for 70% of known commercial harvest and aquaculture production. We aim to characterize here wild C. fluminea s.l populations exposed to commercial harvest pressure in Poyang Lake Basin. We found higher biomass, density and genetic diversity in lake populations compared to peripheral populations (i.e., lake tributaries). Given that lake habitats support more intense harvest pressure than peripheral habitats, we suggest that demographic and genetic differentiation among subpopulations may be influenced in some degree by different harvest pressure. In this regard, additional demographic and/or genetic changes related to increasing harvest pressure may place population at a higher risk of extirpation. Altogether, these results are especially relevant for maintaining populations at or above viable levels and must be considered in order to ensure the sustainability of the resource.

T1  - A low number of introduced marine species at low latitudes: a case study from southern Florida with a special focus on Mollusca
AN  - 2439527717
AB  - The anthropogenic transfer of non-indigenous marine species (NIMS) into new areas of the oceans is a key issue. Despite increasing research effort in recent years many fundamental questions remain to be answered before we can effectively manage the issue. One question is whether the greater number of NIMS thus far documented in temperate waters is real or an artefact of fewer surveys being undertaken in tropical environments. Another one is whether poor taxonomic knowledge of the biodiverse tropics hides NIMS that actually occur there. Extensive taxonomic work in three Pacific localities (Guam, northern Western Australia and Singapore) has been collated in previous papers showing that there are relatively few NIMS in these biodiverse environments. The present paper replicates investigations for a low latitude environment in southern Florida in the Atlantic Ocean. The focus area includes the extensive Florida Keys coral reef environment, the southern margin of the Everglades on Florida Bay and the major PortMiami. Only 48 NIMS were identified in a literature-based compilation of 4,615 species; 15 species were represented by isolated records and have not established populations, leaving only 33 NIMS that are established or whose status is unknown. Records for Mollusca, the group with the most species (1,153) in the compilation, were individually researched and taxonomically verified. It is argued that the relative paucity of NIMS is not a straightforward temperature-driven tropical/temperate issue, but instead there are biological factor(s) restricting the ability of NIMS to colonise biodiverse environments compared to less diverse areas.

T1  - A century of injurious wildlife listing under the Lacey Act: a history
AN  - 2439527532
AB  - In its 120-year history, the major injurious wildlife provision of the Lacey Act has remained nearly intact. The purpose of the Federal law has always been to protect the United States from the introduction of invasive and otherwise harmful species. Amendments along the way have transformed the law, sometimes narrowing and sometimes broadening. Here for the first time, the major changes to the injurious wildlife law from 1900 to the current law are compiled to provide a history that is critical to understanding how the nation’s oldest invasive species law has varied in its ability to prevent wildlife invasions. In 1900, under the oversight of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the newly enacted law prohibited the importation of any foreign wild mammal or bird to protect agriculture and horticulture, with exceptions only by permit. A small designated subset of wild mammals and birds could not be imported under any circumstance, and these were the first injurious species. For almost a half century, little changed. The 1939 amendment transferred authority of injurious wildlife to the U.S. Department of the Interior, a change affecting little except the oversight. Then a 1948 amendment removed a critical clause. The deletion suddenly removed the prohibition on the importation of any wild mammal or bird, except for the designated injurious species, which were still unconditionally prohibited. In 1960, Congress expanded the injurious provisions of the Lacey Act (18 U.S.C. 42) by authorizing additional vertebrate and some invertebrate taxa that may be designated as injurious and by authorizing additional categories of interests that could be affected. Simultaneously, however, the unconditional prohibition for injurious species was replaced with a permit exception system, and the 1960 amendments have remained to this day. By presenting how the law varied over the decades, this history will allow scientists to determine the effectiveness of a law that is well into its second century.

T1  - A pathways risk assessment of aquatic non-indigenous macroinvertebrates passing to, and through, the Central European invasion corridor
AN  - 2439527213
AB  - A pathways risk assessment is a part of an integrated assessment for the horizon scanning of non-indigenous species introductions. We examined past pathways, and their vectors, of aquatic NIS already present in Belarus in order to predict those species likely to spread to Belarus and arrive to Western Europe along the Central European invasion corridor. Twenty-four aquatic non-indigenous macroinvertebrates are known within Belarusian rivers, lakes and reservoirs, six of these have already spread westwards through Belarus. The modes of spread for these NIS were vessel transport, navigation corridors, and natural spread following an initial introduction.

T1  - Shelter use interactions of invasive lionfish with commercially and ecologically important native invertebrates on Caribbean coral reefs
AN  - 2437389699
AB  - Indo-Pacific lionfish have become invasive throughout the western Atlantic. Their predatory effects have been the focus of much research and are suggested to cause declines in native fish abundance and diversity across the invaded range. However, little is known about their non-consumptive effects, or their effects on invertebrates. Lionfish use shelters on the reef, thus there is potential for competition with other shelter-dwelling organisms. We demonstrate similar habitat associations between invasive lionfish, native spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) and native long-spined sea urchins (Diadema antillarum), indicating the potential for competition. We then used a laboratory experiment to compare activity and shelter use of each species when alone and when lionfish were paired with each native species. Spiny lobsters increased their activity but did not change their shelter use in the presence of a lionfish, whilst long-spined sea urchins changed neither their activity nor shelter use. However, lionfish reduced their shelter use in the presence of spiny lobsters and long-spined sea urchins. This study highlights the importance not only of testing for the non-consumptive effects of invasive species, but also exploring whether native species exert non-consumptive effects on the invasive.

T1  - Hitchhikers on floats to Arctic freshwater: Private aviation and recreation loss from aquatic invasion
AN  - 2405360031
AB  - This study of aviation-related recreation loss shows that a survey primarily aimed at collecting information on invasive species’ pathways can also be used to estimate changes in pathway-related ecosystem services. We present a case study for Elodea spp. (elodea), Alaska’s first known aquatic invasive plant, by combining respondents’ stated pre-invasion actual flights with stated post-invasion contingent behavior, plane operating costs, and site quality data. We asked pilots about the extent of continued flights should destinations become invaded and inhibit flight safety. We estimate a recreation demand model where the lost trip value to the average floatplane pilot whose destination is an elodea-invaded lake is US$185 (95 % CI $157, $211). Estimates of ecosystem damages incurred by private actors responsible for transmitting invaders can nudge actors to change behavior and inform adaptive ecosystem management. The policy and modeling implications of quantifying such damages and integration into more complex models are discussed.

T1  - Eutrophication and restoration in temperate lakes
AN  - 2556090222
AB  - Eutrophication affects many lakes and reservoirs worldwide. It is caused by excessive amounts of nutrients entering waterbodies from their catchments, mainly due to human activity. The main sources of these nutrients are discharges from industry and wastewater treatment systems, and agricultural runoff. The water quality problems caused by eutrophication, such as harmful algal blooms, affect the sustainable use of lakes for agriculture, fisheries, recreation, tourism and water supply. They also degrade habitat quality and threaten biodiversity. A range of methods for improving lake water quality are explored, including catchment management and in-lake restoration measures. The potential impacts of these on lake biodiversity are explored, including species interactions and ecosystem feedbacks that may confound the recovery process. A particular challenge is the fact that achieving sustainable recovery may take many years, mainly due to the impact of legacy pollution problems. This must be taken into account when planning and implementing eutrophication management options, because these slow recovery periods can exceed the timescales that people are willing to accept. While this review focuses on the many well documented studies of restoration and recovery processes in temperate lakes, it also highlights the need for similar research on tropical and sub-tropical systems.

T1  - 60 specific eDNA qPCR assays to detect invasive, threatened, and exploited freshwater vertebrates and invertebrates in Eastern Canada
AN  - 2462514072
AB  - Practical applications of environmental DNA (eDNA) are in exponential expansion, especially for the assessment and monitoring of freshwater metazoans. Because eDNA sampling and analysis is noninvasive, it improves the detection of threatened, invasive, and exploited species for which monitoring may be challenging. Species detection efforts using a combination of eDNA and qPCR have been highly successful and, as a result, their use in species monitoring is expanding rapidly. We developed qPCR primers and probes in order to monitor many invasive, threatened, or exploited aquatic species as part of various monitoring eDNA projects in the province of Québec, Canada. Here, we present a total of 60 species‐specific qPCR assays (including PCR protocols, primers, and TaqMan probes sequences) developed for the detection of 45 fishes, six amphibians, five reptiles, two mollusks, and two crustaceans. These comprised nine and 27 species, respectively, listed as invasive and threatened in Eastern Canada. These resources should be of broad usefulness not only for monitoring studies based in Québec but throughout the geographic range of the targeted species in North America.

T1  - Regulating Vessel Biofouling to Support New Zealand’s Marine Biosecurity System – A Blue Print for Evidence-Based Decision Making
AN  - 2414907989
AB  - A healthy marine environment is integral to many of New Zealand’s economic, social and cultural values, which include fisheries, aquaculture, tourism, and recreational and customary activities. The introduction and spread of marine non-indigenous species (NIS) via the vessel biofouling pathway may put these values at risk. Over the past two decades, the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) has been proactive in commissioning research focused on the risks associated with vessel biofouling, identification of potential risk vessels, and risk management options. In 2010, MPI consulted on options to manage the biofouling risks on all vessels entering New Zealand waters. In 2014, New Zealand became the first country to introduce mandatory biofouling requirements. Between 2014 and 2018, MPI focused on communicating the requirements to support stakeholder awareness, readiness and uptake. In parallel, MPI commissioned further research to investigate proactive and reactive approaches to biofouling management. Research outcomes were summarized and technical advice provided to inform stakeholders of what constitutes best biofouling management practices. This review summarizes MPI’s research and technical advice on the risks associated with vessel biofouling and its management, and the procedures followed to produce New Zealand’s biofouling regulations. The development of these regulations is also contextualized in terms of New Zealand’s marine biosecurity system. The transparent and evidence-based approach followed by MPI provides a blueprint for establishing biofouling regulations. Because these regulations are based on International Maritime Organization guidelines, there is the potential to develop consistent global and domestic practices for managing marine NIS introduction and spread.

Numerous taxa are at risk from microplastics including commercially valuable bivalves as seafood, which are also disproportionately important as biogenic reef-forming species that enhance biodiversity such that they are commonly protected under conservation actions. As a sessile filter-feeding organism, bivalves are highly susceptible to microplastic ingestion but despite their socio-economic and ecological importance, no research has been undertaken to assess how a reef’s structural arrangement might affect plastic ingestion. Here, using a series of flume experiments, we examined how change in spatial arrangement of the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, interacts with different flow speeds to effect retention of microplastic over reef surfaces and ingestion risk by individual mussels. Our results show that clumped spatial arrangements reduce boundary layer velocities, and increase turbulence, boundary layer thickness and plastic retention over reef surfaces under faster flow conditions, increasing plastic ingestion by 3-fold. Our findings suggest that the structural arrangement and rugosity of natural reef structures may create natural sinks of anthropogenic pollution, and species like Mytilus that are also important species for human consumption, while disproportionately susceptible to microplastic pollution, may be useful bioindicators of microplastic pollution.

T1  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) detection of marine aquatic invasive species (AIS) in Eastern Canada using a targeted species-specific qPCR approach
AN  - 2408714489
AB  - Aquatic invasive species (AIS) represent a significant threat to aquatic ecosystems, and early detection is a crucial step in mitigating risks of establishment and spread. In this study, we designed and/or optimized species-specific qPCR assays for 9 marine invertebrates considered invasive in Eastern Canada for use in conjunction with environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling. All qPCR assays showed high analytical sensitivity with theoretical limit of detection (LOD) ranging from 0.045 to 9.24 picogram (pg) of DNA. Comparison of two eDNA water sampling methods showed an increased detection sensitivity using the grab sample approach. eDNA AIS detections were also compared to results obtained using a traditional in situ biofouling monitoring method (i.e., biofouling monitoring lines), and a high concordance between the two was observed. We also determined temporal variability in the amount of DNA found in the environment for some of the targeted AIS, which will help target seasonal monitoring efforts. The results provided herein clearly demonstrate the usefulness of including eDNA for early AIS detection in ongoing monitoring, rapid response investigations and mitigation/eradication efforts.

T1  - Democratizing water monitoring: Implementation of a community-based qPCR monitoring program for recreational water hazards
AN  - 2402401122
AB  - Recreational water monitoring can be challenging due to the highly variable nature of pathogens and indicator concentrations, the myriad of potential biological hazards to measure for, and numerous access points, both official and unofficial, that are used for recreation. The aim of this study was to develop, deploy, and assess the effectiveness of a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) community-based monitoring (CBM) program for the assessment of bacterial and parasitic hazards in recreational water. This study developed methodologies for performing qPCR ‘in the field,’ then engaged with water management and monitoring groups and tested the method in a real-world implementation study to evaluate the accuracy of CBM using qPCR both quantitatively and qualitatively. This study found high reproducibility between qPCR results performed by non-expert field users and expert laboratory results, suggesting that qPCR as a methodology could be amenable to a CBM program.

T1  - Experimental evidence that the invasive snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843) survives passage through the digestive tract of common riverine fish
AN  - 2369706379
AB  - Potamopyrgus antipodarum is one of the most widespread invasive species worldwide and its expansion is ongoing. Although the snail has already been documented as surviving the digestive tract of various fish, there is insufficient data on potential riverine fish predators of P. antipodarum and of the ability of the snail to survive digestion by these fish. Lotic ecosystems are unfavourable for the upstream spread of this species by active movement and thus it is suspected that benthivorous riverine fish facilitate such upstream dispersion. In general, the results of this study indicated that P. antipodarum is not a preferable food object for the studied riverine fish. The study did indicate, however, that the invasive snail is capable of surviving the digestive tract of all the studied fish. As accidental consumption of abundant P. antipodarum with other food objects has already been documented, this study suggests that riverine fish can act as potential secondary dispersion vectors, facilitating the upstream dispersion of the snail.

T1  - Population-level inferences from environmental DNA—Current status and future perspectives
AN  - 2343400928
AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from water samples has recently shown potential as a valuable source of population genetic information for aquatic macroorganisms. This approach offers several potential advantages compared with conventional tissue-based methods, including the fact that eDNA sampling is noninvasive and generally more cost-efficient. Currently, eDNA approaches have been limited to single-marker studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and the relationship between eDNA haplotype composition and true haplotype composition still needs to be thoroughly verified. This will require testing of bioinformatic and statistical software to correct for erroneous sequences, as well as biases and random variation in relative sequence abundances. However, eDNA-based population genetic methods have far-reaching potential for both basic and applied research. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the achievements of eDNA-based population genetics to date, and outline the prospects for future developments in the field, including the estimation of nuclear DNA (nuDNA) variation and epigenetic information. We discuss the challenges associated with eDNA samples as opposed to those of individual tissue samples and assess whether eDNA might offer additional types of information unobtainable with tissue samples. Lastly, we provide recommendations for determining whether an eDNA approach would be a useful and suitable choice in different research settings. We limit our discussion largely to contemporary aquatic systems, but the advantages, challenges, and perspectives can to a large degree be generalized to eDNA studies with a different spatial and temporal focus.

T1  - Desiccation tolerance of the invasive alga starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa) as an indicator of overland spread risk
AN  - 3037393048
AB  - Human-assisted transport via recreational boats and trailers is thought to account for most contemporary movement of aquatic invasive species (AIS) among lakes. The ability of invasive macrophytes to survive out of water, that is, their desiccation tolerance, is an important indicator of capacity for spread to new water bodies through overland transport. Invasion by the alga starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa [Desv. in LoiseL] J. Groves; Characeae) in North America is likely driven via overland transport, but little is known regarding its ability to remain viable out of water. We conducted laboratory and outdoor experiments to evaluate desiccation tolerance of starry stonewort propagules, including single stem fragments, small and large clumps of fragments, and bulbils (asexual reproductive structures). Propagules were removed from water for 15 min to 5 d to identify desiccation thresholds. Fully desiccated fragments and clumps lost ^90% of their original mass and bulbils >60% of original mass. Based on the most conservative estimates from our experiments, starry stonewort was no longer viable at 2 h for single fragments, 24 h for small (5-g) clumps, 4 d for large (45-g) clumps, and 4 h for bulbils. Overall, starry stonewort appears less tolerant of desiccation than other invasive macrophytes that have been evaluated, which comprise vascular plants rather than Characean algae. Widely adopted guidance that boats should dry on land for 5 d to prevent AIS spread should suffice to prevent most starry stonewort spread between water bodies, given that boaters comply with inspection protocols and remove large, readily detected clumps.

T1  - The Application of Artificial Mussels in Conjunction with Transplanted Bivalves to Assess Elemental Exposure in a Platinum Mining Area
AN  - 2550500642
AB  - There is increasing evidence that platinum group elements (PGE) are pollutants of emerging concern worldwide. Limited information exists on levels, particularly in regions where PGEs are mined. A passive sampling device (i.e., the artificial mussel (AM)) and transplanted indicator organisms (i.e., the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminalis africana) were deployed along a PGE mining gradient in the Hex River, South Africa, and concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, Pb, Pt, V, and Zn were determined after six weeks of exposure. Results showed differential uptake patterns for Pt, Cr, and Ni between the AMs and clams indicating availability differences. For monitoring purposes, a combination of AMs and indicator organisms provides a more holistic assessment of element exposure in aquatic environments.

T1  - The Impact of Tourism Activity on Coastal Biodiversity: A Case Study at Praia da Cova Redonda (Algarve—Portugal)
AN  - 2548371415
AB  - Tourism activity has a very significant weight in the world economy, even being the main activity responsible for the export of many countries, in the form of providing services to foreign citizens. In mainland Portugal, the main tourist region is the Algarve, where beach tourism, known as sun and sea tourism, plays a decisive role. However, this activity also has its negative impacts. In the present work, a case study was analyzed, at Praia da Cova Redonda, located in the parish of Porches, in the municipality of Lagoa. Negative impacts on land use and occupation were identified, caused by the excessive presence of people, the introduction of invasive species and the artificial filling of beaches. At the end, a set of mitigating measures are presented that aim to ensure that the exploitation of natural resources can be maintained, but in a perspective of preservation and recovery of natural resources and biodiversity.

T1  - Phenotypic plasticity at fine-grained spatial scales: the scorched mussel Perumytilus purpuratus growing on Patagonian rocky salt-marshes
AN  - 2536845309
AB  - Understanding phenotypic plasticity of species at different spatial scales is vital in the current context of an increasing pace of environmental changes. Through this knowledge, it is possible to predict their potential to adapt and/or evolve in face of new environmental conditions such as climate change, and/or to understand their ecological range expansion. In Patagonian rocky salt-marshes, one of the most abundant invertebrate species is the scorched mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. In this system, this mussel can be found inhabiting both vegetated and non-vegetated patches, which differ in critical environmental conditions. We performed a field study evaluating whether mussels growing in vegetated patches differ in shell shape from those growing in adjacent non-vegetated patches. We sampled individuals from both patch types and assessed their shell shape and size using geometric morphometrics. The results showed that mussels from vegetated patches had shells that were more dorsoventrally expanded, anterodorsally restricted and globose in shape than those from non-vegetated patches, which showed the opposite traits resulting in a more elongated shell. The differences found could be driven by the different conditions of temperature, desiccation rate, wave action and population density to which mussels are exposed in each patch type. These results revealed the striking phenotypic plasticity of shell form of this native species at a fine-grained scale, which could be one of the explanations for its success in its ecological range expansion.Alternate abstract: 
Poder comprender la plasticidad fenotípica de las especies, a diferentes escalas espaciales, es fundamental en un contexto de crecientes cambios ambientales. A través de este conocimiento, es posible predecir su potencial para adaptarse y/o evolucionar frente a nuevas condiciones ambientales tales como el cambio climático, y/o entender el modo en el que se expanden o expandieron sus rangos ecológicos. En las marismas rocosas patagónicas, una de las especies de invertebrados marinos más abundantes es el mejillín Perumytilus purpuratus. En este sistema, se lo encuentra en parches vegetados y sin vegetación que difieren en condiciones ambientales críticas. Mediante un estudio a campo, evaluamos si los mejillines que crecen en parches vegetados difieren en la forma de la concha de aquéllos que crecen en parches adyacentes sin vegetación. Para ello, se colectaron individuos de ambos tipos de parches y se evaluó la forma y el tamaño de las valvas utilizando morfometría geométrica. Los resultados mostraron que los mejillines de parches con vegetación presentan conchas más expandidas dorsoventralmente, con restricción anterodorsal, generando una forma globosa en comparación con la de los individuos de parches sin vegetación. Las distintas formas encontradas podrían deberse a las diferentes condiciones de temperatura, desecación, acción de las olas y densidad poblacional a las que están expuestos los mejillines en cada tipo de parche. Estos resultados muestran la presencia de plasticidad fenotípica en la forma de las valvas de esta especie nativa a una microescala espacial, lo que explicaría el éxito de esta especie en su expansión hacia nuevos ambientes.

T1  - Spatial heterogeneities of human-mediated dispersal vectors accelerate the range expansion of invaders with source–destination-mediated dispersal
AN  - 2473302698
AB  - Rapid range expansions of invasive species are a major threat to ecosystems. Understanding how invasive species increase their habitat ranges and how environmental factors, including intensity of human activities, influence dispersal processes is an important issue in invasion biology, especially for invasive species management. We have investigated how spatially heterogeneous factors influence range expansion of an invasive species by focusing on long-distance dispersal, which is frequently assisted by human activities. We have developed models varying two underlying processes of a dispersal event. These events are described by source and destination functions that determine spatial variations in dispersal frequency and the probability of being a dispersal destination. Using these models, we investigated how spatially heterogeneous long-distance dispersal influences range expansion. We found that: (1) spatial variations in the destination function slow down late population dynamics, (2) spatial variations in the source function increase the stochasticity of early population dynamics, and (3) the speed of early population dynamics changes when both the source and the destination functions are spatially heterogeneous and positively correlated. These results suggest an importance of spatial heterogeneity factors in controlling long-distance dispersal when predicting the future spread of invasive species.

T1  - Effectiveness of the European Natura 2000 network to sustain a specialist wintering waterbird population in the face of climate change
AN  - 2473212523
AB  - Analysis of coordinated Greater Scaup (Aythya marila) count data from the last 30 years showed a 38.1% decrease in wintering numbers in North-West Europe, from 309,000 during 1988–1991 to c.192,300 individuals during 2015–2018. Annual trends in wintering numbers differed throughout the range. Numbers decreased in the UK, Ireland, and in the Netherlands, while numbers were stable in Denmark. Germany, Poland, Sweden, and Estonia showed increasing numbers, suggesting a shift in the distribution of the species within its wintering grounds towards the east and north. Higher temperatures in northern and eastern areas were correlated with the range shift of the wintering distribution. Deaths from bycatch drowning of Scaup in fishing gear have significantly decreased in recent decades in the Netherlands, where currently the greatest threat is considered the deterioration of food resources. The increasing concentration of wintering Scaup in coastal Poland and Germany (where lack of effective implementation of conservation measures fail to protect the species from the impacts of bycatch and declining food quality) pose major threats to the entire population.

T1  - Unprepared to Deal with Invasion: Pre-Service Teachers’ Perception, Knowledge and Attitudes toward Invasive Species
AN  - 2471362655
AB  - The serious and growing impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on the planet make it necessary to include this issue with greater determination in educational programs, with the aim of generating citizens capable of dealing with this environmental problem in a sustainable way. Likewise, the management of IAS represents a clear socio-scientific issue (SSI), which gives greater interest to its inclusion in school. At this point, future teachers play a key role, so that their knowledge, perceptions and attitudes on the subject must be evaluated. In order to deal with this objective, a questionnaire was filled out by 400 students of the degrees in early childhood education and primary education of the Universities of La Rioja (UR) and the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain. Our results show that pre-service teachers do not perceive impacts of different types generated by IAS, and they show a clear lack of knowledge about transmission vectors. Likewise, they do not support various control measures, especially slaughter of invasive vertebrates, related to affective dimensions. These results highlight the need to work toward an appropriate integration of this issue at different educational levels, training students and educators, fostering favorable attitudes toward a sustainable management of IAS.

T1  - Diversity of Alien Macroinvertebrate Species in Serbian Waters
AN  - 2471234962
AB  - This article provides the first comprehensive list of alien macroinvertebrate species registered and/or established in aquatic ecosystems in Serbia as a potential threat to native biodiversity. The list comprised field investigations, articles, grey literature, and unpublished data. Twenty-nine species of macroinvertebrates have been recorded since 1942, with a domination of the Ponto-Caspian faunistic elements. The majority of recorded species have broad distribution and are naturalized in the waters of Serbia, while occasional or single findings of seven taxa indicate that these species have failed to form populations. Presented results clearly show that the Danube is the main corridor for the introduction and spread of non-native species into Serbia.

T1  - Carbon Fixation Trends in Eleven of the World’s Largest Lakes: 2003–2018
AN  - 2470563676
AB  - Large freshwater lakes provide immense value to the surrounding populations, yet there is limited understanding of how these lakes will respond to climate change and other factors. This study uses satellite remote sensing to estimate annual, lake-wide primary production in 11 of the world’s largest lakes from 2003–2018. These lakes include the five Laurentian Great Lakes, the three African Great Lakes, Lake Baikal, and Great Bear and Great Slave Lakes. Mean annual production in these lakes ranged from under 200 mgC/m2/day to over 1100 mgC/m2/day, and the lakes were placed into one of three distinct groups (oligotrophic, mesotrophic, or eutrophic) based on their level of production. The analysis revealed only three lakes with significant production trends over the study period, with increases in Great Bear Lake (24% increase over the study period) and Great Slave Lake (27%) and a decline in Lake Tanganyika (−16%). These changes appear to be related to climate change, including increasing temperatures and solar radiation and decreasing wind speeds. This study is the first to use consistent methodology to study primary production in the world’s largest lakes, allowing for these novel between-lake comparisons and assessment of inter-annual trends.

T1  - Extracellular Vesicles and Post-Translational Protein Deimination Signatures in Mollusca—The Blue Mussel (Mytilus edulis), Soft Shell Clam (Mya arenaria), Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and Atlantic Jacknife Clam (Ensis leei)
AN  - 2465485164
AB  - Oysters and clams are important for food security and of commercial value worldwide. They are affected by anthropogenic changes and opportunistic pathogens and can be indicators of changes in ocean environments. Therefore, studies into biomarker discovery are of considerable value. This study aimed at assessing extracellular vesicle (EV) signatures and post-translational protein deimination profiles of hemolymph from four commercially valuable Mollusca species, the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), soft shell clam (Mya arenaria), Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and Atlantic jacknife clam (Ensis leei). EVs form part of cellular communication by transporting protein and genetic cargo and play roles in immunity and host–pathogen interactions. Protein deimination is a post-translational modification caused by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), and can facilitate protein moonlighting in health and disease. The current study identified hemolymph-EV profiles in the four Mollusca species, revealing some species differences. Deiminated protein candidates differed in hemolymph between the species, with some common targets between all four species (e.g., histone H3 and H4, actin, and GAPDH), while other hits were species-specific; in blue mussel these included heavy metal binding protein, heat shock proteins 60 and 90, 2-phospho-D-glycerate hydrolyase, GTP cyclohydrolase feedback regulatory protein, sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase, and fibrinogen domain containing protein. In soft shell clam specific deimination hits included dynein, MCM3-associated protein, and SCRN. In Eastern oyster specific deimination hits included muscle LIM protein, beta-1,3-glucan-binding protein, myosin heavy chain, thaumatin-like protein, vWFA domain-containing protein, BTB domain-containing protein, amylase, and beta-catenin. Deiminated proteins specific to Atlantic jackknife clam included nacre c1q domain-containing protein and PDZ domain-containing protein In addition, some proteins were common as deiminated targets between two or three of the Bivalvia species under study (e.g., EP protein, C1q domain containing protein, histone H2B, tubulin, elongation factor 1-alpha, dominin, extracellular superoxide dismutase). Protein interaction network analysis for the deiminated protein hits revealed major pathways relevant for immunity and metabolism, providing novel insights into post-translational regulation via deimination. The study contributes to EV characterization in diverse taxa and understanding of roles for PAD-mediated regulation of immune and metabolic pathways throughout phylogeny.

T1  - Massive gene presence-absence variation shapes an open pan-genome in the Mediterranean mussel
AN  - 2462184872
AB  - Background 
The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is an ecologically and economically relevant edible marine bivalve, highly invasive and resilient to biotic and abiotic stressors causing recurrent massive mortalities in other bivalves. Although these traits have been recently linked with the maintenance of a high genetic variation within natural populations, the factors underlying the evolutionary success of this species remain unclear.
 Results 
Here, after the assembly of a 1.28-Gb reference genome and the resequencing of 14 individuals from two independent populations, we reveal a complex pan-genomic architecture in M. galloprovincialis, with a core set of 45,000 genes plus a strikingly high number of dispensable genes (20,000) subject to presence-absence variation, which may be entirely missing in several individuals. We show that dispensable genes are associated with hemizygous genomic regions affected by structural variants, which overall account for nearly 580 Mb of DNA sequence not included in the reference genome assembly. As such, this is the first study to report the widespread occurrence of gene presence-absence variation at a whole-genome scale in the animal kingdom.
 Conclusions 
Dispensable genes usually belong to young and recently expanded gene families enriched in survival functions, which might be the key to explain the resilience and invasiveness of this species. This unique pan-genome architecture is characterized by dispensable genes in accessory genomic regions that exceed by orders of magnitude those observed in other metazoans, including humans, and closely mirror the open pan-genomes found in prokaryotes and in a few non-metazoan eukaryotes.

T1  - Using Freshwater Bivalves (Corbicula Fluminea) to Alleviate Harmful Effects of Small-Sized Crucian Carp (Carassius Carassius) on Growth of Submerged Macrophytes during Lake Restoration by Biomanipulation
AN  - 2460953995
AB  - Increased recruitment of small-sized fish following biomanipulation by reducing the biomass of plankti-benthivorous fish, not least in (sub)tropical lakes, may deteriorate water quality and thereby potentially hamper the recovery of submerged macrophytes. Filter-feeding bivalves remove suspended particles from the water and may, thereby, somewhat or fully counteract this negative effect of the increasing abundance of small-sized fish. So far, only few studies have investigated the interactive effects of fish and bivalves on water clarity and macrophyte growth. We conducted a 2 × 2 factorial designed outdoor mesocosm experiment with two densities of small crucian carp Carassius carassius (low 10 g m−2 and high 40 g m−2) and two densities of bivalves Corbicula fluminea (low 204 g m−2 and high 816 g m−2). We found significant interactive effect of fish and bivalves on the growth of the macrophyte Vallisneria natans. In the low density bivalve regime, the relative growth rates, root mass, root:shoot ratio and number of tubers were 30.3%, 30.8%, 21.6% and 27.8% lower in the high than in the low density fish treatments, while the decrease was less pronounced in the high density bivalve regime: 1.2%, 8.7%, 2.1% and 13.3%, respectively. Thus, bivalves reduced the negative effects of fish, not least when bivalve density was high. The weaker effects of small fish on plants in the high- than in the low-density C. fluminea regime can be attributed to lower total suspended solids (TSS) and Chl a in the first week of the experiment. Better light conditions further stimulated the growth of benthic algae, potentially increasing the removal of nutrients from the water and reducing fish-driven resuspension of the sediment. In addition, high densities of C. fluminea also enriched the sediment total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) content, favouring plant growth as indicated by an increase in leaf tissue TN and TP contents. Our results demonstrate that filter-feeding bivalves can alleviate harmful effects of small fish by prolonging a clear-water state that facilitates submerged macrophyte growth. Addition of the bivalve C. fluminea can be a promising tool for the restoration of submerged macrophytes in shallow eutrophic lakes, in particular lakes containing small, rapidly reproducing fish that due to their small sizes are not capable of controlling the bivalves.

T1  - Assessing Evolutionary Significant Units (ESU) of the Endangered Freshwater Pearl Mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) in Southeast Norway on the Basis of Genetic Analysis
AN  - 2441971875
AB  - A total of 312 specimens of freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera) were sampled from 11 populations, located in four different river systems in Southeast Norway, and analyzed for 11 simple sequence repeat (SSR) (microsatellite) markers. All study populations have landlocked brown trout (Salmo trutta) as the only possible host. Several populations had experienced recruitment failure, probably due to low pH (about 6.0) and calcium concentration. STRUCTURE clustering analysis revealed two genetic clusters, of which one cluster occurred mainly in the western river systems, and totally dominated in one population (Fallselva (A-FAL)) that had higher genetic diversity than the others. Cluster 2 completely dominated in the populations of the eastern river systems, and all of them had low genetic diversity. Bottleneck events were indicated in all populations and the inbreeding coefficient FIS was significant in all populations, except for the southernmost population (Sørkedalselva (B-SØR)), which was the only population with genotypes in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. FIS were especially high in the populations of the eastern river systems, and maximum shell length was negatively correlated to FIS. If artificially breeding and stocking should become necessary for future preservation, it should be based on single populations; alternatively, the eastern populations should be based on cross-breeding of populations within the cluster to increase their genetic diversity.

T1  - Restoration of Wavy-Rayed Lampmussel (Lampsilis fasciola), Spike (Eurynia dilatata), and Rainbow Mussel (Villosa iris) to Their Native Range in the Oconaluftee River Basin of Cherokee, North Carolina
AN  - 2437111064
AB  - The Wavy-rayed Lampmussel (Lampsilis fasciola) and Spike (Eurynia dilatata) are state Species of Special Concern and Rainbow Mussels (Villosa iris) are Threatened in North Carolina. Once common in their native range, which reached across most of the Eastern United States, agricultural pollution, siltation, and river impoundments have led to sharp declines in abundance of these invertebrates. A previous feasibility study confirmed that L. fasciola and V. iris could survive and grow in enclosures in the Oconaluftee River within the Qualla Boundary, and therefore concluded that these species would be good candidates for restoration in that system. This study pursued the next step in the efforts to restore populations of these organisms by introducing individuals of L. fasciola, V. iris, and E. dilatata, back into the Oconaluftee. Juveniles of V. iris and L. fasciola were obtained from the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission’s Conservation Aquaculture Center in Marion, NC; these juveniles were raised from the glochidia of adults collected from the Little Tennessee River, where some populations of both species persist. Adult E. dilatata were collected directly from the Little Tennessee River, as this species is not currently cultured under hatchery conditions. The individuals of all three species were marked and stocked at four study sites chosen based on adequate substrate types for mussel survival. Adequate substrate included small cobbles, some fines and sand, but low siltation. Sampling took place over the course of one growing season (May to October 2019) to record survival and growth. Additionally, measurements of the remaining silo populations from the previous feasibility study were continued, as well as monitoring of an additional three new silos at each site, to allow comparison of growth in free-living mussels and those in the enclosures. We concluded that the free-living mussels could survive, and that they showed significantly greater growth than those held in enclosures. All three species had near-perfect survival when stocked into the substrate or placed in silos, with the exception of those in silos lost during storm events. Additionally, we detected positive growth for all species, which differed among sites with individuals growing less at upstream sites for both L. fasciola and V. iris. Furthermore, free-living individuals showed significantly lower valve damage than those held in silos.

T1  - An Assessment and Characterization of Legacy and Emerging Contaminants in the Great Lakes Basin Coastal Zone
AN  - 2432842647
AB  - The assessment and characterization of emerging and legacy contaminants occurrence and distribution in coastal freshwater systems is often complex and challenging. As these compounds are detected in various coastal environmental matrices, their persistence and toxicological endpoints creates growing concern and their potential risks warrant added assessment of their likely drivers and sources. In this study, a suite of legacy (historical) and emerging contaminants were assessed and characterized at select Great Lakes National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) Mussel Watch Program (MWP) sites based on a multi-matrix approach, in an attempt to identify and examine the likely drivers behind the occurrence and distribution of these contaminants and their relationship to land-use gradients at both site and watershed scales, and their proximity to point sources (e.g., WWTPs and STPs). 
          Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were detected at all Great Lakes mussel study sites and their concentrations varied significantly among sampling locations, site land-use categories, and sites sampled upstream, sites in proximate location to point sources and sites downstream and along gradients of wastewater discharges. Elevated PPCP concentrations were detected in mussels sampled at designated low-developed sites, followed by urban and open-water sites, with concentrations detected 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher at some low-developed, urban and open-water sites. Proximity to point source discharges played an integral role in controlling PPCP composition and concentration (magnitude), with elevated concentration detected in agricultural influenced watershed riverine systems impacted by complex wastewater and combined sewer overflow (CSO) systems. Equally important, both legacy and current-use pesticides (CUPs) were ubiquitously detected as complex mixtures in mussels, clams and POCIS devices, at all sampled nested sites in the lower Maumee and Ottawa riverine systems. Residual pesticide frequency, magnitude and composition varied significantly by matrix type, compound group, site types and site and sub-watershed land-use categories. 
          The results from this study indicate that PPCPs and residual pesticides detected at sampling locations within Great Lakes Basin coastal zone watersheds and associated riverine systems are occurring as complex mixtures and their effects on non-targeted organisms and biota is unknown. The results presented will serve as an initial assessment to characterize various suites of legacy and emerging contaminants that had the highest probability of being detected in tissue as well as POCIS devices, and identify what methods could be used in the future to support the validity of ongoing contaminant assessment and classification at select Great Lakes MWP sites.

T1  - Toxicity of Carbon, Silicon, and Metal-Based Nanoparticles to the Hemocytes of Three Marine Bivalves
AN  - 2408293189
AB  - Nanoparticles (NPs) have broad applications in medicine, cosmetics, optics, catalysis, environmental purification, and other areas nowadays. With increasing annual production of NPs, the risks of their harmful influence on the environment and human health are also increasing. Currently, our knowledge about the mechanisms of the interaction between NPs and living organisms is limited. The marine species and their habitat environment are under continuous stress owing to the anthropogenic activities, which result in the release of NPs in the aquatic environment. We used a bioassay model with hemocytes of three bivalve mollusc species, namely, Crenomytilus grayanus, Modiolus modiolus, and Arca boucardi, to evaluate the toxicity of 10 different types of NPs. Specifically, we compared the cytotoxic effects and cell-membrane polarization changes in the hemocytes exposed to carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, silicon nanotubes, cadmium and zinc sulfides, Au-NPs, and TiO2 NPs. Viability and the changes in hemocyte membrane polarization were measured by the flow cytometry method. The highest aquatic toxicity was registered for metal-based NPs, which caused cytotoxicity to the hemocytes of all the studied bivalve species. Our results also highlighted different sensitivities of the used tested mollusc species to specific NPs.

T1  - Free or Protein-Bound Microcystin Accumulation by Freshwater Bivalves as a Tool to Evaluate Water Contamination by Microcystin-Producing Cyanobacteria?
AN  - 2404806180
AB  - Cyanobacterial proliferations display rapid spatiotemporal variations that can interfere in the assessment of water contamination levels by microcystins (MC), and make necessary the use of integrative tools. This study evaluates the pertinence of bivalves Anodonta anatina and Dreissena polymorpha as bioindicators of the presence of MC-producing cyanobacteria in water. Ingested MC accumulates into two fractions in bivalve tissues—the cellular free and the protein-bound fractions—both forming the total MC fraction. Mussels were exposed to the cyanobacteria Planktothrix agardhii at densities producing an equivalent of 1, 10 and 100 µg/L of intracellular MC, with the evaluation of: (i) cyanobacterial cells and MC daily intake by mussels, (ii) free and total MC kinetics in whole individuals (using all the tissues) or only in the digestive gland, during and after the exposure, (iii) bioaccumulation factors. For each species, the kinetics of the two accumulation fractions were compared to evaluate which one best reflect levels and dynamics of MC-producing cyanobacteria in water. Results showed that the dynamic of free MC in bivalve tissues better highlight the dynamic of intracellular MC in water. Using whole D. polymorpha may be appropriate to reveal and discriminate the water contamination levels above densities of cyanobacteria producing 1 µg MC/L. Digestive glands of A. anatina appeared more sensitive to reveal low environmental concentration, but without direct correlation with levels of water contamination. Further experimentations in situ are necessary to confirm those results in order to propose the use of freshwater bivalves for a biomonitoring of MC-producing cyanobacteria in fresh waters.

T1  - Factors Influencing the Distribution of Invasive Hybrid (Myriophyllum Spicatum x M. Sibiricum) Watermilfoil and Parental Taxa in Minnesota
AN  - 2384082262
AB  - Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum L.) hybridizes with the native northern watermilfoil (M. sibiricum Kom.), which raises new issues regarding management strategies to control infestations. To determine the distribution of hybrid (and coincidentally Eurasian and northern) watermilfoil in Minnesota, we sampled lakes across the state during 2017–2018 for watermilfoil. A total of 62 lakes were sampled, spanning a range of sizes and duration of invasion. Forty-three lakes contained Eurasian, 28 contained hybrid and 21 contained northern watermilfoil. Eurasian watermilfoil populations were widespread throughout the state. Hybrid populations were more commonly found in lakes in the seven county Twin Cities Metro and northern watermilfoil populations were more commonly found in lakes outside of the Metro area. We found no evidence that hybrid watermilfoil occurred in lakes environmentally different than those with Eurasian and northern watermilfoil, suggesting that hybrid watermilfoil is not associated with a unique niche. Hybrid watermilfoil presence was significantly associated with the Metro area, which may likely be due to spatial and temporal factors associated with hybrid formation and spread. Hybrid watermilfoil presence was also significantly associated with lakes that had more parking spaces and older infestations, but this relationship was not significant when the effect of region was considered. Hybrid watermilfoil populations were the result of both in situ hybridization and clonal spread and continued assessment is needed to determine if particularly invasive or herbicide-resistant genotypes develop.

T1  - Physiological and Metabolic Responses of Marine Mussels Exposed to Toxic Cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa and Chrysosporum ovalisporum
AN  - 2382401218
AB  - Toxic cyanobacterial blooms are a major contaminant in inland aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, toxic blooms are carried downstream by rivers and waterways to estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Concerning marine and estuarine animal species, very little is known about how these species are affected by the exposure to freshwater cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. So far, most of the knowledge has been gathered from freshwater bivalve molluscs. This work aimed to infer the sensitivity of the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis to single as well as mixed toxic cyanobacterial cultures and the underlying molecular responses mediated by toxic cyanobacteria. For this purpose, a mussel exposure experiment was outlined with two toxic cyanobacteria species, Microcystis aeruginosa and Chrysosporum ovalisporum at 1 × 105 cells/mL, resembling a natural cyanobacteria bloom. The estimated amount of toxins produced by M. aeruginosa and C. ovalisporum were respectively 0.023 pg/cell of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and 7.854 pg/cell of cylindrospermopsin (CYN). After 15 days of exposure to single and mixed cyanobacteria, a depuration phase followed, during which mussels were fed only non-toxic microalga Parachlorella kessleri. The results showed that the marine mussel is able to filter toxic cyanobacteria at a rate equal or higher than the non-toxic microalga P. kessleri. Filtration rates observed after 15 days of feeding toxic microalgae were 1773.04 mL/ind.h (for M. aeruginosa), 2151.83 mL/ind.h (for C. ovalisporum), 1673.29 mL/ind.h (for the mixture of the 2 cyanobacteria) and 2539.25 mL/ind.h (for the non-toxic P. kessleri). Filtering toxic microalgae in combination resulted in the accumulation of 14.17 ng/g dw MC-LR and 92.08 ng/g dw CYN. Other physiological and biochemical endpoints (dry weight, byssus production, total protein and glycogen) measured in this work did not change significantly in the groups exposed to toxic cyanobacteria with regard to control group, suggesting that mussels were not affected with the toxic microalgae. Nevertheless, proteomics revealed changes in metabolism of mussels related to diet, specially evident in those fed on combined cyanobacteria. Changes in metabolic pathways related with protein folding and stabilization, cytoskeleton structure, and gene transcription/translation were observed after exposure and feeding toxic cyanobacteria. These changes occur in vital metabolic processes and may contribute to protect mussels from toxic effects of the toxins MC-LR and CYN.

T1  - Zooplankton Community Responses to Oxygen Stress
AN  - 2375423620
AB  - Recent changes in climate and eutrophication have caused increases in oxygen depletion in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. However, the impact of oxygen stress on zooplankton, which is the major trophic link between primary producers and fish, remains largely unknown in lakes. Therefore, we studied 41 lakes with different trophic and oxygen conditions to assess the role of oxygen stress on zooplankton communities and carbon transfer between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Samples were collected from each lake at the peak of summer stratification from three depth layers (the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion). Our results revealed that freshwater zooplankton were relatively tolerant to anoxic conditions and the greatest changes in community structure were found in lakes with the highest oxygen deficits. This caused a switch in dominance from large to small species and reduced the zooplankton biomass in lower, anoxic layers of water, but not in the upper layers of water where the oxygen deficits began. This upper anoxic layer could thus be a very important refuge for zooplankton to avoid predation during the day. However, the reduction of zooplankton in the lower water layers was the main factor that reduced the effectiveness of carbon transfer between the phytoplankton and zooplankton.

T1  - Causes and consequences of individual variation in animal movement
AN  - 2357253525
AB  - Animal movement comes in a variety of ‘types’ including small foraging movements, larger one-way dispersive movements, seasonally-predictable round-trip migratory movements, and erratic nomadic movements. Although most individuals move at some point throughout their lives, movement patterns can vary widely across individuals within the same species: differing within an individual over time (intra-individual), among individuals in the same population (inter-individual), or among populations (inter-population). Yet, studies of movement (theoretical and empirical alike) more often focus on understanding ‘typical’ movement patterns than understanding variation in movement. Here, I synthesize current knowledge of movement variation (drawing parallels across species and movement types), describing the causes (what factors contribute to individual variation), patterns (what movement variation looks like), consequences (why variation matters), maintenance (why variation persists), implications (for management and conservation), and finally gaps (what pieces we are currently missing). By synthesizing across scales of variation, I span across work on plasticity, personality, and geographic variation. Individual movement can be driven by factors that act at the individual, population, community and ecosystem level and have ramifications at each of these levels. Generally the consequences of movement are less well understood than the causes, in part because the effects of movement variation are often nested, with variation manifesting at the population level, which in turn affects communities and ecosystems. Understanding both cause and consequence is particularly important for predicting when variation begets variation in a positive feedback loop, versus when a negative feedback causes variation to be dampened successively. Finally, maintaining standing variation in movement may be important for facilitating species’ ability to respond to future environmental change.

In part this is because separating biological effects from purely physical mechanisms has been little studied and yet could help predict potentially damaging bioinvasions. Here we tested the effects of a large bio-engineering fanworm Sabella spallanzanii (Sabella) versus worm-like structures (mimics) on gas and nutrient fluxes in a marine soft bottom sediment. Experimental plots of sediment in Hauraki Gulf (New Zealand) were used to test the hypothesis that ecosystem engineers negatively influence benthic ecosystem function through autogenic mechanisms, facilitating activity by biofouling organisms and competitive exclusion of native infauna. Enhanced physical structure associated with Sabella and mimics increased nitrogen fluxes, community metabolism and reduced denitrification from 23 μmol m−2 h−1 to zero at densities greater than 25 m2. Sabella plots on average had greater respiration (29%), NH4 release (33%), and greater NO3 release (52%) compared to mimics, suggesting allogenic (biological) mechanisms occur, but play a secondary role to autogenic (physical) mechanisms. The dominance of autogenic mechanisms indicates that bio-engineers are likely to cause significant impacts when established, regardless of fundamental differences in recipient regions or identity of the introduced bio-engineer. In the case of Sabella spallanzanii, compromised denitrification has the potential to tip the balance of net solute and gas exchanges and cause further ecological degradation in an already eutrophic system.

T1  - Effects of Corbicula fluminea on the nutrient concentration and phytoplankton biomass of tropical reservoirs
AN  - 2623487927
AB  - Invasive bivalves are known to negatively impact aquatic ecosystems across the globe. Previous research has demonstrated invasive bivalves can shift nutrients from the water column to the sediment, harm native bivalves, and reduce phytoplankton biomass. However, bivalve effects vary with species and the region where the invasion occurs. Therefore, we used mesocosm experiments to examine the impact of invasive Corbicula fluminea on nutrient concentration and phytoplankton biomass in the water column of mesotrophic and eutrophic Puerto Rican reservoirs. We used four treatments to determine the effect of C. fluminea on the water column. We found C. fluminea did not have a significant effect on the ammonium, nitrate, or phosphorus concentration in either the mesotrophic or eutrophic mesocosm experiments. Additionally, C. fluminea presence did not significantly alter phytoplankton biomass, though Synedra dominated the phytoplankton community when C. fluminea were absent. While C. fluminea may not have caused an effect in the water column as it was potentially phytoplankton limited, the mesocosm experiment conditions reflect the natural environment, indicating phytoplankton limitation could be an issue in the reservoirs. Our findings suggest C. fluminea does not have a large effect on nutrient concentration or phytoplankton biomass in eutrophic and mesotrophic Puerto Rican reservoirs. This study represents the first effort to examine the effects of C. fluminea presence on the water column of a tropical reservoir.

He has been actively involved with several societies, in particular, the Malacological Society of Australasia, and edited their journal, Molluscan Research, for 13 years (until last Dec.). He has served on several committees, including the Australian Biological Resources Survey (ABRS) Advisory Committee for six years. His research interests centre on molluscan morphology, systematics, and phylogenetics, especially of gastropods. He has also been involved in the conservation of invertebrates, and his recent research is focused on the biology and systematics of freshwater and estuarine molluscs of Australia and the region as well as the aquatic invertebrate fauna of springs associated with the Australian Great Artesian Basin. He co-edited a book on the phylogeny of molluscs with D. Lindberg (2008) and has edited three other books and, to date, is the author of 247 reviewed publications. He is also involved in the production of interactive keys to marine and freshwater molluscs. 
David R. Lindberg is Professor Emeritus of Integrative Biology, Curator Emeritus in the UC Museum of Paleontology, and a former member of the Center for Computational Biology at UC Berkeley. He is a former Chair of the Department of Integrative Biology, Director of the UC Museum of Paleontology, and Chair of the UC Berkeley Natural History Museums. He has authored over 125 peer-reviewed papers and edited or authored 3 books on the evolutionary history of nearshore marine organisms and their habitats. At Berkeley, he served as major advisor to 21 Ph.D graduate students and 6 post-doctoral researchers. In addition to providing graduate seminars in evolution and organismal biology, he regularly taught a marine mammal course, an invertebrate zoology course with laboratories, and 2 semester principals of phylogenetics course. Prof. Lindberg has conducted research and fieldwork along the rocky shores of the Pacific Rim for over 40 years. In addition to his research and teaching, Prof. Lindberg was actively involved in K・16 outreach projects at the UC Museum of Paleontology, and focused on the use of the Internet to increase access to scientific resources, and the training of teachers in principles of evolutionary biology, science, and global change.

T1  - The effect of bivalve filtration on eDNA-based detection of aquatic organisms
AN  - 2314307897
AB  - As the use of environmental-DNA (eDNA) expands as a method to detect the presence and quantity of aquatic taxa, factors potentially impacting the efficacy of this technique must be investigated. Many studies have examined the effects of abiotic parameters on the degradation of environmental-DNA (e.g. UV radiation, pH, temperature, etc.), however, few have focused on biotic effectors. Through high-filtering rates coupled with dense colonization, Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) are able to drastically alter the quantity of particulate matter through translocation into the sediment, potentially including sources of eDNA in lotic and lentic systems. Using a longitudinal, laboratory experiment, we tested the effect of varying densities of Asian clams on the translocation rate of common goldfish (Carassius auratus) DNA. Target DNA in testing tanks was quantified through quantitative PCR (qPCR) at regular intervals and compared. Tanks housing the highest density of Asian clams produced significantly lower DNA concentrations over time compared to tanks of lower densities. These results show, for the first time, a density-dependent reduction of local eDNA sources by bivalve filtration that may lead to the obstructed detection of target species through the sampling of eDNA. Based on these findings, we recommend highly concentrated bivalve populations be taken into consideration when choosing the time and locality of eDNA sampling efforts.

T1  - Sexual dimorphism, asymmetry, and allometry in the shell shape of Modiolus metcalfei (Hanley, 1843) collected from Dumangas, Iloilo, Philippines: A geometric morphometric approach
AN  - 2283952656
AB  - The shell is the most conspicuous and variable part of a bivalve and is largely affected by environmental conditions. Thus, this study was conducted to describe the changes in the shell shape of the horse mussel Modiolus metcalfei from Dumangas, Iloilo. Allometric changes in shape, sex-induced shape differences, and asymmetry were investigated using geometric morphometric methods. A total of 12 landmarks where used to obtain biological shape information from 60 horse mussel individuals. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences of shell shapes between sexes (Wilk's lamda=0.01, p=1.26E-219). Generally, males have an expanded shell but compressed mid-shell region while females have compressed shell but expanded mid- and postero-ventral region. Moreover, the multivariate regression of shape on centroid size was statistically significant (p less than 0.001, Goodall's F-test). Smaller individuals were slender and elongate while larger individuals were slightly rounded and curved.Furthermore, directional and fluctuating asymmetry were highly significant (p less than 0.0001, Procrustes ANOVA), indicating developmental instability probably caused by the ecological health of the coastal waters of Dumangas, Iloilo. The differences in shape between sexes were attributed to the differences in reproductive roles while allometric shell morphology changes reflected its adaptation to the environment.

T1  - The Assessment and Management of Marine Pest Risks Posed by Shipping: The Australian and New Zealand Experience
AN  - 2308243530
AB  - Ships have been translocating species around the world for hundreds of years but attempts to understand and manage this issue date back only three decades. Here we review the assessment and management of risks from vessel biofouling and ballast water over this time period from an Australian and New Zealand perspective. We detail a history of successes and failures at the science-policy interface that include international guidelines for biofouling management and the recent ratification of a ballast water convention. We summarise the efficacy and costs of current treatment options, and highlight the practical challenges and policy implications of managing the diffuse and succinct bio-invasion risks that shipping creates pre- and post-border. We then use the lessons learnt over the last 30 years to recommend a future empirical strategy.

T1  - Hypoxia causes woodlice (Porcellio scaber) to select lower temperatures and impairs their thermal performance and heat tolerance
AN  - 2267785141
AB  - Environmental temperatures and oxygen availability are important for the balance between oxygen supply and demand. Terrestrial organisms are generally perceived to be less limited by access to oxygen than their aquatic counterparts. Nevertheless, even terrestrial environments can be deficient in oxygen, especially for organisms occurring in soil, litter, wood, rotten fruit or at high elevations. While isopods are the best adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle among crustaceans, many species, including woodlice, occupy environmental gradients of temperature and oxygen. To investigate whether mismatches between oxygen supply and demand can result in a loss of performance in a terrestrial organism, we studied the effects of atmospheric oxygen concentration on the thermal performance of the common rough woodlouse (Porcellio scaber). We compared the thermal preference, thermal sensitivity of running speed, and tolerance to extreme temperatures of woodlice exposed to one of two oxygen concentrations (21% - normoxia, 7% - hypoxia). Under hypoxia, P. scaber preferred microhabitats with temperatures that were on average 3°C lower than those preferred under normoxia. The running speed tended to reach its maximum at a lower temperature under hypoxia than under normoxia (25.13°C vs 28.87°C, respectively, although p was equal to 0.09), and normoxic woodlice ran approximately 1.5-fold faster than hypoxic woodlice at the point of maximum speed. Heat tolerance was significantly lower under hypoxia (38.9°C) than under normoxia (40.7°C), but there was no difference in cold tolerance (5.81°C under normoxia and 5.44°C under hypoxia). Overall, our results indicate that environmental gradients of temperature and oxygen may shape the physiological performance of terrestrial ectotherms, likely via their effects on the balance between oxygen supply and demand, which may have fitness consequences for these organisms in nature.

T1  - An investigation of the effects of conservation incentive programs on management of invasive species by private landowners
AN  - 2348242009
AB  - Invasive species are a large and growing threat to biodiversity and ecosystem service provisioning globally as well as in southern Ontario, Canada's most biodiverse region. As in many other world regions, most land in southern Ontario is privately owned and therefore conservation programs that aim at private lands are important. Conservation incentive programs that target private lands are increasingly popular, but little is known about their effectiveness in achieving conservation objectives. To address this knowledge gap, we used a large survey of 1,200 Ontario landowners to investigate how successful conservation incentive programs are at motivating landowners to engage in invasive species management. Utilizing a quasi‐experimental approach, we surveyed landowners participating in the Conservation Lands Tax Incentive Program (CLTIP), the Managed Forest Tax Incentive Program (MFTIP), or in both programs, as well as landowners who were program eligible but did not participate. Our results demonstrate the differential effects of participation in the two programs on specific landowner conservation behaviors: While participation in the MFTIP increased the likelihood of removing invasive species by a factor 2.5 and the planting of native species by a factor 4.3, participants in the CLTIP were no more likely to engage in these behaviors than landowners who did not participate in either program. We suggest that this behavioral disparity is due to the differences in the program designs: The CLTIP does not require a management plan, favors a short planning horizon, and mainly encourages passive management; in doing so it essentially breaks the causal chain that reinforces landowners' environmental awareness and a sense of responsibility for taking conservation actions. Our recommendations include requirements for impact evaluations of private land conservation incentive programs to ensure they achieve stated program outcomes, as well as conservation incentive program designs that oblige landowners to actively manage their land over longer time horizons.

T1  - Biological control of invasive fish and aquatic invertebrates: a brief review with case studies
AN  - 2285116744
AB  - We review various applications of biocontrol for invasive fish and aquatic invertebrates. We adopt a broader definition of biocontrol that includes traditional methods like predation and physical removal (biocontrol by humans), and modern approaches like genetic engineering and use of microbes (including pathogens). While physical removal and predation (by native predators) are used relatively commonly, use of genetic technologies and microbes is in developmental stages. The two latter strategies are most advanced in case of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio), one of the world’s most invasive fish; virus release to control carp might soon occur in Australia. Drawing from empirical examples in North America, we emphasize that biocontrol strategies are most likely to be successful if they include multiple approaches that target specific behaviors or weaknesses in pests’ life histories. This is illustrated by reviewing case studies on the common carp and rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) in Midwestern North America. In case of the common carp, basic research on movement patterns and recruitment bottlenecks identified a strategy where winter aggregations of adults were targeted for removal with nets, while native predators of carp eggs and larvae were instrumental in controlling carp’s reproductive success. In the case of the rusty crayfish, basic research on interactions between crayfish, habitat, and native predators identified a successful strategy of stocking selected native predators to control juvenile crayfish in conjunction with physical removal of adult crayfish using traps. We are also reviewing the case of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) in the Great Lakes. In this example, multiple pieces of evidence (diet, bioenergetics) illustrate how initially abundant pest was brought under control (in some areas) by several species of native predators in a large, natural ecosystem. Overall, examples of successful biocontrol of aquatic pests have been rare and have relied on physical removal and predation. We expect that new technologies (e.g. genetic technologies) will occur in the next decade but will have to clear regulatory and ethical concerns before they are applied. While developing more sophisticated control techniques, we advocate for more basic research on the life history of the pests to identify behavioral or developmental weaknesses that could be targeted with specific tools to increase chances of success while minimizing impacts on native ecosystems.

T1  - The economic value of mussel farming for uncertain nutrient removal in the Baltic Sea
AN  - 2240299563
AB  - Mussel farming has been recognised as a low cost option for mitigating damage caused by eutrophication in the Baltic Sea. However, uncertain nutrient removal owing to weather and environmental conditions at the mussel farm site has not been previously considered. The purpose of this study was to estimate whether mussel farming has cost advantages even in conditions of uncertainty. To this end, the replacement cost method was used for the valuation of ecosystem services and a numerical cost minimisation model was constructed based on the safety-first approach to account for uncertainty in nutrient removal. This study showed that the value of mussel farming depends on the cost at the farm, and the impact on the mean and variability of nutrient removal in relation to other abatement measures. The study also pointed out the need of data on the decision makers’ risk attitudes and measurement of uncertainty. The application to the Baltic Sea showed that the total value of mussel farming increased from 0.34 billion Euro/year to 0.41 or 1.21 billion Euro when accounting for uncertainty depending on assumption of probability distribution. The increase was unevenly distributed between the Baltic Sea countries, with it found to be lower for countries equipped with highly productive mussel farms and long coastlines.

T1  - Better biosecurity: spread-prevention of the invasive Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774)
AN  - 2285118530
AB  - Aquatic invasive species (AIS) negatively impact freshwater ecosystems on a global scale. As management options for control and eradication of established AIS populations are often complex, costly and resource-intensive, spread-prevention protocols are considered essential. The Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774), is considered a high-impact successful invader that can adversely alter freshwater habitats, community dynamics and ecosystem function. Accordingly, we examine the efficacy of a range of biosecurity techniques, including recommended (aquatic disinfectants, bleach and salt solutions) and more novel (hot water and direct steam) approaches, to induce adult C. fluminea mortality. In separate experiments, C. fluminea were submerged at 12 °C for up to 80 minutes in: 1) 2% and 4% solutions of Virasure® Aquatic and Virkon® Aquatic; 2) warm (30 °C) 2% and 4% solutions of these disinfectants; and 3) 10% and 20% bleach solutions. Furthermore, specimens were exposed to: 4) 30% and 70% salt solutions (NaCl) for up to 72 hrs; 5) hot water (35, 40 and 45 °C) for up to 20 minutes; and 6), direct steam exposure for up to 10 minutes. Adult C. fluminea were found to be largely resistant to aquatic disinfectants, bleach and salt solutions, with ≤ 58% mortality achieved at the maximum exposure times. However, immersion in hot water (≥ 45 °C) and direct steam exposure for five minutes and 30 seconds, respectively, rapidly caused mortality. Accordingly, simple biosecurity protocols that cause thermal shock appear highly effective. We discuss the need for further examination of biosecurity protocols across all life stages of current, emerging and potential AIS, and provide guidance for improving biosecurity practices.

T1  - Predicting the effects of reintroducing a native predator (European eel, Anguilla anguilla) into a freshwater community dominated by alien species using a multidisciplinary approach
AN  - 2285117632
AB  - Multiple introductions of alien species can lead to the formation of new and diverse communities with diverse interactions, particularly in isolated freshwater ecosystems. In Lake Arréo (currently known as Caicedo-Yuso), located in Basque Country, Northern Spain, the introduction of several North American species (largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus and the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii) and the common carp Cyprinus carpio has resulted in a unique community composed mainly of alien species. Previous efforts to eradicate them by intensive fishing/trapping have failed. Reintroduction of native predators could represent a complementary method, with an added biodiversity value. The reintroduction of the European eel Anguilla anguilla could lead to an increased predation on crayfish as shown by previous studies, but also affects the abundance of juvenile fish. To investigate the current situation of Lake Arreo, stable isotope analyses were conducted using 15 muscle tissue samples per each fish and crayfish species, while stomach contents of the same species were analysed. Additionally, samples from the common reed Phragmites australis, the trophically lowest food source available for fish and crayfish species, were collected and used as baseline for the isotope analysis. To investigate the usefulness of stable isotopes to predict the effects of species reintroductions on present species communities, available stable isotope and diet data from A. anguilla in a German freshwater lake with a similar species composition were retrieved and included in the Arreo community analysis. While results from both, dietary and stable isotope analyses, indicate high interactions among alien species with P. clarkii having a central position, the modelled reintroduction of A. anguilla shows to possibly affect recruits of alien fish species as well as an increased feeding of M. salmoides on reintroduced eels.

T1  - Structure and genetic variability of golden mussel ( Limnoperna fortunei ) populations from Brazilian reservoirs
AN  - 2188803848
AB  - The golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei a highly invasive species in Brazil, has generated productive, economical, and biological impacts. To evaluate genetic structure and variability of L. fortunei populations present in fish farms in the reservoirs of Canoas I (CANFF), Rosana (ROSFF), and Capivara (CAPFF) (Paranapanema River, Paraná, Brazil), eight microsatellite loci were amplified. Five of those eight loci resulted in 38 alleles. The observed heterozygosity (Ho) was lower than the expected heterozygosity (He) in all populations, with a deviation from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The average value for the inbreeding coefficient (Fis) was positive and significative for all populations. There was higher genetic variability within populations than among them. The fixation index (Fst) showed a small genetic variability among these populations. The occurrence of gene flow was identified in all populations, along with the lack of a recent bottleneck effect. The clustering analysis yielded K = 2, with genetic similarity between the three populations. The results demonstrate low genetic structure and suggest a founding population with greater genetic variability (ROSFF). Our data point to the possible dispersal of L. fortunei aided by anthropic factors in the upstream direction. It was concluded that the three populations presented a unique genetic pool for Paranapanema River, with occurrence of gene flow.

T1  - Managing Eutrophication in the Szczecin (Oder) Lagoon-Development, Present State and Future Perspectives
AN  - 2308104692
AB  - High riverine nutrient loads caused poor water quality, low water transparency and an unsatisfactory ecological status in the Szczecin (Oder) Lagoon, a trans-boundary water at the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. Total annual riverine N (P) loads into the lagoon raised at the 20th century from approx. 14,000~t~TN (1,000~t~TP) to 115,000~t~TN (10,500~t~TP) in the 1980ties and declined to about 56,750~t~TN (2,800~t~TP) after 2010. Nutrient concentrations, water transparency (Secchi depth) and chlorophyll-a showed a positive response to the reduced nutrient loads in the Polish eastern lagoon. This was not the case in the German western lagoon, where summer Secchi depth is 0.6 m and mean chlorophyll-a concentration is four times above the threshold for the Good Ecological Status. Measures to improve the water quality focused until now purely on nutrient load reductions, but the nutrient load targets and Maximal Allowable Inputs are contradicting between EU Water Framework Directive and EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. According to the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan, the thresholds of the annual riverine nutrient inputs to the lagoon would be about 48,850~t~N (1,570~t~P). Actions in the river basins that would allow meeting these targets are hardly achievable. Even if the load targets would be fully implemented, they are not sufficient to transfer the lagoon into a non-eutrophic state. The implementation of EU Water Framework Directive is further hampered, as consistent water quality thresholds for the two parts of Szczecin Lagoon are missing. An approach to harmonize them is presented, which incorporates the spatial differences. By implementing consistent water quality targets, Szczecin Lagoon could serve as blueprint for other trans-boundary waters. In the western lagoon, nutrient load reductions in the past decades had no effect on the water quality. High water residence times, frequent sediment resuspension and the missing submerged vegetation inhibit the load reduction effects on the water quality. Internal measures in the western lagoon are necessary, which aim at removing nutrients and$\/$ or increasing water transparency to overcome the hysteresis effect and to initiate a recovery of macrophytes. The most promising approach seems the cultivation of zebra mussels.

T1  - Opportunities and Challenges for the Sustainability of Lakes and Reservoirs in Relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
AN  - 2652784487
AB  - Emerging global threats, such as biological invasions, climate change, land use intensification, and water depletion, endanger the sustainable future of lakes and reservoirs. To deal with these threats, a multidimensional view on the protection and exploitation of lakes and reservoirs is needed. The holistic approach needs to contain not just the development of economy and society but also take into account the negative impacts of this growth on the environment, from that, the balance between the three dimensions can be sustained to reach a sustainable future. As such, this paper provides a comprehensive review on future opportunities and challenges for the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs via a critical analysis on their contribution to individual and subsets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, lakes and reservoirs are key freshwater resources. They play crucial roles in human societies for drinking water provision, food production (via fisheries, aquaculture, and the irrigation of agricultural lands), recreation, energy provision (via hydropower dams), wastewater treatment, and flood and drought control. Because of the (mostly) recent intensive exploitations, many lakes and reservoirs are severely deteriorated. In recent years, physical (habitat) degradation has become very important while eutrophication remains the main issue for many lakes and ponds worldwide. Besides constant threats from anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, industry, aquaculture, and watercourse alterations, climate change and emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobial resistance, can generate a global problem for the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs. In relation to the SDGs, the actions for achieving the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs have positive links with the SDGs related to environmental dimensions (Goals 6, 13, 14, and 15) as they are mutually reinforcing each other. On the other hand, these actions have direct potential conflicts with the SDGs related to social and economic dimensions (Goals 1, 2, 3 and 8). From these interlinkages, we propose 22 indicators that can be used by decision makers for monitoring and assessing the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs.

T1  - Diets and Trophic Structure of Fish Assemblages in a Large and Unexplored Subtropical River: The Uruguay River
AN  - 2550492419
AB  - The Neotropics represent a hotspot for freshwater biodiversity with vast number of fish species of scarce ecological knowledge. This holds true for the Uruguay River, where fish assemblages and their diets remain unexplored. Fish assemblages were surveyed in 14 sites along the river main course, from headwaters to mouth (approximately 1800 km), with the aim to identify the trophic roles of fishes and to describe trophic structure of these assemblages, following standardized sampling campaigns and laboratory procedures. One hundred species (2309 gut contents) were analysed and classified into four trophic groups subdivided into eight lower-level groups: Piscivore, piscivore-invertivore, detritivore, omnivore-detritivore, omnivore-invertivore, omnivore-planktivore and omnivore-herbivore. The trophic structure of the assemblages varied along the river, with the relative species richness of fish consuming terrestrial invertebrates increasing towards the middle river section, probably driven by the large floodplains in that areas, supporting global theories such as the flood pulse concept. This study describes the feeding habits of fish along the Uruguay River, being the first dietary description for 29 species. This knowledge is essential for management and conservation, serving as baseline in the context of future environmental changes while generating novel evidence on the functioning of ecosystems in this scarcely studied climatic region.

T1  - Opportunities and Challenges for the Sustainability of Lakes and Reservoirs in Relation to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
AN  - 2550490161
AB  - Emerging global threats, such as biological invasions, climate change, land use intensification, and water depletion, endanger the sustainable future of lakes and reservoirs. To deal with these threats, a multidimensional view on the protection and exploitation of lakes and reservoirs is needed. The holistic approach needs to contain not just the development of economy and society but also take into account the negative impacts of this growth on the environment, from that, the balance between the three dimensions can be sustained to reach a sustainable future. As such, this paper provides a comprehensive review on future opportunities and challenges for the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs via a critical analysis on their contribution to individual and subsets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, lakes and reservoirs are key freshwater resources. They play crucial roles in human societies for drinking water provision, food production (via fisheries, aquaculture, and the irrigation of agricultural lands), recreation, energy provision (via hydropower dams), wastewater treatment, and flood and drought control. Because of the (mostly) recent intensive exploitations, many lakes and reservoirs are severely deteriorated. In recent years, physical (habitat) degradation has become very important while eutrophication remains the main issue for many lakes and ponds worldwide. Besides constant threats from anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, industry, aquaculture, and watercourse alterations, climate change and emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobial resistance, can generate a global problem for the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs. In relation to the SDGs, the actions for achieving the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs have positive links with the SDGs related to environmental dimensions (Goals 6, 13, 14, and 15) as they are mutually reinforcing each other. On the other hand, these actions have direct potential conflicts with the SDGs related to social and economic dimensions (Goals 1, 2, 3 and 8). From these interlinkages, we propose 22 indicators that can be used by decision makers for monitoring and assessing the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs.

T1  - Trophic Features, Benthic Recovery, and Dominance of the Invasive Mytilopsis Sallei in the Yundang Lagoon (Xiamen, China) Following Long-Term Restoration
AN  - 2550472480
AB  - A comprehensive set of physicochemical variables in near-bottom water and surface sediments, as well as the soft-bottom macrozoobenthic assemblages were investigated at six sites across the Yundang Lagoon (Southeast China) in November 2012. This lagoon was severely damaged in the 1970s due to domestic and industrial pollution and land reclamation and underwent a massive restoration effort over the past 30 years. Our objectives were to: (1) assess the current trophic and environmental condition of the lagoon; (2) investigate the pattern of spatial variation in the macrozoobenthic assemblages; and (3) assess the benthic recovery in relation to the main environmental gradients and the presence of invasive alien species. Nutrient, chlorophyll-a, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (CODMn), and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were lower than those reported in previous decades, yet organically-enriched conditions occurred at an inner site. From azoic conditions in the 1980s and a few benthic species reported prior to this study, we found a significant increase in benthic diversity with 43 species heterogeneously distributed across the lagoon. The invasive bivalve Mytilopsis sallei was the dominant species, which was associated with the richest benthic assemblage. However, M. sallei is a pest species, and its spatiotemporal distribution should be carefully monitored. These results highlight the central role of the macrozoobenthos in providing important ecological information on the current status of the Yundang Lagoon and as an effective biological tool to follow the recovery’s progress and the future evolution of this highly valued ecosystem.

T1  - A Multiplex Analysis of Potentially Toxic Cyanobacteria in Lake Winnipeg during the 2013 Bloom Season
AN  - 2550288064
AB  - Lake Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada), the world’s 12th largest lake by area, is host to yearly cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cHABs) dominated by Aphanizomenon and Dolichospermum. cHABs in Lake Winnipeg are primarily a result of eutrophication but may be exacerbated by the recent introduction of dreissenid mussels. Through multiple methods to monitor the potential for toxin production in Lake Winnipeg in conjunction with environmental measures, this study defined the baseline composition of a Lake Winnipeg cHAB to measure potential changes because of dreissenid colonization. Surface water samples were collected in 2013 from 23 sites during summer and from 18 sites in fall. Genetic data and mass spectrometry cyanotoxin profiles identified microcystins (MC) as the most abundant cyanotoxin across all stations, with MC concentrations highest in the north basin. In the fall, mcyA genes were sequenced to determine which species had the potential to produce MCs, and 12 of the 18 sites were a mix of both Planktothrix and Microcystis. Current blooms in Lake Winnipeg produce low levels of MCs, but the capacity to produce cyanotoxins is widespread across both basins. If dreissenid mussels continue to colonize Lake Winnipeg, a shift in physicochemical properties of the lake because of faster water column clearance rates may yield more toxic blooms potentially dominated by microcystin producers.

T1  - Using RPL Model to Probe Trade-Offs among Negative Externalities of Controlling Invasive Species
AN  - 2541325381
AB  - This empirical study uses the choice experiment method to analyze the preferences of national park (NP) visitors regarding the negative externalities of NP measures to prevent and control invasive alien species (IAS). In addition, it estimates the visitor responses to the trade-offs between various negative externalities and the prices visitors are willing to pay. Based on these trade-offs and the willing-to-pay prices, NPs can plan IAS prevention that has the least impact on visitors. Adopting visitors to Taiwan’s Shei-Pa National Park as the survey respondents, this paper uses a stratified random sampling method to select the survey time and applies systematic sampling to select respondents during the survey period. A total of 602 questionnaires and 2998 observations were obtained. The results reveal that visitors believe that the negative externalities of IAS have a significant impact on them. However, their preference for prevention and control outweighs their preference for no prevention and control measures. In terms of the negative externalities associated with IAS prevention and control, visitors award priority to avoidance of ecological disturbance and harm to visitor health, and are more likely to accept the reduction of recreational area.

T1  - Predicted Ecosystem Effects and Population Control Needs of Bigheaded Carp in Productive Southeastern Reservoirs
AN  - 2410249943
AB  - Bighead Carp Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and Silver Carp H. molitrix (collectively bigheaded carp) are established in Barkley Reservoir of the Cumberland River and Kentucky Reservoir of the Tennessee River. I developed an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model to evaluate the ecological effects of bigheaded carp on native fish community biomass, and estimate the harvest rate required for bigheaded carp control under differing levels of immigration.  The model predicted a 15-20% decrease in native fish biomass from 1978 baseline biomass levels without bigheaded carp control efforts.  High harvest levels were able to suppress bigheaded carp biomass.  Barriers limiting immigration accelerated bigheaded carps’ biomass decline and native fishes biomass recovery when commercial harvest is maintained.

T1  - Neurotoxicity, Behavior, and Lethal Effects of Cadmium, Microplastics, and Their Mixtures on Pomatoschistus microps Juveniles from Two Wild Populations Exposed under Laboratory Conditions―Implications to Environmental and Human Risk Assessment
AN  - 2329493965
AB  - Microplastics (MPs) were found to modulate the toxicity of other pollutants but the knowledge on the topic is still limited. The goals of this study were to investigate the short-term toxicity of cadmium (Cd) to wild Pomatochistus microps juveniles, the potential modulation of acute Cd toxicity by 1–5 µm polyethylene MPs in this species, and possible differences of sensitivity to Cd and MPs-Cd mixtures between juveniles from two distinct wild populations. Juveniles were collected in the estuaries of Minho (M-est) and Lima (L-est) Rivers (NW Portugal). One 96 h bioassay with M-est juveniles and another one with L-est juveniles were carried out in laboratory conditions. Each bioassay had 12 treatments: control, 5 Cd concentrations, 1 MPs concentration, and 5 MPs-Cd mixtures. No significant differences in Cd-induced mortality between juveniles from distinct estuaries or between juveniles exposed to Cd alone and those exposed to MPs-Cd mixtures were found. The total 96h LC10 and LC50 of Cd alone were 2 mg/L (95% CI: 0–4 mg/L) and 8 mg/L (95% CI: 2–17 mg/L), respectively. Cd alone significantly decreased the post-exposure predatory performance (PEPP) of M-est (≥6 mg/L) and L-est juveniles (≥3 mg/L), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity of M-est juveniles (13 mg/L). MPs alone (0.14 mg/L) significantly reduced the PEPP and AChE activity of L-est juveniles but not of M-est juveniles. MPs-Cd mixtures (3–13 mg/L of Cd + 0.14 mg/L of MPs) significantly inhibited the PEPP of juveniles from both estuaries and AChE of L-est estuary juveniles but not of M-est juveniles. Evidences of toxicological interactions, namely antagonism, between MPs and Cd were found. Overall, the results indicate that MPs modulated the sub-lethal toxic effects of Cd in wild P. microps juveniles, especially neurotoxicity. Moreover, the environmental conditions of the natural habitats to which juveniles were exposed during pre-developmental phases influence the sub-lethal toxicity of Cd, MPs, and their mixtures. The implications to environmental and human risk assessment are discussed and further research is needed.

T1  - Assessing Changes in Ecosystem Services Provision in Coastal Waters
AN  - 2322186713
AB  - [...]the objectives of this article are (1) to test the suitability of the MESAT to cover all inner and outer coastal water bodies defined by the WFD; (2) to test its usability along connected systems with different physical gradients and anthropogenic factors, emphasizing lessons learned from the assessments for connected systems; (3) to identify driving factors that influence its applicability in other regions. 2.

[...]one weakness identified in MESAT is that by using the average it gives the same weight for all components, meaning that one service which is represented by only one indicator has the same weight as a service represented by five [23].

Besides the average, and aiming at improving the aggregation process of MESAT, this study developed two new indices, (1) the weighted index based on the number of categories of change from the previous hierarchical level and (2) the weighted index including the reliability score of each indicator used.

According to the case study characteristics, Szczecin Lagoon and Greifswald Bay, with lower salinities and higher water residence times, showed a decrease of provisioning ES compared to the Pomeranian Bay which has higher salinity and short water residence time.

In MESAT the initial status corresponds to “good” or better ecological conditions of a water body, and it is defined by adding 50% of nutrient concentration from a reference period according to the WFD [8,39].

Since for all water bodies reference conditions are defined by the member states, and this is a publicly accepted and accessible information, it is in principle possible to define an initial status in other European regions as well.

AN  - 2316395367
AB  - The Ottawa River is Canada’s eighth largest river and the chief tributary of the St. Lawrence. Beginning in the Laurentian Mountains, it flows west before turning southeast to form a portion of the border between Ontario and Quebec. It drains an area twice the size of New Brunswick. As the traditional territory of the Algonquin people, a key route in the fur trade and the site of a 19th-century timber boom, the Ottawa River has played an important role in Canada’s history and economy. Its diverse ecosystems, which are currently the focus of several conservation efforts, are home to rich plant and animal life. The river also sustains urban areas along its shores, the largest being the Ottawa-Gatineau area.

AN  - 2282254383
AB  - Despite the increasing number of invasive species, protocols devoted to assess the feasibility (i.e., probability of success or failure) of management actions in the field are scarce, yet success depends on a broad scope of issues beyond the biology of species and the ecosystem to be managed. In this paper we make a retrospective analysis of 90 actions and management proposals developed in Andalusia (southern Spain) in 2004 to 2018. Actions included 59 terrestrial and aquatic taxa. We identified items that in case of deficiency were responsible for either the rejection of action proposals (n = 44) or failure of implemented actions for which the goal was not achieved (n = 22). The most frequent deficiencies included the absence of funding during the necessary time to achieve the goals, the risk of reinvasion and an insufficient removal rate to achieve the specific objective. Based on the deficiencies found, we built a comprehensive, broad-scope compliance checklist to assist decision-makers to identify deficiencies before action. In addition, implemented actions for which the goal was achieved (n = 24) were used for validating the checklist. The checklist contains 40 items related to IAS features, administrative features, methodology effectiveness, efficiency and impacts of the action, and invaded ecosystem features. The checklist is valid across all taxa and habitats. The use of this checklist will help reduce the degree of arbitrariness and subjectivity of actions aimed at managing IAS, and a more efficient use of resources.

T1  - Use of a rapid roadside survey to detect potentially invasive plant species along the Garden Route, South Africa
AN  - 2182376837
AB  - Early detection of emerging or sleeper weeds and monitoring of alien plant invasions forms the foundation of effective invasive alien plant management. Using a rapid roadside survey technique, we aimed to (1) establish a baseline of alien plant distribution and abundance along roads in the Garden Route, South Africa, and (2) identify priority species (particularly sleeper weeds) and priority areas to inform appropriate management action. We surveyed along 530 km of roads and recorded 109 alien and/or extralimital species across 1942 point locations. Of these, 35 species were considered to be sleeper weeds on account of displaying estimated dispersal distances distinctive of invasive plants and not being listed by the  South African Plant Invaders Atlas  (SAPIA) or regulated by South African legislation. Roads along natural forest and fynbos vegetation (often within the Garden Route National Park) displayed lower incidences of alien plants than those associated with degraded or transformed land, with roads along farmland associated with the highest incidences of alien plants. Roads in the Southern Cape region had more species and higher densities of alien plants than roads in the Tsitsikamma region, and a few species were exclusive to either.
 Conservation implications  : Our inventory contributed significant new records and range extensions to SAPIA, while the identified sleeper weeds offered suggestions for species that may be considered for regulation under the  National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act  of South Africa. We furthermore provided information to facilitate (1) timely management of emerging invasive alien plants, (2) prioritisation of species and areas for management action, and (3) future monitoring of alien plants in the Garden Route National Park and surrounds.

T1  - Subtidal Microphytobenthos: A Secret Garden Stimulated by the Engineer Species Crepidula fornicata
AN  - 2308097035
AB  - The slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata is an emblematic invasive species along the northeast Atlantic coast. This gregarious gastropod lives in stacks of several individuals and forms extended beds in shallow subtidal areas. The effects of this engineer species on the colonized habitat can be physical (e.g., presence of hard-shell substrates with uneven topography) or biological (e.g., nutrient enrichment by direct excretion or via biodeposition). We hypothesized that through biological activity, nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface are enhanced, leading to stimulated primary productivity by microphytobenthos (MPB) associated with Crepidula beds. To test this fertilization hypothesis, we conducted a 10-day mesocosm experiment using C. fornicata (live and dead) placed on top of sieved and homogenized sediment collected in situ. We used hyperspectral imaging to non-invasively map the development of MPB biomass, and to assess the potential influence of C. fornicata and its spatial extent. Our results showed that live C. fornicata significantly promote MPB growth through both physical and biological effects, with the biological effect dominating over the pure physical one. The highest stimulation was observed on the shells, suggesting that dissolved metabolic products excreted by C. fornicata were likely the main factor stimulating MPB growth in our short-term experiment. Our findings provide first direct evidence that stimulation of MPB growth by the biological activity of larger benthic epifauna occurs not only in intertidal but also in shallow subtidal habitats. More research is needed to assess the contribution of this fertilization effect to the trophic functioning of subtidal benthic systems.

T1  - Drivers of Cyanobacterial Blooms in a Hypertrophic Lagoon
AN  - 2308088248
AB  - The Curonian Lagoon is Europe’s largest lagoon and one of the most seriously impacted by harmful blooms of cyanobacteria. Intensive studies over the past 20 years have allowed us to identify the major drivers determining the composition and spatial extent of hyperblooms in this system. We summarize and discuss the main outcomes of these studies and provide an updated, conceptual scheme of the multiple interactions between climatic and hydrologic factors, and their influence on internal and external processes that promote cyanobacterial blooms. Retrospective analysis of remote sensed images demonstrated the variability of blooms in terms of timing, extension and intensity, suggesting that they occur only under specific circumstances. Monthly analysis of nutrient loads and stoichiometry from the principal tributary (Nemunas River) revealed large interannual differences in the delivery of key elements, but summer months were always characterized by a strong N (and Si) limitation, that depresses diatoms and favors the dominance of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria blooms result in transient (night-time) hypoxia, which stimulates the release of iron-bound P, producing a positive feedback for blooms of N-fixing cyanobacteria. Other biotic factors, such as dreissenid mussels, chironomid larvae, cyprinids and large bird colonies, may also promote P recycling during summer, but their role as drivers of cyanobacteria blooms is understudied.

T1  - Cold as Ice: a novel eradication and control method for invasive Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea, using pelleted dry ice
AN  - 2285116759
AB  - Eradication and control measures for invasive aquatic organisms require innovative methods that maximise efficacy whilst minimising environmental damage. Such methods should also ideally utilise readily available materials and have a relatively straightforward field application. The Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774) is a high impact freshwater invader that can dominate macroinvertebrate communities and physically alter benthic habitats. Moreover, C. fluminea has shown a high degree of physiological and ecological plasticity, and has displayed a remarkable capacity for human-mediated passive dispersal. Globally, despite repeated efforts to mitigate spread and implement substantial population control measures, C. fluminea continues to invade and spread. Accordingly, effective population eradication and control measures are urgently required. Here, we examine the efficacy of commercially available dry ice (DI) pellets (i.e. solid CO2 pellets at −78 °C) to kill C. fluminea, when applied both directly (water absent) and indirectly (clams submerged). Experiment 1 revealed the ability of 9 mm DI pellets to induce substantial C. fluminea mortality, with a direct application of 300 g DI at 5 min exposure inducing 100% clam mortality. In experiments 2 and 3, DI pellets of 9 mm induced higher clam mortality than 3 mm pellets, DI slices and mixed DI pellet sizes (3 and 9 mm) at simulated clam densities of 1179 and 3930 individuals m-2, especially when clams were submerged. Experiments 4 and 5 showed that DI application was highly effective even with clams that were covered in gravel or mud, due to the freezing of their surrounding substrate. Accordingly, these results demonstrate that DI can potentially be used for effective, rapid response control and eradication of C. fluminea populations. Whilst promising, our laboratory results require scaling up to field application and examination of the effects of water current, substrate, increased water depth, and greater C. fluminea population densities.

T1  - Viewpoints of pedestrians with and without cognitive impairment on shared zones and zebra crossings
AN  - 2102374002
AB  - Background 
Shared zones are characterised by an absence of traditional markers that segregate the road and footpath. Negotiation of a shared zone relies on an individual’s ability to perceive, assess and respond to environmental cues. This ability may be impacted by impairments in cognitive processing, which may lead to individuals experiencing increased anxiety when negotiating a shared zone.
 Method 
Q method was used in order to identify and explore the viewpoints of pedestrians, with and without cognitive impairments as they pertain to shared zones.
 Results 
Two viewpoints were revealed. Viewpoint one was defined by “confident users” while viewpoint two was defined by users who “know what [they] are doing but drivers might not”.
 Discussion 
Overall, participants in the study would not avoid shared zones. Pedestrians with intellectual disability were, however, not well represented by either viewpoint, suggesting that shared zones may pose a potential barrier to participation for this group.

AN  - 2058577492
AB  - The golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) and Corbicula fluminea are considered well-established invasive species in the rivers of Brazil and South America. In addition to the environmental problems resulting from this invasion process, the economic issue, especially in hydroelectric dams, is very worrisome and has mobilized several types of studies on these invasive bivalves. The detection and identification of these organisms in their adult phase in the rivers is not a problem; however, the identification of bivalve larvae by usual morphological methods is difficult due to high similarity conserved in these stages. The use of PCR-RFLP has proven to be an efficient and agile molecular method that allowed the detection of different patterns in the agarose gel for the two bivalves tested. The gel pattern showed a 100 bp band for L. fortunei not detected for C. fluminea. Thus, it is possible to detect larvae of these species from water samples, which can be a powerful tool for environmental monitoring programs on aquatic invasive species.

T1  - Invasive Species and Human Health
AN  - 2297207170
AB  - Invasive alien plants and animals are known for their disruption of ecosystems and threat to biodiversity. This book highlights their major impact on human health. This includes not only direct effects through contact with the species via bites, wounds and disease, but also indirect effects caused by changes induced in ecosystems by invasive species, such as more water hyacinth increasing mosquito levels and thereby the potential for malaria. Covering a wide range of case studies from different taxa (animals and plants), and giving an overview of the diverse impacts of invasive species on health in developed and developing countries, the book is a significant contribution that will help in prioritizing approaches to controlling invasive species and mitigating their health effects. It covers invasive plants, marine species, spiders and other arachnids, ticks and dust mites, insects, mosquitos and other diptera, freshwater species (invertebrates and fishes), amphibians and reptiles, birds and mammals. Key Features Collects together the major health impacts for the first timeCovers animal and plant invasive species Examines issues in developed and developing countries The broad spectrum of the analyzed case studies will ensure the appeal of the book to a wide public, including researchers of biological invasions, doctors, policy-makers and managers, and students of invasive species in ecology, animal and plant biology and public health medicine.Giuseppe Mazza (Edited By) - Giuseppe took his PhD at the University of Florence, studying eco-ethology of alien species, in particular the red palm weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, investigating several aspects of this invasive species (e.g. antimicrobial activity, sexual behaviour). He worked also on several aspects of biodiversity and conservation since 2003. He participated in the last years to five international expeditions, two in Malaysia, one in Vietnam, one in Ecuador and one in Kenya for the monitoring of entomo-fauna and the study of alien species. He is collaborating with national and international researchers on alien species, especially on insects and their impacts. Giuseppe is author of 58 peer-reviewed publications (31 with IF).Elena Tricarico (Edited By) - Elena studied and took her Master and PhD on Ethology and Animal Ecology at the University of Florence, working mostly on aquatic invertebrates. Since as a Master student, she deals with the biological invasions problem, particularly in freshwater ecosystems, through different perspectives, from behavioural ecology to management aspects. Elena participated to several national and European projects (as DAISIE, IMPASSE) on alien species, and she recently started to work on the predictive aspects of this problem, especially in relation to the climate change. Her main fields of research range from biological invasions to social behaviour in invertebrates, leading her to travel around Europe, USA and Africa, to establish many fruitful collaborations and to produce 60 peer reviewed publications (42 with IF), 5 book chapters and 1 edited book.Currently, she is involved in the COST Action TD1209 (Alien Challenge). Elena was co-responsible for the revision of the freshwater species of the EASIN catalogue and she is on its editorial board.

T1  - Municipal struggles with invasive species
AN  - 2117802707
AB  - Invasive species are species that are not native to a particular area.

Because they are foreign to the local ecosystem, they can have significant negative impacts upon native species.

Penalties for contravening the Act are significant and include fines of up to $250,000 or one year in jail, or both, for a first offence.5 Ontario has also recently announced new investments and partnerships to combat invasive species, including: supporting the Invasive Species Centre's work to further research into biological control agents for phragmites and dogstringling vine; supporting the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters Invading Species Awareness Program (funding the Ontario Invasive Plant Council) to engage municipalities in the development of municipal invasive plant management strategies; and supporting the Federation of Ontario Cottagers' Associations and their work with lakefront property owners to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species.6 Municipal responses Municipalities are directly impacted by invasive species, once they become a problem.

The City of Burnaby, British Columbia has developed an extensive management plan for the Still Creek Watershed that incorporated the mapping of known invasive plant species, risk management, monitoring, and testing.9 Where invasive species have become a significant problem, some municipalities have turned to active control measures.

T1  - Connections and containers: Using genetic data to understand how watershed evolution and human activities influence cutthroat trout biogeography
AN  - 2086679141
AB  - Species with large geographic distributions often exhibit complex patterns of diversity that can be further complicated by human activities. Cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) are one of the most widely distributed freshwater fish species in western North America exhibiting substantial phenotypic and genetic variability; however, fish stocking practices have translocated populations outside of their native range and may have obscured intraspecific boundaries. This study focuses on cutthroat trout populations representing three distinct evolutionary clades that are found intermixed within a contact zone between the Bonneville and upper Snake River watersheds in the western United States. We used mitochondrial and microsatellite genetic data, as well as historical stocking records, to evaluate whether populations of cutthroat trout in the contact zone are native or are introduced. We found significant genetic differentiation and fine-scale genetic population structure that was organized primarily by watershed boundaries. While we detected increased genetic diversity in some areas in close proximity to the greatest number of stocking events, the highly organized population structure both within and between areas of the contact zone indicates that the populations are native to the watersheds. Intermixing of distinct evolutionary lineages of cutthroat trout appears to be the result of historical connections between paleodrainages. Our analyses provide a context for understanding how genetic data can be used to assess the status of populations as native or introduced.

T1  - Invasive Species and Human Health
AN  - 2148538599
AB  - Invasive alien plants and animals are known for their disruption of ecosystems and threat to biodiversity. This book highlights their major impact on human health. This includes not only direct effects through contact with the species via bites, wounds and disease, but also indirect effects caused by changes induced in ecosystems by invasive species, such as more water hyacinth increasing mosquito levels and thereby the potential for malaria. Covering a wide range of case studies from different taxa (animals and plants), and giving an overview of the diverse impacts of invasive species on health in developed and developing countries, the book is a significant contribution that will help in prioritizing approaches to controlling invasive species and mitigating their health effects. It covers invasive plants, marine species, spiders and other arachnids, ticks and dust mites, insects, mosquitos and other diptera, freshwater species (invertebrates and fishes), amphibians and reptiles, birds and mammals. Key Features Collects together the major health impacts for the first timeCovers animal and plant invasive speciesExamines issues in developed and developing countries The broad spectrum of the analyzed case studies will ensure the appeal of the book to a wide public, including researchers of biological invasions, doctors, policy-makers and managers, and students of invasive species in ecology, animal and plant biology and public health medicine.

AN  - 2173547849
AB  - [...]this species is one of the most successful invasive species in aquatic ecosystems (Crespo et al. 2015).

The rapid spread and the invasion success is related to its biological characteristics (rapid growth, early sexual maturity, high fecundity, hermaphroditism, planktonic larvae, and the potential to reach high population density levels), extensive dispersal capacities, its physiological tolerance and its association to human activity.

Only small patches of fine sediment are deposited at the inside of the meander bends, where the water velocity locally drops.

[...]fine sediment may be found after meander bends as well as at the bottom of the deeper sections.

Since we sampled only shallow and accessible sections of the Drava River, we do not know whether the Asian clam lives in the deeper sections as well.

T1  - A preliminary investigation into biosecurity treatments to manage the invasive killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus)
AN  - 2287044459
AB  - Following the detection of the invasive killer shrimp, Dikerogammarus villosus (Dv) at two sites in the UK in September 2010, an effective biosecurity system is required to prevent further spread. This study investigated the application of several treatments as potential biosecurity measures with a view to their application on Dv-infected fomites. For each treatment, adult Dv were submerged for 15 minutes at different concentrations to determine the maximum lethal concentration, and for each effective treatment for different times to assess a minimal lethal time (LT50). Sodium hypochlorite (50,000 mg/Lmg/L), FAM30® (6 ml/l), Virkon S® (1% solution) and water at high temperature (45 °C) were found to cause 100% mortality within 15-min exposure, while carbonated water caused narcosis in 100% of animals within a few seconds of exposure. Due to various drawbacks in the use of sodium hypochlorite, FAM30® and Virkon S® (e.g. health and safety, legal use) they were not recom¬mended as biosecurity treatments, whereas both water at high temperature and carbonated water showed promise. However, further investigation and field based research are required before these techniques can be fully realised as methods of control.

T1  - When phylogeny and ecology meet: Modeling the occurrence of Trichoptera with environmental and phylogenetic data
AN  - 2057171018
AB  - Ecological studies are increasingly considering phylogenetic relationships among species. The phylogeny is used as a proxy or filter to improve statistical tests and retain evolutionary elements, such as niche conservation. We used the phylogenetic topology to improve the model for occurrence of Trichoptera genera in Cerrado (Brazilian Savanna) streams. We tested whether parameters generated by logistic models of occurrence, using phylogenetic signals, are better than models generated without phylogenetic information. We used a model with Bayesian updating to examine the influence of stream water pH and phylogenetic relationship among genera on the occurrence of Trichoptera genera. Then, we compared this model with the logistic model for each Trichoptera genus. The probability of occurrence of most genera increased with water pH, and the phylogeny‐based explicit logistic model improved the parameters estimated for observed genera. The inferred relationship between genera occurrence and stream pH improved, indicating that phylogeny adds relevant information when estimating ecological responses of organisms. Water with elevated acidity (low pH values) may be restrictive for the occurrence of Trichoptera larvae, especially if the regional streams exhibit neutral to alkaline water, as is observed in the Cerrado region. Using phylogeny‐based modeling to predict species occurrence is a prominent opportunity to extend our current statistical framework based on environmental conditions, as it enables a more precise estimation of ecological parameters.

T1  - Effects of sampling effort on biodiversity patterns estimated from environmental DNA metabarcoding surveys
AN  - 2053310259
AB  - Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding can greatly enhance our understanding of global biodiversity and our ability to detect rare or cryptic species. However, sampling effort must be considered when interpreting results from these surveys. We explored how sampling effort influenced biodiversity patterns and nonindigenous species (NIS) detection in an eDNA metabarcoding survey of four commercial ports. Overall, we captured sequences from 18 metazoan phyla with minimal differences in taxonomic coverage between 18 S and COI primer sets. While community dissimilarity patterns were consistent across primers and sampling effort, richness patterns were not, suggesting that richness estimates are extremely sensitive to primer choice and sampling effort. The survey detected 64 potential NIS, with COI identifying more known NIS from port checklists but 18 S identifying more operational taxonomic units shared between three or more ports that represent un-recorded potential NIS. Overall, we conclude that eDNA metabarcoding surveys can reveal global similarity patterns among ports across a broad array of taxa and can also detect potential NIS in these key habitats. However, richness estimates and species assignments require caution. Based on results of this study, we make several recommendations for port eDNA sampling design and suggest several areas for future research.

T1  - Ichthyofauna of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant cooling pond (Enerhodar, Ukraine) and its biomeliorative significance
AN  - 2061498147
AB  - The article presents the results of comprehensive research of the fish fauna of the cooling pond of the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant. The species composition of the fish fauna and the main limiting factors affecting the structure of the ichthyocenosis of the reservoir have been studied. It is noted that the fish fauna is dominated by invasive species (57%), most of which are introduced for the biological melioration in a cooling pond. The decrease in the number of native fish species is caused both by the spread of invasive species and by the factor of high water temperature. The latter factor limits the number of fish species that do not tolerate a rise in water temperature (roach Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758), bream Abramis brama (Linnaeus, 1758), rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus, 1758)). The paper also presents the results of studies on the nutrition spectrum of fish living in the Zaporizhia NPP cooling pond. The dynamics of catches of the main ameliorative species over the last 10 years has been analyzed. Practical recommendations on the stocking the heat sink with ameliorative fish for the period of 2018-2022 are given.

T1  - Deterred but not preferred: Predation by native whelk Reishia clavigera on invasive bivalves
AN  - 2039840871
AB  - This study tested the potential bio-control role of the common native predatory whelk Reishia clavigera on the invasive bivalves Xenostrobus securis and Mytilopsis sallei and the native Brachidontes variabilis in Hong Kong. Predation experiments were conducted in the laboratory under salinity levels of 22‰ and 32‰, as well as under field conditions. The results indicate that the invasive bivalves are more vulnerable to predation than the native bivalve in environments with high salinity, whereas environments with moderately low salinity (22‰) may reduce predation. Because R. clavigera did not show clear prey preference, the low survival of the invasive species might be due to a lack of effective anti-predatory defenses under experimental conditions. These findings could explain the high abundance of the invasive bivalves in disturbed environments in Hong Kong where predation appears to be lower.

T1  - Expert Based Ecosystem Service Assessment in Coastal and Marine Planning and Management: A Baltic Lagoon Case Study
AN  - 2284164463
AB  - The assessment of ecosystem services, the benefits humans obtain from ecosystems, is a worldwide topic of growing interest, but examples addressing coastal and marine water are still a small minority. In this study, we carry out an expert based ecosystem service assessment for a concrete case study, the Szczecin (Oder) Lagoon located at the German/Polish border in the Baltic Sea region. We analyze to what extent, in which step and how it can be applied for supporting Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM), the ecological-social-economic assessment within System Approach Frameworks (SAF) and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). The large, shallow Szczecin Lagoon is heavily eutrophied. Therefore, several alternative measures (scenarios) are under discussion to improve its water quality and its ecological status. Scenarios include a large-scale mussel farm; the establishment of a local mussel farm that removes nutrients via harvest and increases water transparency; artificial mussel beds; groynes to reduce coastal current velocities, favor sediment accumulation, and promote the enlargement of macrophyte beds and other measures to enlarge macrophyte belts and coverage. We adapt and apply a computer aided ecosystem service assessment and visualization tool (ESAT). Eight experts and two student groups apply this tool and carry out an assessment of each scenario compared to the present state of the lagoon. The results show that the scenario assuming measures to enlarge macrophyte belts is perceived as the one that generates the highest additional ecosystem service output. However, more importantly our approach can serve as tool to catch the views of experts, can extract disagreements between experts and misunderstandings in the setup of scenarios as well as services that have highest priority for further consideration. Further, the results are useful for preparing stakeholder discussions and workshops. However, the expert assessments are influenced by the spatial scale of the assessed scenarios. As consequence, the assessment results itself cannot be regarded as a reliable basis for decision making. Today, Integrated Coastal Zone Management ideas and approaches are well reflected and integrated into Marine Spatial Planning and we show that a comparative ecosystem service assessment can be applied in different steps of each concept.

T1  - Invasion of Finnish inland waters by the alien moss animal Pectinatella magnifica Leidy, 1851 and associated potential risks
AN  - 2287075415
AB  - Introduced alien species bring potential adverse impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functions. International shipping is an important vector for such unintentional introductions in aquatic environments. Therefore, in addition to climate change and eutrophication, increasing international shipping may enhance the spread of alien species into areas which have not previously been considered prone to alien invasions. One example of such development might be the recent invasion of the moss animal Pectinatella magnifica into Finnish inland waters, which are generally considered to be hostile to alien species. We took advantage of observations made by the general public and recorded by environmental authorities to describe the invasion history of the species in Finland. The records of P. magnifica were almost exclusively from the Vuoksi watercourse, where the species was most likely introduced by international shipping ca 10–15 years ago. The species occurred mainly in the vicinity of ports of international shipping, but was also abundant in an area with only domestic cargo transport. Only one confirmed observation in Lake Kirkkojärvi was from outside the Vuoksi watercourse. Most colonies were found attached to landing stages or submerged, relatively rigid water plants, and the species seemed to avoid less rigid water plants, such as water lilies. Once established, the species may spread by vectors such as recreational boating or water birds and fish. The species poses some risks to the ecosystem, including a risk to farmed and wild salmonid fish by serving as a potential host for the myxozoan endoparasite Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, the causative agent for proliferative kidney disease (PKD), known to be detrimental for salmonid fish.

T1  - Repurposing environmental DNA samples—detecting the western pearlshell ( Margaritifera falcata ) as a proof of concept
AN  - 2010609505
AB  - Information on the distribution of multiple species in a common landscape is fundamental to effective conservation and management. However, distribution data are expensive to obtain and often limited to high‐profile species in a system. A recently developed technique, environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling, has been shown to be more sensitive than traditional detection methods for many aquatic species. A second and perhaps underappreciated benefit of eDNA sampling is that a sample originally collected to determine the presence of one species can be re‐analyzed to detect additional taxa without additional field effort. We developed an eDNA assay for the western pearlshell mussel (Margaritifera falcata) and evaluated its effectiveness by analyzing previously collected eDNA samples that were annotated with information including sample location and deposited in a central repository. The eDNA samples were initially collected to determine habitat occupancy by nonbenthic fish species at sites that were in the vicinity of locations recently occupied by western pearlshell. These repurposed eDNA samples produced results congruent with historical western pearlshell surveys and permitted a more precise delineation of the extent of local populations. That a sampling protocol designed to detect fish was also successful for detecting a freshwater mussel suggests that rapidly accumulating collections of eDNA samples can be repurposed to enhance the efficiency and cost‐effectiveness of aquatic biodiversity monitoring.

T1  - Modulators of mercury risk to wildlife and humans in the context of rapid global change
AN  - 1993603837
AB  - Environmental mercury (Hg) contamination is an urgent global health threat. The complexity of Hg in the environment can hinder accurate determination of ecological and human health risks, particularly within the context of the rapid global changes that are altering many ecological processes, socioeconomic patterns, and other factors like infectious disease incidence, which can affect Hg exposures and health outcomes. However, the success of global Hg-reduction efforts depends on accurate assessments of their effectiveness in reducing health risks. In this paper, we examine the role that key extrinsic and intrinsic drivers play on several aspects of Hg risk to humans and organisms in the environment. We do so within three key domains of ecological and human health risk. First, we examine how extrinsic global change drivers influence pathways of Hg bioaccumulation and biomagnification through food webs. Next, we describe how extrinsic socioeconomic drivers at a global scale, and intrinsic individual-level drivers, influence human Hg exposure. Finally, we address how the adverse health effects of Hg in humans and wildlife are modulated by a range of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers within the context of rapid global change. Incorporating components of these three domains into research and monitoring will facilitate a more holistic understanding of how ecological and societal drivers interact to influence Hg health risks.

T1  - Influences on Water Quality and Abundance of Cladophora, a Shore-Fouling Green Algae, over Urban Shoreline in Lake Ontario
AN  - 2582929989
AB  - Urban centers border western Lake Ontario, the terminus of the Laurentian Great Lakes, impacting water quality on the shores of this oligotrophic lake. The green algae Cladophora proliferates on the shallow lakebed and fouls the shoreline, presenting an eutrophication concern. The conditions over a typical urbanized shoreline were studied to assess linkages between Cladophora and area nutrient sources. The most pervasive of the mixing areas of varying extent identified using field sensor measurements was associated with the discharge of treated sewage from a Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). Phosphorus and nitrogen were enriched at times near the WPCP diffuser and also in shallow water along the shoreline. Dissolved nutrients were also measured directly above the lakebed in close proximity to Cladophora. Dissolved phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen were higher in proximity to the WPCP diffuser at times, however, spatial patterns were not as clearly aligned with external inputs as the patterns of enrichment in the water column. Biomass distribution of Cladophora was unrelated to nutrient levels in the water column or at the lakebed. Yet, concentrations of phosphorus in Cladophora, an indicator of nutrient sufficiency, were higher near the WPCP diffuser. This disparity, while possibly an artifact of variable loss rates of biomass among locations, may in part stem from variable water clarity among areas. Abundant dreissenid mussels also potentially obscure the effects of nutrient loading on algal biomass if the sequestering of phosphorus from offshore plankton, suggested by periods of onshore circulation, approaches the extent of external loading. Further study of phosphorus flux at the lakebed is required to establish clear linkages between external nutrient loading and algal growth in order to manage the proliferation of Cladophora over urban coastline.

T1  - Drop in the Ocean: Molecular Approaches for Exploring the Diversity and Distribution of the Ascetosporea
AN  - 2411909139
AB  - The protistan class Ascetosporea (Rhizaria, Endomyxa) comprises five orders of parasites of aquatic invertebrates: Haplosporida, Paramyxida, Mikrocytida, Paradinida and Claustrosporida. The group includes a number of species known for their devastating effects as pathogens of economically significant bivalve species, the most notorious of which are the oyster pathogens Marteilia refringens (Paramyxida), Bonamia ostreae (Haplosporida) and Mikrocytos mackini (Mikrocytida). Due to its significance to aquaculture, interest in the group is growing, and a number of recent environmental DNA (eDNA)-based studies indicate vast, uncharacterised diversity within the class.Traditionally species discovery and description has relied on microscopy studies of infected invertebrate tissue, and as such our understanding of the group is biased towards pathogens of commercially exploited or easily studied invertebrates, with comparatively little known about the diversity of Ascetosporea outside such hosts. Many species, particularly those infecting less “important” hosts, have not been molecularly characterised, hindering phylogenetic studies and limiting our understanding of the relationship between morphology and phylogeny.This study uses primer-based screens of a wide range of environmental and invertebrate-associated samples to explore the diversity, distribution and host range of the four best-known ascetosporean orders, and in doing so links sequence data to described species, and allows the molecular and morphological characterisation of novel haplosporidian species in bivalve hosts.PCR screens also uncovered a large radiation of novel sequence types within Paradinida, in littoral and coastal environmental samples, and demonstrated the abundance and diversity of haplosporidians in freshwater and terrestrial sample types.This study also focuses on the development and application of sensitive complementary molecular and microscopy-based methods for the detection of parasite life-stages in host tissues, and consideration given to the role of molecular methods in facilitating rapid, accurate diagnosis of pathogens in important hosts.

T1  - Integrative Approaches for Conservation Management of Critically Endangered Nassau Grouper (Epinephelus Striatus) in the Bahamas
AN  - 2230898687
AB  - Species conservation is typically founded upon a range of management strategies, which integrate both biological and socioeconomic data. In this thesis, population genetics, acoustic telemetry, spawning aggregation surveys and stakeholder assessments were used to address key knowledge gaps limiting effective conservation management for critically endangered Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) stocks in The Bahamas. A panel of polymorphic microsatellite markers was optimised to assess the genetic population dynamics of more than 400 Nassau grouper sampled throughout the country. Microsatellite data indicate that contemporary Nassau grouper populations in The Bahamas are predominantly genetically diverse and weakly differentiated, but lack geographic population structure. Assessments of changes in effective population size (Ne) show substantive reductions in Ne within The Bahamas compared to historic values that are likely due to natural disturbances. Evidence for recent bottlenecks occurring in three islands as well as an active spawning site, along with higher inbreeding coefficients in two islands were also found, and can be attributed to more recent anthropogenic activities. Collapse of a historically important Nassau grouper fish spawning aggregation (FSA) was supported by both acoustic telemetry and spawning aggregation survey dives. Restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) of 94 Nassau grouper was used to explore intraspecific population dynamics, loci under selection and patterns of gene flow in The Bahamas. Genomic assessments of diversity were in accord with microsatellite data and examinations of gene flow support higher levels of connectivity in The Bahamas than was previously suggested. The increased resolution gained from assessments of genomic data support intraspecific population structuring that may be driven by differences in gene flow and putative loci under divergent selection. Telemetry data were successfully used to identify the origins of spawning adults, and support demographic connectivity through migrations between an active FSA in the central Bahamas and home reef habitats within the Exumas and a no-take marine protected area. Stakeholder assessments highlight the complexities of fisheries management within The Bahamas, with key stakeholders often exhibiting conflicting opinions regarding the status of Nassau grouper and the efficacy of  management options. However, these groups mutually agree upon the need to better manage remaining Nassau grouper stocks within The Bahamas through science-grounded policies. Synthesis of these studies along with a review of fisheries governance in The Bahamas was used to develop a comprehensive national management plan for Nassau grouper to facilitate better conservation for remaining populations of this ecologically important marine species.

T1  - A review of regulation ecosystem services and disservices from faunal populations and potential impacts of agriculturalisation on their provision, globally
AN  - 2162781694
AB  - Land use and cover change (LUCC) is the main cause of natural ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss and can cause a decrease in ecosystem service provision. Animal populations are providers of some key regulation services: pollination, pest and disease control and seed dispersal, the so-called faunal ecosystem services (FES). Here we aim to give an overview on the current and future status of regulation FES in response to change from original habitat to agricultural land globally. FES are much more tightly linked to wildlife populations and biodiversity than are most ecosystem services, whose determinants are largely climatic and related to vegetation structure. Degradation of ecosystems by land use change thus has much more potential to affect FES. In this scoping review, we summarise the main findings showing the importance of animal populations as FES providers and as a source of ecosystem disservices; underlying causes of agriculturalisation impacts on FES and the potential condition of FES under future LUCC in relation to the expected demand for FES globally. Overall, studies support a positive relationship between FES provision and animal species richness and abundance. Agriculturalisation has negative effects on FES providers due to landscape homogenisation, habitat fragmentation and loss, microclimatic changes and development of population imbalance, causing species and population losses of key fauna, reducing services whilst enhancing disservices. Since evidence suggests an increase in FES demand worldwide is required to support increased farming, it is imperative to improve the understanding of agriculturalisation on FES supply and distribution. Spatial conservation prioritisation must factor in faunal ecosystem functions as the most biodiversity-relevant of all ecosystem services and that which most closely links sites of service provision of conservation value with nearby sites of service use to provide ecosystem services of agricultural and economic value.

T1  - Calendar and thermal time-based growth models for common carp and pikeperch, and the influence of stocking strategy in Lake Balaton, Hungary
AN  - 2161919855
AB  - Common carp Cyprinus carpio and pikeperch Sander lucioperca are widely distributed and economically important freshwater fishes. Because these species are extensively stocked both within and outside of their native ranges, it is important to assess the effect of these actions. We aimed to analyse growth rate and its variability related to stocking strategy (season × lake area × habitat × fish size) in common carp and pikeperch in Lake Balaton (Hungary), based on cooperative tagging experiments with anglers. In both species, length increment was more closely associated with thermal time (degree-day sum) over 8 °C threshold water temperature than calendar time. Except a marked decrease with increasing fish size, stocking parameters had little effect on length increment. Growth models based on the GROTAG method and the von Bertalanffy's asymptotic length (L∞) and growth rate (K) are provided. Compared to other habitats, estimated growth rate proved to be high in common carp (128 mm year−1 at 300 mm standard length) and modest in pikeperch (61 mm year−1 at 250 mm standard length). We concluded that stocking rate even might be increased in common carp, while management of the pikeperch population should rather be based on catch restriction measures than intensified stockings.
La carpe commune Cyprinus carpio et le sandre Sander lucioperca sont des poissons d'eau douce largement distribués et économiquement importants. Étant donné que ces espèces sont largement déversées à l'intérieur et à l'extérieur de leur aire de répartition naturelle, il est important d'évaluer l'effet de ces actions. Nous avons cherché à analyser le taux de croissance et sa variabilité liés à la stratégie d'empoissonnement (saison × superficie du lac × habitat × taille du poisson) chez la carpe commune et le sandre du lac Balaton (Hongrie), sur la base d'expériences de marquage en coopération avec les pêcheurs à la ligne. Chez les deux espèces, l'incrément de longueur était plus étroitement associé au temps thermique (somme des degrés-jours) au-dessus seuil de 8 °C pour la température de l'eau que le temps calendaire. Sauf une diminution marquée avec l'augmentation de la taille des poissons, les paramètres d'empoissonnement ont eu peu d'effet sur l'augmentation de la longueur. Des modèles de croissance basés sur la méthode GROTAG, et la longueur asymptotique de von Bertalanffy (L∞) et le taux de croissance (K) sont fournis. Par rapport à d'autres habitats, le taux de croissance estimé s'est avéré élevé chez la carpe commune (128 mm année−1 à 300 mm de longueur standard) et modeste chez le sandre (61 mm année−1 à 250 mm de longueur standard). Nous avons conclu que le taux d'empoissonnement pourrait même être augmenté chez la carpe commune, alors que la gestion de la population de sandre devrait plutôt être basée sur des mesures de restriction des prises que sur des empoissonnements intensifiés.

T1  - Evaluating the Effects of Temperature on the Metabolic Rates of Two Sedentary Marine Fishes, the Bluebanded Goby, and the Woolly Sculpin
AN  - 2092265383
AB  - Increasing variation in ocean temperature may affect the metabolism and energetic demands of many species. Understanding such effects is particularly important for sedentary species that cannot make large-scale movements in response to changes in environmental conditions. I examined how metabolic rates responded to temperature in the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli) and the Woolly Sculpin (Clinocottus analis). Oxygen consumption and metabolic rate increased significantly with temperature for both species, but L. dalli was much more sensitive to the effects of temperature than C. analis (Q 10 values were 5.21 and 3.02, respectively). Thermal fluctuations likely play a significant role in the ecology of these species and continued increases in seawater temperature will either necessitate an increase in foraging and food consumption or drive costly trade-offs between metabolism and processes such as growth and reproduction.

T1  - Conservation Canines in Canada: Roles, Welfare & Environmental Impacts
AN  - 2087630574
AB  - People have been employing dogs to assist with conservation work for more than a century. While the literature documents the efficacy of using dogs in these roles, the welfare and experiences of these dogs has received little attention. I explored the lives of conservation canines in Canada through two case studies. My aim was to explore the roles, welfare, and environmental impacts of conservation canines in Alberta and Ontario in order to determine whether conservation canine programs offer humane and sustainable job opportunities – those that are good for animals, humans, and the environment. I employed qualitative research methods via interviews with canine handlers and participant observations, as well as quantitative methods to assess animal welfare using an ethogram. My findings suggest that conservation roles are good for dogs because dogs showed signs of enjoyment and little stress while working, and handlers primarily used reward-based training as opposed to punishment; however, aversive stimuli are used at times, thus welfare may be at risk in some cases. These roles are also good for people as handlers seemed proud of their work and showed strong connections with their canines. Finally, they are good for the environment as they help educate the public about conservation issues, such as invasive species, and deter natural resources-related crimes, such as poaching. This assessment is based on three major frameworks: animal studies, animal welfare, and sustainability. Based on my findings, I recommend implementing more rigid guidelines for the care of working dogs in order to ensure their long-term welfare in situations where welfare might be impaired. Future research should further investigate the handlers’ experiences and environmental impacts of this work and include physiological indicators of welfare. Other case studies should also be explored in order to provide a more complete representation of conservation canine programs and the extent to which they might be humane and sustainable.

T1  - Fine-scale genetic structure of the European bitterling at the intersection of three major European watersheds
AN  - 2071426194
AB  - Background 
Anthropogenic factors can have a major impact on the contemporary distribution of intraspecific genetic diversity. Many freshwater fishes have finely structured and locally adapted populations, but their natural genetic structure can be affected by river engineering schemes across river basins, fish transfers in aquaculture industry and conservation management. The European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus) is a small fish that is a brood parasite of freshwater mussels and is widespread across continental Europe. Its range recently expanded, following sharp declines in the 1970s and 1980s. We investigated its genetic variability and spatial structure at the centre of its distribution at the boundary of three watersheds, testing the role of natural and anthropogenic factors in its genetic structure.
 Results 
Sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome B (CYTB) revealed that bitterling colonised central Europe from two Ponto-Caspian refugia, which partly defines its contemporary genetic structure. Twelve polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed pronounced interpopulation differentiation, with significant small-scale differentiation within the same river basins. At a large scale, populations from the Baltic Sea watershed (middle Oder and Vistula basins) were distinct from those from the Black Sea watershed (Danube basin), while populations from rivers of the North Sea watershed (Rhine, Elbe) originated from the admixture of both original sources. Notable exceptions demonstrated the potential role of human translocations across watersheds, with the upper River Oder (Baltic watershed) inhabited by fish from the Danube basin (Black Sea watershed) and a population in the southern part of the River Elbe (North Sea watershed) basin possessing a signal of admixture from the Danube basin.
 Conclusions 
Hydrography and physical barriers to dispersal are only partly reflected in the genetic structure of the European bitterling at the intersection of three major watersheds in central Europe. Drainage boundaries have been obscured by human-mediated translocations, likely related to common carp, Cyprinus carpio, cultivation and game-fish management. Despite these translocations, populations of bitterling are significantly structured by genetic drift, possibly reinforced by its low dispersal ability. Overall, the impact of anthropogenic factors on the genetic structure of the bitterling populations in central Europe is limited.

T1  - Thermal tolerance for two cohorts of a native and an invasive freshwater turtle species
AN  - 2067959586
AB  - The ability to tolerate environmental stress may determine invasion success of alien species. Comparative data on physiological thermal tolerance between native and invasive vertebrates are quite limited. Here, we assessed the difference in thermal tolerance between a native (Mauremys reevesii) and an invasive (Trachemys scripta elegans) freshwater turtle species. We incubated eggs of M. reevesii and T. scripta elegans from different cohorts at 29 °C, and measured the critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax) of hatchlings. Our results preliminarily showed that the hatchlings of T. scripta elegans had a greater high-temperature tolerance and wider tolerance range than the hatchlings of M. reevesii; in the two-cohort system, individuals from the high-latitude cohort seemed to have greater low-temperature tolerance but similar high-temperature tolerance compared with those from the low-latitude cohort. Relatively greater thermal tolerance ability for T scripta elegans might reflect its environmental adaptability to thermal stress.

T1  - CAN THE INVASIVE NEW ZEALAND MUD SNAIL (POTAMOPYRGUS ANTIPODARUM) THREATEN FISHERIES OF TEMPERATE LAKES? A CASE STUDY FROM LAKE DUSIA, LITHUANIA
AN  - 2052766385
AB  - To date, numerous studies of the impact of snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843) on invaded ecosystems have been conducted. However, the majority of such studies intended to assess changes induced in macroinvertebrate assemblages, while the possible effects of P. antipodarum on higher trophic levels have not hitherto been studied. Of particular interest from the point of view of fisheries management is the elucidation of how this invasive snail can alter the energy flow towards higher trophic levels. When abundant, P. antipodarum consumes a substantial part of the primary production, but it is poorly consumed by native fishes. Consequently, part of its assimilated energy may become locked in lower trophic levels and fail to reach higher levels directly. Therefore, invasion of this snail may decrease fish production. Several years after establishment of P. antipodarum in a temperate mesotrophic Lake Dusia, we assessed: (1) changes in the biomass of littoral macroinvertebrates (proxy to secondary production), (2) assimilation of P. antipodarum by benthivorous fish (energy flow), and (3) changes in growth and catches of littoral benthivorous fish (fish production). All the analyses were based on a merger of "grey" literature and original data during the pre- and post-invasion periods. There was an evident increase in the biomass of littoral macroinvertebrates, and the assemblage changed from crustacean- to gastropod-dominated due to over-domination of P. antipodarum. However, P. antipodarum did not replace the native prey of fish. Moreover, a marked decrease was recorded in littoral fish growth and catches after the invasion of P. antipodarum. Dense populations of P. antipodarum may reduce the channelling of primary production towards higher trophic levels and, consequently, the invasion may threaten fisheries of temperate mesotrophic lakes.

T1  - Mechanical Inference in Dynamic Ecosystems
AN  - 2048298157
AB  - Empirical studies of graphs have contributed enormously to our understanding of complex systems, growing into a more scientific exploration of communities spanning the physical, biological, and social called network science. As the quantity and types of networks have grown so has their heterogeneity in quality and specificity resulting in a wealth of datasets that are not matched by existing theoretical methods. This is especially true in ecology where the majority of interactions are indirect and unobservable even in well-studied systems. As a result ecologists continue to grapple with three fundamental questions: Most basically, (i) `How do ecosystems function?' I answered this question by comparing networks to each other such that poorly-studied systems can be understood through their similarity to well-understood ones and theoretical models. To do this I created the alignment algorithm netcom which recasts ecosystem processes as statistical dynamics of diffusion kernels originating from a network's constituent nodes. Using netcom I constructed a supervised classifier which can distinguish processes in both synthetic and empirical network data. While this kind of inference works on currently available network data, I have shown how causality can serve as a more effective and unifying currency of ecological interaction. Measures of causality are even able to identify complex interactions across organizational scales of communities, answering the longstanding question (ii) `Can community structure causally determine dynamics of constituent species?' Moreover, causal inference can be readily combined with existing modeling frameworks to quantify dynamic interactions at the same scale as the underlying data. In this way we can answer the question (iii) `Which species in an ecosystem cause which other species?' These tools are part of a paradigm shift in ecology that offers the potential to make more reliable management decisions for dynamic ecosystems in real time using only observational data.

T1  - Polychaetes of Greece: an updated and annotated checklist
AN  - 2282184445
AB  - This checklist comprises an updated and annotated inventory of polychaete species in Greek waters, compiled from literature reports, online databases, museum collections and unpublished datasets. The list provides information on 836 species-level taxa from Greece, of which 142 are considered questionable. An additional 84 species reported in the past are currently considered absent from Greece; reasons for the exclusion of each species are given. Fourteen species are reported here for the first time from Greek waters. At least 52 species in the present list constitute in fact a complex of cryptic or pseudo-cryptic species. Forty-seven species are considered non-native to the area. In addition to the species-level taxa reported in this checklist, eleven genera have been recorded from Greece with no representatives identified to species level. One replacement name is introduced. For each species, a comprehensive bibliographic list of occurrence records in Greece and the synonyms used in these publications are provided as supplementary material. Where necessary, the taxonomic, nomenclatural or biogeographic status is discussed. Finally, the findings are discussed in the wider context of Mediterranean polychaete biogeography, taxonomic practice and worldwide research progress.

T1  - First evidence of bighead carp wild recruitment in Western Europe, and its relation to hydrology and temperature
AN  - 1976000639
AB  - Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) have been introduced throughout Europe, mostly unintentionally, and little attention has been given to their potential for natural reproduction. We investigated the presence of young-of-the-year bighead carp in an irrigation canal network of Northern Italy and the environmental conditions associated with spawning in 2011–2015. The adult bighead carp population of the canal network was composed by large, likely mature, individuals with an average density of 45.2 kg/ha (over 10 fold more than in the main river). The 29 juvenile bighead carp found were 7.4–13.1 cm long (TL) and weighed 9.5–12.7 g. Using otolith-derived spawning dates we estimated that these juveniles were 94–100 days old, placing their fertilization and hatch dates in mid-to-end-June. Using this information in combination with thermal and hydraulic data, we examined the validity of existing models predicting the onset of spawning conditions and the viability of egg pathways to elucidate spawning location of the species. While evidence of reproduction was not found every year, we determined that potentially viable spawning conditions (annual degree-days and temperature thresholds) and pathways of egg drift suitable for hatching are present in short, slow-flowing canals.

T1  - Using dissolved carbon dioxide to alter the behavior of invasive round goby
AN  - 2287041990
AB  - Fisheries managers need effective methods to limit the spread of invasive round goby Neogobius melanostomus in North America. Elevating carbon dioxide (CO2) in water at pinch points of rivers (e.g., inside locks) is one approach showing potential to deter the passage of invasive fishes, such as bigheaded carps Hypophthalmichthys spp., but the effectiveness of this method to alter round goby behavior has not been determined. The goal for this study was to determine CO2 concentrations that alter round goby behavior across a range of water temperatures. Free-swimming avoidance (voluntary response) and loss of equilibrium (involuntary response) were quantified by exposing round goby to increasing CO2 concentrations at 5, 15, and 25 °C using a shuttle box choice arena and static tank. Water chemistry was measured concurrent with behavioral endpoints and showed that round goby avoided a threshold of 99–169 mg/L CO2 (79,000–178,000 µatm) and lost equilibrium at 197–280 mg/L CO2 (163,000–303,000 µatm). Approximately 50% lower CO2 concentrations were found to modify behavior at 5 °C relative to 25 °C, suggesting greater effectiveness at lower water temperatures. We conclude that CO2 modified round goby behavior and concentrations determined in this study are intended to guide field testing of CO2 as an invasive fish deterrent.

T1  - eDNA for detection of five highly invasive molluscs. A case study in urban rivers from the Iberian Peninsula
AN  - 1964559123
AB  - Biological invasions are an important threat to biodiversity especially in aquatic ecosystems, and their frequency is generally higher near urban areas. Potentially invasive non-indigenous molluscs were deliberately introduced into European waters for food (Corbicula fluminea) and biocontrol (Melanoides tuberculata), and unintentionally introduced by ballast water (Mytilopsis leucophaeata, Corbicula fluminea), stock contamination (Sinanodonta woodiana), accidental escapes from aquaculture (Sinanodonta woodiana), aquarium trade releases (Melanoides tuberculata) and even attached to aquatic birds (Corbicula fluminea). Three rivers from the Iberian Peninsula were monitored near the three most populated inland cities to evaluate the presence of these invasive molluscs through PCR amplification using taxon-specific primers from eDNA. New primers were designed within 16S rRNA and cytochrome oxidase subunit I genes, tested in silico from BLAST methodology and experimentally in vitro before application in the field. C. fluminea was found in Ebro River (near Zaragoza); M. leucophaeata in Guadalquivir River (near Sevilla). M. tuberculata and S. woodiana were found from enclosed areas (lake and reservoir respectively) upstream, respectively, Zaragoza and Madrid. The new tools are ready to be used in other regions where these species are also invasive.

T1  - Gonadal cycle of Corbicula fluminea (Bivalvia: Corbiculidae) in Pampean streams (Southern Neotropical Region)
AN  - 1955028249
AB  - Corbicula fluminea is an aggressive invasive species of bivalve that arrived into the Río de la Plata River between the late 60’s and early 70’s, and dispersed widely throughout the Neotropical region, evidencing a great adaptive flexibility to different environmental conditions. This species is a functional hermaphrodite with larval incubation inside the inner demibranch. Despite its widespread distribution, there are no previous studies of complete gonadal histology and reproductive cycle for this species in the Neotropical region. In this study, the reproductive dynamics of C. fluminea in a temperate region, the Santa Catalina Pampean stream, Argentina, is described. Samples of 20–30 individuals were collected monthly from April 2003-April 2005 and processed using traditional histological techniques. During the two years of this study, seven spawning events were recognized. Three major spawns occurred in spring and summer, and other four minor ones during summer and autumn. Events of oocyte recovery were observed after spawning. A high number of incubating individuals was detected. The results stressed the difficulty of identifying a particular pattern of gamete release and of spawning behaviour in this invasive species, especially when inhabiting an unstable environment.

T1  - Ecosystem approach to fisheries: Exploring environmental and trophic effects on Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) reference point estimates
AN  - 1944248633
AB  - We present a comprehensive analysis of estimation of fisheries Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) reference points using an ecosystem model built for Mille Lacs Lake, the second largest lake within Minnesota, USA. Data from single-species modelling output, extensive annual sampling for species abundances, annual catch-survey, stomach-content analysis for predatory-prey interactions, and expert opinions were brought together within the framework of an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) ecosystem model. An increase in the lake water temperature was observed in the last few decades; therefore, we also incorporated a temperature forcing function in the EwE model to capture the influences of changing temperature on the species composition and food web. The EwE model was fitted to abundance and catch time-series for the period 1985 to 2006. Using the ecosystem model, we estimated reference points for most of the fished species in the lake at single-species as well as ecosystem levels with and without considering the influence of temperature change; therefore, our analysis investigated the trophic and temperature effects on the reference points. The paper concludes that reference points such as MSY are not stationary, but change when (1) environmental conditions alter species productivity and (2) fishing on predators alters the compensatory response of their prey. Thus, it is necessary for the management to re-estimate or re-evaluate the reference points when changes in environmental conditions and/or major shifts in species abundance or community structure are observed.

T1  - DNA in a bottle—Rapid metabarcoding survey for early alerts of invasive species in ports
AN  - 1935804449
AB  - Biota monitoring in ports is increasingly needed for biosecurity reasons and safeguarding marine biodiversity from biological invasion. Present and future international biosecurity directives can be accomplished only if the biota acquired by maritime traffic in ports is controlled. Methodologies for biota inventory are diverse and now rely principally on extensive and labor-intensive sampling along with taxonomic identification by experts. In this study, we employed an extremely simplified environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling methodology from only three 1-L bottles of water per port, followed by metabarcoding (high-throughput sequencing and DNA-based species identification) using 18S rDNA and Cytochrome oxidase I as genetic barcodes. Eight Bay of Biscay ports with available inventory of fouling invertebrates were employed as a case study. Despite minimal sampling efforts, three invasive invertebrates were detected: the barnacle Austrominius modestus, the tubeworm Ficopomatus enigmaticus and the polychaete Polydora triglanda. The same species have been previously found from visual and DNA barcoding (genetic identification of individuals) surveys in the same ports. The current costs of visual surveys, conventional DNA barcoding and this simplified metabarcoding protocol were compared. The results encourage the use of metabarcoding for early biosecurity alerts.

T1  - Ducks change wintering patterns due to changing climate in the important wintering waters of the Odra River Estuary
AN  - 1952530306
AB  - Some species of birds react to climate change by reducing the distance they travel during migration. The Odra River Estuary in the Baltic Sea is important for wintering waterfowl and is where we investigated how waterbirds respond to freezing surface waters. The most abundant birds here comprise two ecological groups: bottom-feeders and piscivores. Numbers of all bottom-feeders, but not piscivores, were negatively correlated with the presence of ice. With ongoing global warming, this area is increasing in importance for bottom-feeders and decreasing for piscivores. The maximum range of ice cover in the Baltic Sea has a weak and negative effect on both groups of birds. Five of the seven target species are bottom-feeders (Greater Scaup Aythya marila, Tufted Duck A. fuligula, Common Pochard A. ferina, Common Goldeneye Bucephala clangula and Eurasian Coot Fulica atra), and two are piscivores (Smew Mergellus albellus and Goosander Mergus merganser). Local changes at the level of particular species vary for different reasons. A local decline of the Common Pochard may simply be a consequence of its global decline. Climate change is responsible for some of the local changes in the study area, disproportionately favoring some duck species while being detrimental to others.

T1  - Phylogeography in Nassarius mud snails: Complex patterns in congeneric species
AN  - 1919516929
AB  - One major goal for phylogeographical studies is to elucidate respective roles of multiple evolutionary and ecological forces that shape the current distribution patterns. In marine and coastal ecosystems, it has been generated a common realization that species with enormous population size and pelagic larval stages can disperse across broad geographical scales, leading to weak or even no phylogeographical structure across large geographical scales. However, the violation of such realization has been frequently reported, and it remains largely unexplored on mechanisms responsible for various phylogeographical patterns observed in different species at varied geographical scales. Here, we used a species-rich genus Nassarius to assess and compare phylogeographical patterns in congeneric species, and discuss causes and consequences underlying varied phylogeographical patterns. Interestingly, we observed complex phylogeographical patterns both within single species and across multiple species, and multiple analyses showed varied levels of genetic heterogeneity among sites within and across species. Available evidence suggests that related species with similar biological characteristics may not be necessary to result in consistent phylogeographical patterns. Multiple factors, including larval ecology, interactions between dispersal and natural selection, and human activity-mediated dispersal, can partially explain the complex patterns observed in this study. Deep investigations should be performed on these factors, particularly their respective roles in determining evolutionary/ecological processes to form phylogeographical patterns in species with high dispersal capacities in marine and coastal ecosystems.

T1  - How do waterbirds respond to climate change? A study at a key wintering site in Europe
AN  - 1953065353
AB  - Many species of birds react to climate change, for example, by wintering in areas closer to their breeding areas. We investigated the responses of two different functional groups of waterbirds to factors associated with climate change. The Odra River Estuary (SW Baltic Sea) is of key importance to wintering waterfowl. The most numerous birds here belong to two ecological groups: benthic feeders and fish feeders. We showed that numbers of all benthivorous waterbirds were negatively correlated with the presence of ice, but failed to find such a relationship for piscivores. We anticipated that, with ongoing global warming, the significance of this area would increase for benthic feeders but decrease for fish feeders: our results bore this out. The maximum range of ice cover in the Baltic Sea has a weak and negative effect on both groups of birds. Five of the seven target species are benthivores (Greater Scaup Aythya marila, Tufted Duck A. fuligula, Common Pochard A. ferina, Common Goldeneye Bucephala clangula and Eurasian Coot Fulica atra), while the other two are piscivores (Smew Mergellus albellus and Goosander Mergus merganser). Local changes at the level of particular species vary for different reasons. The local decline of Common Pochard may be a reflection of the species’ global decline. Climate change may be responsible for some of the local changes in the study area, namely, the significance of the area has increased for Greater Scaup and Tufted Duck but declined for Smew.

T1  - Establishment of a taxonomic and molecular reference collection to support the identification of species regulated by the Western Australian Prevention List for Introduced Marine Pests
AN  - 2287044662
AB  - Introduced Marine Pests (IMP, = non-indigenous marine species) prevention, early detection and risk-based management strategies have become the priority for biosecurity operations worldwide, in recognition of the fact that, once established, the effective management of marine pests can rapidly become cost prohibitive or impractical. In Western Australia (WA), biosecurity management is guided by the “Western Australian Prevention List for Introduced Marine Pests” which is a policy tool that details species or genera as being of high risk to the region. This list forms the basis of management efforts to prevent introduction of these species, monitoring efforts to detect them at an early stage, and rapid response should they be detected. It is therefore essential that the species listed can be rapid and confidently identified and discriminated from native species by a range of government and industry stakeholders. Recognising that identification of these species requires very specialist expertise which may be in short supply and not readily accessible in a regulatory environment, and the fact that much publicly available data is not verifiable or suitable for regulatory enforcement, the WA government commissioned the current project to collate a reference collection of these marine pest specimens. In this work, we thus established collaboration with researchers worldwide in order to source representative specimens of the species listed. Our main objective was to build a reference collection of taxonomically vouchered specimens and subsequently to generate species-specific DNA barcodes suited to supporting their future identification. To date, we were able to obtain specimens of 75 species (representative of all but four of the pests listed) which have been identified by experts and placed with the WA Government Department of Fisheries and, where possible, in accessible museums and institutions in Australasia. The reference collection supports the fast and reliable taxonomic and molecular identification of marine pests in WA and constitutes a valuable resource for training of stakeholders with interest in IMP recognition in Australia. The reference collection is also useful in supporting the development of a variety of DNA-based detection strategies such as real-time PCR and metabarcoding of complex environmental samples (e.g. biofouling communities). The Prevention List is under regular review to ensure its continued relevance and that it remains evidence and risk-based. Similarly, its associated reference collection also remains to some extent a work in progress. In recognition of this fact, this report seeks to provide details of this continually evolving information repository publicly available to the biosecurity management community worldwide.

T1  - The combined effects of reactant kinetics and enzyme stability explain the temperature dependence of metabolic rates
AN  - 1908525984
AB  - A mechanistic understanding of the response of metabolic rate to temperature is essential for understanding thermal ecology and metabolic adaptation. Although the Arrhenius equation has been used to describe the effects of temperature on reaction rates and metabolic traits, it does not adequately describe two aspects of the thermal performance curve (TPC) for metabolic rate—that metabolic rate is a unimodal function of temperature often with maximal values in the biologically relevant temperature range and that activation energies are temperature dependent. We show that the temperature dependence of metabolic rate in ectotherms is well described by an enzyme‐assisted Arrhenius (EAAR) model that accounts for the temperature‐dependent contribution of enzymes to decreasing the activation energy required for reactions to occur. The model is mechanistically derived using the thermodynamic rules that govern protein stability. We contrast our model with other unimodal functions that also can be used to describe the temperature dependence of metabolic rate to show how the EAAR model provides an important advance over previous work. We fit the EAAR model to metabolic rate data for a variety of taxa to demonstrate the model's utility in describing metabolic rate TPCs while revealing significant differences in thermodynamic properties across species and acclimation temperatures. Our model advances our ability to understand the metabolic and ecological consequences of increases in the mean and variance of temperature associated with global climate change. In addition, the model suggests avenues by which organisms can acclimate and adapt to changing thermal environments. Furthermore, the parameters in the EAAR model generate links between organismal level performance and underlying molecular processes that can be tested for in future work.

T1  - A hybrid-hierarchical genome assembly strategy to sequence the invasive golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei
AN  - 1953271643
AB  - Background: For more than 25 years the golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei has been an aggressive invader in South America freshwaters, having travelled more than 5,000 km upstream across 5 countries. The mussel has outcompeted native species in the invaded environments and since chemicals in the water have been unable to control infestation in closed environments, it has economically harmed aquaculture, hydroelectric generation and ship transit. We sequenced the complete genome of the golden mussel to try to understand the molecular basis of its invasiveness and search for ways to control it. Findings: We have assembled the 1.6 Gb genome into 20548 scaffolds with a N50 length of 312 Kb using a hybrid and hierarchical assembly strategy from short and long DNA reads and transcriptomes. A total of 60717 coding genes were inferred from a customized transcriptome-trained AUGUSTUS run. We also compared predicted protein sets with those of complete molluscan genomes, revealing an exacerbation of protein-binding domains in L. fortunei. Conclusions: We assembled one of the best bivalve genomes available using a cost-effective approach using Illumina pair-end, mate pair and PacBio long reads. We expect the continuous and careful annotation of L. fortunei’s genome to aid to the investigation of bivalve genetics, evolution and invasiveness, as well as the development of biotechnological tools for aquatic pest control.

T1  - Sensitivity and accuracy of high-throughput metabarcoding methods for early detection of invasive fish species
AN  - 1903445128
AB  - High-throughput DNA metabarcoding has gained recognition as a potentially powerful tool for biomonitoring, including early detection of aquatic invasive species (AIS). DNA based techniques are advancing, but our understanding of the limits to detection for metabarcoding complex samples is inadequate. For detecting AIS at an early stage of invasion when the species is rare, accuracy at low detection limits is key. To evaluate the utility of metabarcoding in future fish community monitoring programs, we conducted several experiments to determine the sensitivity and accuracy of routine metabarcoding methods. Experimental mixes used larval fish tissue from multiple "common" species spiked with varying proportions of tissue from an additional "rare" species. Pyrosequencing of genetic marker, COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) and subsequent sequence data analysis provided experimental evidence of low-level detection of the target "rare" species at biomass percentages as low as 0.02% of total sample biomass. Limits to detection varied interspecifically and were susceptible to amplification bias. Moreover, results showed some data processing methods can skew sequence-based biodiversity measurements from corresponding relative biomass abundances and increase false absences. We suggest caution in interpreting presence/absence and relative abundance in larval fish assemblages until metabarcoding methods are optimized for accuracy and precision.

T1  - How are coastal benthos fed?
AN  - 2290076049
AB  - Water movement can influence the distribution of benthos, in part, by increasing food delivery; however, the impact of advective transport and turbulent diffusion on organic matter flux to nearshore benthic communities is not well quantified. In this study, we measured the vertical particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate phosphorus (PP) flux in nearshore Lake Michigan using two naturally occurring daughter/parent radionuclide pairs (234Th/238U and 90Y/90Sr) and compared these fluxes to coincident benthic chamber estimates of respiration and total phosphorus efflux by quagga mussels on the lakebed. We found that advective onshore transport and vertical convective mixing increased POC and PP flux to the nearshore benthos by a factor of ∼ 15 and ∼ 30 over offshore trap‐derived estimates of flux. From these results, we hypothesize that high benthos population densities are related to an edge effect created when the dominant mechanism of particle delivery transitions from gravitational settling to convection.

T1  - Étude de la Présence, du Devenir et de L'impact des Psychotropes dans la Garonne Estuarienne (France) et le Fleuve Saint Laurent (Québec, Canada)
TT  - Study of the Presence, Future and Impact of Psychotropic Drugs in the Garonne Estuary (France) and the Saint Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada)
AN  - 2866088316
AB  - L’urbanisation croissante et la propagation des activités humaines entrainent l’augmentation de l’apport de nombreux micropolluants dans le milieu aquatique. Le compartiment aquatique est alors défini comme le réceptacle ultime de la pollution environnementale apportée par diverses sources : les effluents municipaux et industriels, les lixiviats des sites d’élimination des déchets solides, le ruissellement des eaux urbaines et des eaux des sites agricoles.Parmi les contaminants retrouvés dans l’eau, il y a les psychotropes (benzodiazépines, antidépresseurs, antiépileptiques, etc…) qui appartiennent à la grande famille des médicaments. Ce sont des molécules biologiquement actives, ubiquistes, qui sont principalement d’origine urbaine, qui sont apportées continuellement dans l’environnement aquatique et qui sont fortement consommées au niveau mondial.Depuis quelques années, les scientifiques commencent à s’intéresser à cette famille thérapeutique mais il existe encore un réel manque de connaissance sur l’intégralité du problème de diffusion des psychotropes, de leur passage en station d’épuration à leur présence dans l’environnement et enfin à leur impact sur les organismes aquatiques. Ces travaux de thèse cherchent donc à documenter ce point en se focalisant sur l’étude de la présence, du devenir et de l’impact des psychotropes dans la Garonne estuarienne (France) et le fleuve Saint Laurent (Québec, Canada).Dans un premier temps, une méthode analytique multi-résidus permettant l’analyse de 47 psychotropes dans les eaux usées et les eaux de surface a été développée et validée. Des échantillonneurs passifs de type POCIS (Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler) ont été calibrés et validés afin de permettre le suivi intégratif et continu des psychotropes dans les eaux de surface.Dans un second temps, les effluents d’entrée et de sortie de station d’épuration des agglomérations de Bordeaux en France et de Repentigny et Montréal au Québec ont été caractérisés. Les résultats de cette étude montrent que les traitements épuratoires de chacune des stations d’épurations étudiées ont une efficacité limitée pour éliminer les psychotropes dans les eaux usées. Par la suite, le suivi effectué dans la Garonne estuarienne et dans le fleuve Saint Laurent a mis en évidence la présence de psychotropes dans l’environnement qui sont majoritairement apportés par l’amont des villes de Bordeaux et Montréal.La comparaison des résultats obtenus pour la France et le Québec montre qu’il existe bien des habitudes de prescriptions et de consommations différentes entre les deux pays. Même si les procédés d’épuration sont différents entre les deux pays (traitement secondaire en France et primaire au Québec), l’efficacité d’élimination sur la famille thérapeutique des psychotropes reste insuffisante. Enfin il a été observé que le débit du milieu récepteur jouait un rôle important dans la dilution et le devenir des composés.Dans un troisième et dernier temps, des études in vitro et in vivo ont montré que certains psychotropes pouvaient avoir un impact toxique sur les bivalves d’eau douce étudiés (Elliptio complanata et Corbicula fluminea) lors d’exposition de composés seuls ou en mélange à des concentrations de l’ordre du mg.L-1 (concentrations expérimentales) et même du ng.L-1(concentrations environnementales).Alternate abstract:Increasing urbanization and human activities cause an increase of micropollutant input in the aquatic environment. The water compartment is then defined as the ultimate receptacle of environmental pollution originating from various sources: municipal and industrial wastewaters, leachates from solid waste disposal sites, waters of urban and agricultural runoff.Among the contaminants found in the water, there are psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants or antiepileptics) belonging to the family of pharmaceuticals. These are biologically active molecules, ubiquitous, which are mainly of urban origin, which are continuously introduced into the aquatic environment and are heavily consumed around the world.In recent years, scientists have begun to show interest for this therapeutic family, but there is still a real lack of knowledge about the full psychotropic diffusion problem; from their presence in wastewater treatment plant to their presence in the environment and finally to their impact on aquatic organisms.In this global perspective these thesis works seek to document the presence, fate and impact of psychotropic drugs in the Garonne estuary (France) and the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada). Firstly, a multi-residue analytical method for the analysis of 47 psychotropic drugs in wastewater and surface waters has been developed and validated. POCIS passive samplers were calibrated and validated for continuous integrative monitoring of psychotropic drugs in surface waters.Secondly, the treatment plant influents and effluents of Bordeaux in France and Repentigny and Montreal in Quebec have been characterized. The results of this study show that treatment processes of studied wastewater treatment plants have limited performances to remove psychotropic drugs in wastewaters. Thereafter, the monitoring performed in the Garonne estuarine and in the St. Lawrence River has highlighted that the presence of psychotropic drug in the environment is mainly related to upstream input of Bordeaux and Montréal.Comparison of the results obtained in the two countries surveyed show that there are many different patterns of prescriptions and consumption between the two countries. Although the treatment processes are different between the two countries (secondary treatment in France and primary in Quebec), their removal efficiency is still insufficient for psychotropic drugs. Finally it was observed that the flow rate of the receiving environment plays an important role in the dilution and the fate of the compounds.In a third and final stage, in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that some psychotropic drugs could have a toxic impact on the studied freshwater bivalves (Elliptio complanata and Corbicula fluminea) upon exposure alone or in mixture with concentrations in the order of mg.L-1 (tests concentrations) and even ng.L-1(environmental concentrations).

T1  - Impacts Cumulatifs des Contaminants et des Facteurs Biologiques sur les Réponses de Biomarqueurs Moléculaires et Histopathologiques Chez L’anguille Atlantique
AN  - 2812056607
AB  - Historiquement abondante et répandue en Europe et en Amérique du Nord, l’anguille européenne (Anguilla anguilla) et l’anguille d’Amérique (Anguilla rostrata) sont des espèces en déclin ayant des cycles de vie semblables. Les explications possibles de ce déclin incluent les changements climatiques, la surpêche, la dégradation de l'habitat, le parasitisme et la contamination. Confrontée à un mélange de contaminants et à des facteurs de stress environnementaux de plus en plus nombreux, l’anguille subit un stress pouvant provoquer l’apparition de dommages cellulaires, l’apparition de lésions histopathologiques et affecter sa croissance, sa reproduction ou sa survie. De plus, les gradients écologiques tels que la localisation géographique, la distance de la zone de frai et les conditions physicochimiques de l’habitat de croissance affectent directement ou indirectement le taux de croissance et la taille de l’anguille, ce qui pourrait affecter également l'absorption, la distribution, le métabolisme et le taux d’accumulation des contaminants. Cette étude spatiale (huit sites et deux pays) et comparative (deux espèces d’anguille) a pour objectif de déterminer l’impact d’un mélange complexe de contaminants (organiques et métalliques) sur l’état de santé de l’anguille européenne et américaine au stade jaune en tenant compte des facteurs environnementaux et biologiques. À cette fin, une batterie de biomarqueurs associée aux enzymes de biotransformation, aux capacités antioxydantes et aux lésions histopathologiques a été utilisée. L’activité de l'enzyme éthoxyrésorufine O-dééthylase (EROD) et les activités antioxydantes de la catalase (CAT) et de la superoxyde dismutase (SOD) ont été mesurées dans le foie. Les mesures de la densité et de la surface des centres mélanomacrophages (CMM) ainsi que les dépôts pigmentaires d’hémosidérine et de lipofuscine ont été déterminés dans la rate des anguilles. À l'été 2011 et 2012, les anguilles jaunes (stade de croissance) ont été recueillies à deux sites de référence et deux sites contaminés le long du Système du Saint-Laurent (SSL) et du Système de la Gironde (SG). Les concentrations tissulaires des contaminants organiques et inorganiques ont été mesurées dans les anguilles. Notre étude a démontré que les anguilles américaines originaires des sites en amont du SSL présentaient des croissances significativement plus rapides que celles originaires des sites en aval contrairement aux anguilles européennes originaires de l’amont du SG qui avaient des croissances plus lentes que celles situées en aval. Ce résultat remet en question le paradigme courant concernant le patron de variabilité spatiale des taux de croissance chez A. rostrata. Par la suite, des relations entre les variables biologiques, les contaminants et les biomarqueurs ont été mises en évidence et interprétées à l’aide d’analyses en composantes principales (ACP). Chez l’anguille américaine, aucune influence majeure des contaminants organiques persistants sur l'activité hépatique d’EROD, les enzymes antioxydantes et les biomarqueurs histopathologiques n’a été identifiée dans les anguilles échantillonnées dans les sites contaminés et de référence. Chez l’anguille européenne, des relations entre la contamination organique (PCB, PBDE et DDT et métabolites) et les niveaux d’activité de la CAT et entre la contamination métallique (mercure et cadmium) et la densité des CMM ont été mis en évidence chez les anguilles des sites contaminés.Alternate abstract:Historically abundant and widespread in Europe and North America, the European eel (Anguilla anguilla) and the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) are declining species with similar life cycles. Possible explanations for this decline include climate change, overfishing, habitat degradation, parasitism and contamination.The presence of complex mixtures of contaminants combined with other potentially confounding factors (i.e. natural factors) are known to cause cell damage, histopathological lesions and could affect eel growth, its reproduction or survival. Moreover, ecological gradients such as latitudinal cline, distances from the spawning site, and physicochemical conditions (for example, salinity and temperature) of eel’s growth habitat could directly or indirectly affect eel’s growth rate and could also influence the absorption, distribution, metabolism and accumulation of contaminants. The present field study was conducted on Atlantic eels in eight sites varying in organic and metal contamination along the Saint Lawrence and the Gironde systems, respectively. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of contaminants on the health status of Atlantic yellow eels, taking into account environmental and biological factors related to the sampling. To the end, a battery of biomarkers was used: liver ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity, antioxidant enzymes (catalase and superoxide dismutase) and spleen histopathological biomarkers (density and surface of MelanoMacrophage Centers (MMCs), hemosiderin and lipofuscin pigments). EROD, CAT and SOD enzymatic activities were measured in the liver. Density, surface of MMCs as well as deposition of hemosiderin and lipofuscin pigments were determined in spleen. In summer 2011 and 2012, yellow eels were collected at two reference sites and two contaminated sites along the St. Lawrence System and the Gironde System (SG). Concentrations of organic and inorganic contaminants were measured in eel tissues.Our study showed that the early size-at-age of A. anguilla were higher in downstream and more saline Gironde system habitats than in the upstream fluvial section and that early size-at-age of A. rostrata from the upstream Saint Lawrence system, most distant from the spawning area, exceeds those of eels sampled downstream, at less distant sites in the estuarine section. This result calls into question the current paradigm concerning the pattern of spatial variability of growth rates in A. rostrata. Then, principal component analysis was useful to discriminate effects of anthropogenic contaminant gradients, biological characteristics on biomarker responses, over a large geographic scale. For A. rostrata, no major influences of persistent organic contaminants on hepatic EROD activity, antioxidant enzymes and splenic histopathological biomarkers were identified in eels sampled in contaminated and reference sites. For A. anguilla, higher hepatic catalase activity in eels from contaminated sites was related to higher concentration of organic contaminants (DDT and metabolites, sum of PCBs, sum of PBDEs) and density of MMC in eels from the contaminated river Garonne with higher muscle Hg and Cd. In both species, higher depositions of spleen hemosiderin pigment were measured in eels from the most brackish sites compared to eels living in freshwater environments. Results showed a possible association between higher hemosiderin pigment and metals contamination (Arsenic for A. anguilla and lead for A. rostrata). In comparison to its American cousin from the SLS, A. anguilla from Southwest France may be more affected by contaminants.

Plankton samples were collected from 10 transects through this stretch of the river (230 Km), near the banks and on the center, as well on seven of its tributaries. Results: 118 ciliate species were identified, among which the peritrichs were the most abundant while the order Hymenostomatida was the most specious group. We recorded a remarkable increase in abundance and species richness along the river, especially in the rainy period. Moreover, in this period we found an increase in the beta-diversity along the river, which consists in a remarkable distinction among the low, middle and high stretch ofthe river. In this way, continuous changes in the community structure of planktonic ciliates were evidenced, highlighting the importance of the precipitation and tributaries in the maintenance of the highest regional diversity in the studied area. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest the requirement for conservation actions with the purpose to maintain those tributaries undammed, in order to avoid biotic homogenization processes and the consequent reduction of aquatic biodiversity in this important neotropical ecosystem.Alternate abstract:Objetivo: Investigaram-se no presente estudo os padröes espaciáis e temporais da abundancia e diversidade de espécies da comunidade de ciliados planctónicos, no último trecho livre de barramentos da planicie de inundaçâo do alto rio Paraná, Brasil. Métodos: Sete amostragens foram realizadas no periodo de dois anos. Amostras de ciliados foram coletadas ao longo de 10 transectos deste rio (230 Km), nas margens e no centro, bem como em sete de seus tributários. Resultados: Cento e dezoito espécies foram identificadas, dentre as quais, a ordem Peritrichia foi a mais abundante e Hymenostomatida a mais especiosa. Foi evidenciado um aumento na abundancia e riqueza de espécies ao longo do rio, especialmente no periodo chuvoso. Além disso, neste periodo foi registrado um incremento da diversidade beta ao longo do rio, consistindo em uma grande diferença entre os trechos a montante, intermediário e jusante da área de estudo. Assim, a gradativa alteraçâo na estrutura da comunidade de ciliados evidenciou uma grande influencia das chuvas e dos tributários na manutençâo da alta diversidade regional no trecho estudado. Conclusao: Os resultados evidenciam a necessidade de açöes de conservaçâo com o intuito de preservar os tributários livres de barramentos, a fim de evitar processos de homogeneizaçâo biótica e a consequente reduçâo da biodiversidade aquática neste importante ecossistema neotropical.

T1  - Cyanobacterial Toxins of the Laurentian Great Lakes, Their Toxicological Effects, and Numerical Limits in Drinking Water
AN  - 2108556525
AB  - Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous phototrophic bacteria that inhabit diverse environments across the planet. Seasonally, they dominate many eutrophic lakes impacted by excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) forming dense accumulations of biomass known as cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms or cyanoHABs. Their dominance in eutrophic lakes is attributed to a variety of unique adaptations including N and P concentrating mechanisms, N2 fixation, colony formation that inhibits predation, vertical movement via gas vesicles, and the production of toxic or otherwise bioactive molecules. While some of these molecules have been explored for their medicinal benefits, others are potent toxins harmful to humans, animals, and other wildlife known as cyanotoxins. In humans these cyanotoxins affect various tissues, including the liver, central and peripheral nervous system, kidneys, and reproductive organs among others. They induce acute effects at low doses in the parts-per-billion range and some are tumor promoters linked to chronic diseases such as liver and colorectal cancer. The occurrence of cyanoHABs and cyanotoxins in lakes presents challenges for maintaining safe recreational aquatic environments and the production of potable drinking water. CyanoHABs are a growing problem in the North American (Laurentian) Great Lakes basin. This review summarizes information on the occurrence of cyanoHABs in the Great Lakes, toxicological effects of cyanotoxins, and appropriate numerical limits on cyanotoxins in finished drinking water.

T1  - Accumulation of Microcystin (LR, RR and YR) in Three Freshwater Bivalves in Microcystis aeruginosa Bloom Using Dual Isotope Tracer
AN  - 2108419374
AB  - Abstract: Stable isotope tracers were first applied to evaluate the Microcystis cell assimilation efficiency of Sinanodonta bivalves, since the past identification method has been limited to tracking the changes of each chl-a, clearity, and nutrient. The toxicity profile and accumulation of MC-LR, -RR and -YR in different organs (foot and digestive organs) from the three filter-feeders (Sinanodonta woodina, Sinanodonta arcaeformis, and Unio douglasiae) were assessed under the condition of toxigenic cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) blooms through an in situ pond experiment using 13C and 15N dual isotope tracers. Chl-a concentration in the manipulated pond was dramatically decreased after the beginning of the second day, ranging from 217.5 to 15.6 μg·L−1. The highest amount of MCs was incorporated into muscle and gland tissues in U. douglasiae during the study period, at nearly 2 or 3 times higher than in S.woodiana and S. arcaeformis. In addition, the incorporated 13C and 15N atom % in the U. douglasiae bivalve showed lower values than in other bivalves. The results demonstrate that U. douglasiae has less capacity to assimilate toxic cyanobacteria derived from diet. However, the incorporated 13C and 15N atom % of S. arcaeformis showed a larger feeding capacity than U. douglasiae and S. wodiana. Our results therefore also indicate that S. arcaeformis can eliminate the toxin more rapidly than U. douglasiae, having a larger detoxification capacity.

T1  - To what extend the dam dredging can influence the background level of metals in the Rhine River: using chemical and biological long-term monitoring to answer
AN  - 2056756943
AB  - Dredging generates remobilisation of sediments contaminated by non-degradable compounds such as metals, to which aquatic organisms can be exposed. This study aims at assessing the environmental impact of sediments remobilised in the Rhine River (France) during the dredging of Marckolsheim dam by pumping/dilution in 2013 on metal speciation and organisms' exposure. The monitoring coupling chemical and biological tools was performed 2 years before dredging operation on 2 sampling sites, upstream and downstream from the discharge of pumping/dilution, to acquire data on the natural variability of labile (DGT as passive samplers), dissolved and particulate concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn, Pb and Zn in Rhine during full hydrological cycles. In parallel, size-calibrated zebra mussels were transplanted at both sites to monitor continuously metal bioavailability from particulate and dissolved fractions. This long-term monitoring allowed the establishment of reference baselines of Rhine water and mussels' contamination levels and subsequently, the detection of averred environmental changes due to the dredging. Indeed, Co and Mn accumulations in mussels exposed to the discharge were consistent with increasing labile species in Rhine whereas ones of Cr and Pb were likely due to an enhanced particulate bioavailability. Whatever the exposure route, the mussels recovered their basal metal contents 2 weeks after the end of dredging, suggesting a transient impact of sediment remobilisation on bioaccumulation. This long-term monitoring highlights the interest of coupling chemical and biological time-integrated tools for a better assessment of environmental risks because metallic exchanges between organisms and their media are complex and metal-specific.
Une opération de dragage engendre la remobilisation de sédiments contaminés par des composés non dégradables tels que les métaux, auxquels les organismes aquatiques peuvent être exposés. Cette étude vise à évaluer l'impact environnemental de la remobilisation de sédiments chargés en métaux dans le Rhin lors du dragage du barrage de Marckolsheim par pompage/dilution en 2013 sur la spéciation et l'exposition des organismes aux métaux. La surveillance chimique et biologique a été effectuée 2 ans avant l'opération de dragage sur 2 sites d'échantillonnage, en amont et en aval de la zone de rejet, pour acquérir des données sur l'évolution naturelle des concentrations labiles, dissoute et particulaires en Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn, Pb et en Zn dans le Rhin pendant des cycles hydrologiques complets. En parallèle, des moules zébrées calibrées ont été transplantées sur les deux sites pour surveiller la biodisponibilité particulaire et dissoute des métaux. Cette surveillance à long terme a permis d'établir des niveaux de contamination de référence du Rhin et des moules, et ainsi de détecter des changements environnementaux dus au dragage. En effet, les accumulations de Co et de Mn dans les moules exposées au rejet concordaient avec l'augmentation de leurs formes labiles dans l'eau du Rhin alors que celles de Cr et Pb étaient probablement liées à une biodisponibilité particulaire favorisée par la remobilisation de sédiments. Quelle que soit la voie d'exposition, les moules ont récupéré leur teneur basale en métaux 2 semaines après la fin du dragage, suggérant un impact transitoire de la remobilisation des sédiments sur la bioaccumulation. Cette surveillance à long terme met aussi en évidence l'intérêt de coupler des outils chimiques et biologiques pour une meilleure évaluation des risques environnementaux car les échanges métalliques entre les organismes et leurs milieux sont complexes et dépendent du métal considéré.

T1  - Measuring and Modeling the Effect of PCB Bioavailability on Accumulation in Aquatic Food Chains
AN  - 1984321808
AB  - The primary goal for remediation of sediments contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is the reduction of bioaccumulation in the aquatic food web, particularly in fish that is the source of exposure to top level predators and humans. While empirical results are available in the literature on bioavailability reductions after amendment of PCB-contaminated sediment with a strong sorbent like activated carbon (AC) or biochar, there is a lack of quantitative understanding on how reductions in sediment porewater and food concentrations impact accumulation in fish. Although passive sampling can measure freely dissolved concentrations accurately, there is a major gap in the utilization of fate and biouptake models that can use such measurements. In addition, well-calibrated partitioning models based on accurate freely dissolved concentrations that can predict uptake by pelagic organisms are lacking. The primary objective of this research was to test the ability of frequently used bioaccumulation models to predict changes in fish uptake upon amendment of AC sediment and use passive sampling inputs and additional studies to refine the predictions made by these bioaccumulation models.    Results from laboratory exposure studies with pelagic and benthic feeding fish indicate that by incorporating changes in porewater and overlying freely dissolved PCB concentrations in kinetic bioaccumulation models and by taking into account changes in food concentration it is possible to predict effectiveness of sediment remediation in reducing PCB uptake in fish. Assimilation efficiency of PCBs in the sediment were independently measured in a separate study and incorporated into the model. The modified model led to reasonable estimations of PCB uptake in the benthic feeding fish and was capable of predicting the dominant exposure pathways in the benthic and pelagic feeding fish as a result of their different feeding behaviour. Additionally, passive sampling measurements were linked to PCB accumulation in algae and zooplankton and resulted in refined models. Lastly, several scenarios were simulated to show the potential of a linked fate and biouptake model to capture the effect of different inputs.    This research presents a robust modeling framework that is able to predict uptake in fish after in situ remediation that alters bioavailability of PCBs in sediments with implications for risk assessment and management.

T1  - Do local enemies attack alien and native Impatiens alike?
AN  - 1977598689
AB  - The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) attributes the invasive behavior of some alien species to decreased pressure from natural enemies, as they have been left behind in the hosts’ native range. The majority of research supports this idea, but some studies confirm it only partially or even contradict it. Here, we present the results of ERH tests of three Impatiens species studied in southern Poland in 2010–2011. Two of them are alien and invasive in Europe (Impatiens glandulifera, I. parviflora) and one is native (I. noli-tangere). We compared the three species in terms of the percentage of all leaves showing symptoms of disease and/or damage, and also the number of pests recorded on the monitored plants. In 1071 individual plant controls, we assessed 17 180 leaves, 7552 of which showed symptoms of disease/damage, and we recorded 5721 invertebrates, 5220 of them were pests. Rusts and spots were the predominant symptoms and Aphidoidea were the dominant group of pests. Comparisons of the two alien and one native Impatiens did not confirm the ERH in 90% of the performed tests. Most of the differences between the species were not significant, and most of the significant ones contradicted the ERH. The only results confirming the ERH were found in comparisons between I. parviflora and I. noli-tangere. The tests between two alien species showed that I. parviflora was under higher pest pressure, while I. glandulifera had more disease and damage symptoms, thus, plant–enemy relations differed between the two balsams. In summary, the presented results add evidence that the success of some alien species may depend on factors related to biotic and/or abiotic conditions in ways that are not explained by the enemy release hypothesis.

T1  - Tracking the Recovery of Freshwater Mussel Diversity in Ontario Rivers: Evaluation of a Quadrat-Based Monitoring Protocol
AN  - 1889002814
AB  - Watershed inventories and population monitoring are essential components of efforts to conserve and recover freshwater mussel diversity in Canada. We used two datasets to assess the efficacy of a quadrat-based sampling protocol for: (1) detecting mussel species at risk; (2) characterizing species composition; (3) providing accurate estimates of abundance; and (4) detecting changes in density. The protocol is based on a systematic design (with random starts) that samples 20% of monitoring sites with visual-tactile surface searches and excavation of 1 m2 quadrats. The first dataset included 40 sampling sites in five Ontario rivers, and the second dataset consisted of complete census sampling at two 375 m2 sites that represented contrasting mussel assemblages. Our results show that the protocol can be expected to detect the majority of species present at a site and provide accurate and precise estimates of total mussel density. Excavation was essential for detection of small individuals and to accurately estimate abundance. However, the protocol was of limited usefulness for reliable detection of most species at risk. Furthermore, imprecise density estimates precluded detection of all but the most extreme changes in density of most individual species. Meeting monitoring objectives will require either substantially greater sampling effort under the current protocol, or a fundamental revision of the sampling approach.

T1  - Screening of 17α-ethynylestradiol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals accumulation in Mytilus edulis trossulus (Gould, 1890) collected from the Gulf of Gdańsk
AN  - 2812052945
AB  - Pharmaceuticals are commonly found in water collected from wastewater treatment plants, fresh water and saline water. Their presence in water may result in constant accumulation in living organisms, and consequently a negative impact on those organisms. Abiotic samples collected from the Gulf of Gdańsk were already proven to be polluted by several classes of pharmaceuticals, but the bioaccumulation was not investigated as far. This study presents the first results on the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in Mytilus edulis trossulus (Gould 1890) mussels collected from the Gulf of Gdańsk. The content of target 6 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, diclofenac, paracetamol, naproxen, ketoprofen) and 17α-ethynylestradiol in water and tissue samples was determined. The selected pharmaceuticals (paracetamol, flurbiprofen, 17α-ethynylestradiol) were found only in the largest individuals. The in situ BAFs calculated for paracetamol and flurbiprofen were 2850 and 16154 l kg-1 (dry weight), respectively, suggesting a high potential for the bioaccumulation of these compounds. The synthetic hormone 17α-ethynylestradiol was also found in the collected mussels at the concentration of 310 ng g-1 of dry weight. Generally, the examined mussels showed poor condition and it is highly likely that the accumulated pharmaceuticals are one of the important factors contributing to this.

T1  - Modelling the biological invasion of Carcinus maenas (the European green crab)
AN  - 2335158556
AB  - This paper proposes a system of integro-difference equations to model the spread of Carcinus maenas, commonly called the European green crab, that causes severe damage to coastal ecosystems. A model with juvenile and adult classes is first studied. Here, standard theory of monotone operators for integro-difference equations can be applied and yields explicit formulas for the asymptotic spreading speeds of the juvenile and adult crabs. A second model including an infected class is considered by introducing a castrating parasite Sacculina carcini as a biological control agent. The dynamics are complicated and simulations reveal the occurrence of periodic solutions and stacked fronts. In this case, only conjectures can be made for the asymptotic spreading speeds because of the lack of mathematical theory for non-monotone operators. This paper also emphasizes the need for mathematical studies of non-monotone operators in heterogeneous environments and the existence of stacked front solutions in biological invasion models.

T1  - Age, growth and population structure of invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) in northeast Florida using a length-based, age-structured population model
AN  - 1950313682
AB  - The effective management of invasive species requires detailed understanding of the invader’s life history. This information is essential for modeling population growth and predicting rates of expansion, quantifying ecological impacts and assessing the efficacy of removal and control strategies. Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) have rapidly invaded the western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea with documented negative impacts on native ecosystems. To better understand the life history of this species, we developed and validated a length-based, age-structured model to investigate age, growth and population structure in northeast Florida. The main findings of this study were: (1) lionfish exhibited rapid growth with seasonal variation in growth rates; (2) distinct cohorts were clearly identifiable in the length-frequency data, suggesting that lionfish are recruiting during a relatively short period in summer; and (3) the majority of lionfish were less than two years old with no lionfish older than three years of age, which may be the result of culling efforts as well as ontogenetic habitat shifts to deeper water.

T1  - High Frequency Non-invasive (HFNI) Bio-Sensors As a Potential Tool for Marine Monitoring and Assessments
AN  - 2307430142
AB  - Marine ecosystems all over the globe are facing multiple simultaneous stressors including rapid climatic change and increased resource exploitation, such as fishing, petroleum exploration and shipping. The EU-funded DEVOTES project (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) aims to better understand the relationships between pressures from human activities and climatic influences and their effects on marine ecosystems. To achieve these goals, it is necessary among others, to test and validate innovative monitoring tools to improve our understanding of ecosystem and biodiversity changes. This paper outlines the application of a high frequency non-invasive (HFNI) valvometer as a potential tool for long-term marine monitoring and assessments. The principle of the method is based on the regular gaping behaviour (closing and opening of the valves) of bivalve molluscs and the fact that physical or chemical stressors disrupt that gaping reference pattern. Bivalve gaping behaviour is monitored in the natural environment, remotely, continuously over a time period of years, requirements that must be fulfilled if bivalve behaviour is to be a useful biomonitoring tool. Here, we review the literature and highlight potential uses of the HFNI valvometry as a biosensor, to monitor and provide early-warning alerts of changes in water quality, such as global temperature increase, releases of contaminants and toxic algal blooms. Finally, potential relevant applications for monitoring and assessing environmental status of marine waters in the context of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive are identified. Relevant descriptors, Criteria and Indicators of Good Environmental Status that might be monitored using the HFNI valvometer are discussed for monitoring bathing beaches and harbours, petroleum installations and aquaculture sites.

AB  - This is most evident in J. Hugh McMorrow's demand that those in the other camp "get (their) ears fixed to become more tolerant of others, rather than trying to impose (their) view on council and (those citizens) who support the tradition," and his pompous approval that Winnipeg's council has not "succumbed to the minority pressure" -- as if to brush away everyone else's citizenship rights and civil liberties.              Both Alfredo Velasco and Dolly Dennis, meanwhile, contend falsely that [Tony Governo]'s request infringes on councillors' rights. Neither of their attempts to deploy John Stuart Mill's harm principle works, because Governo's qualm comes from the fact that council has not held up its own end of the same bargain.              Secondly, we need to defend against the quagga mussel. This is a more cold-water-tolerant relative of the zebra mussel now in several of the Great Lakes. Are they already here? If not, rather than allocating substantial resources to a battle we've lost, make sure to put up a strong defence against the invasion of an additional threat that can influence and affect even more of our lakes (and deeper into them) than the zebra mussel.

T1  - Persistence of Low Pathogenic Influenza A Virus in Water: A Systematic Review and Quantitative Meta-Analysis
AN  - 1828678805
AB  - Avian influenza viruses are able to persist in the environment, in-between the transmission of the virus among its natural hosts. Quantifying the environmental factors that affect the persistence of avian influenza virus is important for influencing our ability to predict future outbreaks and target surveillance and control methods. We conducted a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of the environmental factors that affect the decay of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in water. Abiotic factors affecting the persistence of LPAIV have been investigated for nearly 40 years, yet published data was produced by only 26 quantitative studies. These studies have been conducted by a small number of principal authors (n = 17) and have investigated a narrow range of environmental conditions, all of which were based in laboratories with limited reflection of natural conditions. The use of quantitative meta-analytic techniques provided the opportunity to assess persistence across a greater range of conditions than each individual study can achieve, through the estimation of mean effect-sizes and relationships among multiple variables. Temperature was the most influential variable, for both the strength and magnitude of the effect-size. Moderator variables explained a large proportion of the heterogeneity among effect-sizes. Salinity and pH were important factors, although future work is required to broaden the range of abiotic factors examined, as well as including further diurnal variation and greater environmental realism generally. We were unable to extract a quantitative effect-size estimate for approximately half (50.4%) of the reported experimental outcomes and we strongly recommend a minimum set of quantitative reporting to be included in all studies, which will allow robust assimilation and analysis of future findings. In addition we suggest possible means of increasing the applicability of future studies to the natural environment, and evaluating the biological content of natural waterbodies.

T1  - Acanthaster planci invasions: applying biosecurity practices to manage a native boom and bust coral pest in Australia
AN  - 2287041494
AB  - Coral reef systems are in global decline. In Australia, much of this decline has been attributable to cyclic outbreaks (every ~17 years) of the coral-feeding crown-of-thorns seastar. While a native species, when in large enough densities the seastar acts like an invasive pest. Since 2012 the Australian government has invested significantly in a targeted control program using lethal injection. While this program is effective for individual reefs, it is not a complete strategy for the entire Great Barrier Reef (~2,500 reefs). In order to find a longer-term solution to the problem, in 2015, the lead author travelled to New Zealand, the United States, and Canada under a Churchill Fellowship to understand successful aquatic integrated pest management strategies and their potential application to the Great Barrier Reef. Meetings and workshops were convened with experts who specialise in risk assessment, categorisation, and management of aquatic invasive species. The experts comprised academics, applied scientists, policy makers, and a not for profit community based invasive species council. Bioinvasion management and prioritisation of management effort using risk-based frameworks were reviewed for application to the crown-of-thorns seastar. This viewpoint is novel in its approach of applying invasive species tools and perspectives to a non-invasive, native marine pest. Early detection and rapid response is key to preventing the transition of the seastar from natural densities to outbreak densities. However given the seastar is a native species already established, when in outbreak mode a multifaceted post-border management approach is essential. Private support funding models, that bridge conservation and tourism/philanthropy have proved successful in New Zealand to supplement government funded marine reserve management – this is an approach which should be explored by Australia to help manage the seastar. Dedicated support and commitment is needed to break the issue-attention cycle. On the Great Barrier Reef, a dedicated biosecurity approach should be used to maintain the seastar at natural densities, increase the time between outbreaks, protect coral cover and increase resilience of the system.

T1  - Age, growth and population structure of invasive lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) in northeast Florida using a length-based, age-structured population model
AN  - 1953814613
AB  - The effective management of invasive species requires a detailed understanding of the invader’s life history. This information is essential for modeling population growth and predicting rates of expansion, quantifying ecological impacts and assessing the efficacy of removal and control strategies. Indo-Pacific lionfish (  Pterois volitans/miles  ) have rapidly invaded the western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea with documented negative impacts on native ecosystems. To better understand the life history of this species, we developed and validated a length-based, age-structured model to investigate age, growth and population structure in northeast Florida. The main findings of this study were: (1) lionfish exhibited rapid growth with seasonal variation in growth rates, (2) distinct cohorts were clearly identifiable in the length-frequency data suggesting that lionfish arerecruiting during a relatively short period in summer, and (3) the majority of lionfish were less than two years old with no lionfish older than 3 years of age, possibly as a result of an ontogenetic shift to deeper water, which may provide a reservoir of spawning biomass not accessible to recreational or commercial spearfishing.

T1  - Insect Ecology:&nbsp;An Ecosystem Approach
AN  - 2134816509
AB  - Insect Ecology: An Ecosystem Approach, Fourth Edition, follows a hierarchical organization that begins with relatively easy-to-understand chapters on adaptive responses of insect populations to various environmental changes, disturbances, and anthropogenic activities, how insects find food and habitat resources, and how insects allocate available energy and nutrients. Chapters build on fundamental information to show how insect populations respond to changing environmental conditions, including spatial and temporal distribution of food and habitat. The next section integrates populations of interacting species within communities and how these interactions determine structure of communities over time and space. Other works in insect ecology stop there, essentially limiting presentation of insect ecology to evolutionary responses of insects to their environment, including the activities of other species. The unique aspect of this book is its four chapters on ecosystem structure and function, and how herbivores, pollinators, seed predators, and detritivores drive ecosystem dynamics and contribute to ecosystem stability. Provides the most advanced synthesis of insect ecology, with updated material throughout and new chapters Presents the roles of insects in delivery of ecosystem services and applications to pest management and conservation Features full coverage of ecosystem structure and function balanced with essential background on evolutionary aspects Includes case studies highlighting practical and theoretical applications for topics covered in each chapter

T1  - Western Canada unites in fight against invasive species
AN  - 1804526815
AB  - The Inter-Provincial Territorial Agreement for Co-ordinated Regional Defence Against Invasive Species is a step towards better co-ordination among jurisdictions on both prevention and co-ordinated response if invasive species are detected in Western Canada. The initial scope of this agreement will focus on aquatic invasive species. "Aquatic invasive species are a real threat to Alberta's environment and infrastructure. This partnership between western Canadian jurisdictions will help ensure our waterways are protected and our irrigation systems continue to work properly." -Shannon Phillips, Alberta Minister of Environment and Parks. "Manitoba is the gateway to the West and an important battleground in the fight against the spread of aquatic invasive species, such as zebra mussels. Working with our neighbours to the west allows us to make the most of our efforts to limit the further spread of invasive species," -Cathy Cox, Manitoba Minister of Sustainable Development.

T1  - Can mussels be used as sentinel organisms for characterization of pollution in urban water systems?
AN  - 1802433640
AB  - Urbanization strongly impacts aquatic ecosystems by decreasing water quality
and altering water cycles. Today, much effort is put towards the restoration
and conservation of urban waterbodies to enhance ecosystem service provision,
leading to liveable and sustainable cities. To enable a sustainable
management of waterbodies, the quantification of the temporal and spatial
variability of pollution levels and biogeochemical processes is essential.
Stable isotopes have widely been used to identify sources of pollution in
ecosystems. For example, increased nitrogen levels in waterbodies are often
accompanied with a higher nitrogen stable isotope signature (δ15N), which can then be detected in higher trophic levels such as
mussels. The main aim of this study was to assess the suitability of nitrogen
stable isotopes as measured in mussels (Mytilus edulis), as an
indicator able to resolve spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen
pollution in an urban, tidally influenced estuary (Swan River estuary in
Western Australia). Nitrogen concentrations were generally low and nitrogen
stable isotope values of nitrate throughout the estuary were well within
natural values of uncontaminated groundwater, organic nitrate from soils, or
marine-derived sources, indicating groundwater inflow rather than pollution
by human activity was responsible for differences between sites. The δ15N signature in mussels was very stable over time within each site which
indicated that mussels can be used as time-integrated sentinel organisms in
urban systems. In addition, our study shows that the nature of the
relationship between δ15N in the mussels and the nitrate in the
water can provide insights into site-specific biogeochemical transformation
of nutrients. We suggest that mussels and other sentinel organisms can become
a robust tool for the detection and characterization of the dynamics of a
number of emerging anthropogenic pollutants of concern in urban water
systems.

T1  - Chemical Assessment of Ballast Water Exchange Compliance: Implementation in North America and New Zealand
AN  - 2307425395
AB  - Fluorescence by naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (FDOM) is a sensitive indicator of ballast water source, with high FDOM in coastal ballast water decreasing typically dramatically when replaced by oceanic seawater during ballast water exchange. In this study, FDOM was measured in 92 ships arriving at Pacific ports on the US west coast and in New Zealand, and used to assess their compliance with ballast water regulations that required 95% replacement of port water to minimize invasive species risks. Fluorescence in many ships that reported ballast water exchange was significantly higher than is usual for oceanic seawater, and in several cases, significantly higher than in other ships with similar provenance and ballast water management. Pre-exchange source port conditions represented the largest source of uncertainty in the analysis, because residual coastal FDOM when highly fluorescent can significantly influence the fluorescence signature of exchanged ballast water. A meta-analysis comparing the intensities of FDOM in un-exchanged ballast tanks with calculated pre-exchange intensities assuming that ships all correctly implemented and reported ballast water exchange revealed notable discrepancies. Thus, the incidence of high-FDOM port waters was seven times lower in reality than would be expected on the basis of these calculations. The results suggest that a significant rate of reporting errors occur due to a combination of factors that may include inadequate ballast water exchange and unintentional or deliberate misreporting of ballast water management.

T1  - Cranbrook gets dedicated mussel station
AN  - 1779662275
AB  - Lakes and rivers in the East Kootenay will benefit from a $2-million boost to the provinces invasive mussel defence program that will see eight permanent mussel inspection stations installed at major entry points along B.C.s borders, including one located in Cranbrook, Kootenay East MLA Bill Bennett announced today.

              
Five permanent stations will be set up along the Alberta-B.C. border (Cranbrook, Invermere, Golden, Valemount and Dawson Creek), and three stations will be along the U.S.-B.C. border (Lower Mainland, Penticton and Nelson).

              
These improvements to B.C.s mussel defence program are a big step toward protecting our waterways from the threat of quagga and zebra mussels, Bennett said. Through ongoing efforts, our government is providing the necessary tools and border coverage to stop invasive mussels from entering B.C. and causing severe damage.

AB  - The knowledge on diet composition of the freshwater mussel Diplodon enno (Ortmann) would aid in its culture and propagation allowing, this way, the replacement of natural endangered populations in Brazil. Microalgae are the main food source for captive mussels and unionids have displayed an ability to sort algae based on the cellular characteristics prior to ingestion. The main objective of the present work is to analyze the phytoplankton composition of the water from and of the gastrointestinal contents of the mussel D. enno, as an initial step for development of a suitable rearing diet. The microalgal composition found in water and stomach/gut content samples was very diverse being represented by the following divisions: Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta, Dinophyta and Heterokontophyta (Diatoms). Concerning the relative abundance of microalgae divisions, it is possible to state, for the water and gastrointestinal contents, that Cyanophyta represents 15% and 14%, Chlorophyta 54% in both, Heterokontophyta 31% and 27% and Dinophyta 0% and 5%, respectively.

T1  - Linking Native and Invader Traits Explains Native Spider Population Responses to Plant Invasion
AN  - 1781328149
AB  - Theoretically, the functional traits of native species should determine how natives respond to invader-driven changes. To explore this idea, we simulated a large-scale plant invasion using dead spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe) stems to determine if native spiders’ web-building behaviors could explain differences in spider population responses to structural changes arising from C. stoebe invasion. After two years, irregular web-spiders were >30 times more abundant and orb weavers were >23 times more abundant on simulated invasion plots compared to controls. Additionally, irregular web-spiders on simulated invasion plots built webs that were 4.4 times larger and 5.0 times more likely to capture prey, leading to >2-fold increases in recruitment. Orb-weavers showed no differences in web size or prey captures between treatments. Web-spider responses to simulated invasion mimicked patterns following natural invasions, confirming that C. stoebe’s architecture is likely the primary attribute driving native spider responses to these invasions. Differences in spider responses were attributable to differences in web construction behaviors relative to historic web substrate constraints. Orb-weavers in this system constructed webs between multiple plants, so they were limited by the overall quantity of native substrates but not by the architecture of individual native plant species. Irregular web-spiders built their webs within individual plants and were greatly constrained by the diminutive architecture of native plant substrates, so they were limited both by quantity and quality of native substrates. Evaluating native species traits in the context of invader-driven change can explain invasion outcomes and help to identify factors limiting native populations.

T1  - Artificial hard substrate as a habitat for hard bottom benthic assemblages in the southern part of the Baltic Sea - a preliminary study
AN  - 1790263398
AB  - Benthic species associated with hard substrate are known to form communities characterized by high abundance and biomass. Although the bottom of the Southern Baltic Sea is dominated by soft sediments, such communities find favorable conditions to thrive on artificial substrates of offshore constructions. The aim of this research was to characterize both short-term and long-term benthic communities associated with artificial hard bottom provided by man-made structures in the Southern Baltic Sea. Species composition as well as the abundance and biomass were examined at various sites. An inactive World War II torpedo testing facility in the Gulf of Gdansk served as a site for sampling long-term communities while short-term communities were sampled using settlement panels and PVC cylinders. Panels were deployed at the torpedo testing facility for 127 days. PVC cylinders were deployed for 141-190 days in the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone. Twenty six macrofaunal taxa, including 12 crustaceans, were identified during the research. [Mytilus edulis] and [Amphibalanus improvisus] were the most abundant invertebrates at sampled surfaces. Six non-indigenous species were found. For the first time adult individuals of [Mytilopsis leucophaeata] were found in the Polish Marine Areas indicating that it is possible for this non-indigenous species to reproduce in this region.

T1  - Bivalve Grazing Can Shape Phytoplankton Communities
AN  - 2307426216
AB  - The ability of bivalve filter feeders to limit phytoplankton biomass in shallow waters is well-documented, but the role of bivalves in shaping phytoplankton communities is not. The coupled effect of bivalve grazing at the sediment-water interface and sinking of phytoplankton cells to that bottom filtration zone could influence the relative biomass of sinking (diatoms) and non-sinking phytoplankton. Simulations with a pseudo-2D numerical model showed that benthic filter feeding can interact with sinking to alter diatom:non-diatom ratios. Cases with the smallest proportion of diatom biomass were those with the fastest sinking speeds and strongest bivalve grazing rates. Hydrodynamics modulated the coupled sinking-grazing influence on phytoplankton communities. For example, in simulations with persistent stratification, the non-sinking forms accumulated in the surface layer away from bottom grazers while the sinking forms dropped out of the surface layer toward bottom grazers. Tidal-scale stratification also influenced vertical gradients of the two groups in opposite ways. The model was applied to Suisun Bay, a low-salinity habitat of the San Francisco Bay system that was transformed by the introduction of the exotic clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Simulation results for this Bay were similar to (but more muted than) those for generic habitats, indicating that P. amurensis grazing could have caused a disproportionate loss of diatoms after its introduction. Our model simulations suggest bivalve grazing affects both phytoplankton biomass and community composition in shallow waters. We view these results as hypotheses to be tested with experiments and more complex modeling approaches.

T1  - Effets des Métaux Sur le Système Sérotonine de la Moule (Mytilus edulis) et du Trophoblaste Placentaire Humain
TT  - Effects of Metals on the Serotonin System of the Mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the Human Placental Trophoblast
AN  - 2812073158
AB  - Le système de la sérotonine est présent chez les mollusques et le placenta humain. Elle y joue, entre autres, un rôle important dans la reproduction. Chez les mollusques, la sérotonine régule la ponte et la différenciation sexuelle. Chez l’humain, la sérotonine placentaire et maternelle joue un rôle dans le développement du trophoblaste placentaire et dans le développement neuronal et cardiaque du fœtus. La moule bleue et le placenta sont de bons bioindicateurs de la contamination de leur environnement respectif. Ils offrent donc un potentiel pour l’étude des effets de la contamination environnementale sur le système sérotonine. Les contaminants environnementaux, tels que les métaux, peuvent altérer le système de la sérotonine. Cependant, très peu d’études se sont intéressées aux effets des métaux sur le système sérotonine de la moule bleue et du placenta humain. L’hypothèse de recherche de ce projet doctoral est que de faibles concentrations de Mn, Pb et Cd altèrent, de manière sexespécifique, le système sérotonine, chez la moule bleue et le trophoblaste placentaire humain. L’objectif général est d’étudier l’effet des métaux sur le système de la sérotonine dans les moules (in vivo) et le trophoblaste humain (in vitro), deux modèles non invasifs et accessibles. Les objectifs spécifiques sont de : 1) Développer un protocole efficace de sexage des moules ; 2) Déterminer l’effet d’une exposition à long terme du Mn, Pb et Cd sur l’expression du SERT, les concentrations de sérotonine et l’activité de la MAO dans le la moule bleue et si les effets observés varient selon le sexe ; 3) Déterminer l’effet d’une exposition au Mn et Pb sur le système de la sérotonine du trophoblaste placentaire humain. Des Mytilus edulis et la lignée BeWo (modèle du trophoblaste villeux) ont été exposées à de faibles concentrations de Mn, Pb et Cd. Le placenta ainsi que le sang maternel et de cordon ont été recueillis d’une cohorte de femmes enceintes et les concentrations de métaux ont été déterminées. Les résultats montrent une modification du système sérotonine par une exposition à de faibles concentrations de Mn, Pb et Cd. Chez les moules bleues, une diminution de l’expression de la protéine SERT (Mn, Pb et Cd) et de l’activité de la MAO (Cd) est observée. Les moules femelles ont une activité de la MAO plus élevée que les mâles. Chez le placenta humain, les concentrations de 5-HT (Mn et Pb), la protéine SERT (Pb), l’activité de la protéine SERT (Mn et Pb) et l’activité de la MAO (Pb) diminuent. Une diminution de l’expression de l’ARNm codant pour le récepteur 5-HT2A (HTR2A) est observée aux concentrations plus élevées de Mn (> 305 nM) et de Pb (> 100 nM) dans le sang maternel. Cette étude montre que de faibles concentrations de Mn et de Pb et de Cd perturbent le système 5-HT chez Mytilus edulis et le trophoblaste placentaire humain. Puisque la sérotonine est impliquée dans les mécanismes de reproduction chez la moule et dans les fonctions du placenta humain, les modifications observées dans le système de la sérotonine pourraient avoir des répercussions sur les populations de moules, sur la santé de la grossesse et sur le développement du fœtus. Des études supplémentaires sont nécessaires pour mieux comprendre comment les métaux modulent le système 5-HT et pour déterminer si c’est un biomarqueur d’effets sur la reproduction des moules et la grossesse humaine.Alternate abstract:The serotonin system is present in molluscs and human placenta. It plays, among others, an important role in reproduction. In molluscs, serotonin regulates spawning and sexual differentiation. In humans, placental and maternal serotonin plays a role in the development of the placental trophoblast and in neuronal and cardiac fetal development. Blue mussels and placenta are good bioindicators of contamination of their respective environment. They therefore offer potential for studying environmental contamination effects on the serotonin system. Environmental contaminants, such as metals, can affect the serotonin system. However, very few studies have examined the effects of metals on the serotonin system of the blue mussel and human placenta. The research hypothesis of this doctoral project is that low concentrations of Mn, Pb and Cd alter, in a sex-specific manner, the serotonin system in blue mussels and the human placental trophoblast. The general objective is to study the effect of metals on the serotonin system in mussels (in vivo) and the human trophoblast (in vitro), two non-invasive and accessible models. The specific objectives are to: 1) Develop an effective protocol for sexing mussels; 2) Determine the effect of long-term exposure to Mn, Pb and Cd on the SERT expression, serotonin concentrations and MAO activity in the blue mussel and whether the observed effects vary depending on the sex; 3) Determine the effect of an exposure to Mn and Pb on the serotonin system of the human placental trophoblast. Mytilus edulis and the BeWo cell line (villous trophoblast model) were exposed to low concentrations of Mn, Pb and Cd. Placentas and maternal and cord blood were collected from a cohort of pregnant women and concentration metals were determined. Results show a serotonin system modification by exposure to low concentration of Mn, Pb and Cd. In blue mussels, a decrease in the SERT protein expression (Mn, Pb and Cd) and MAO activity (Cd) is observed. Female mussels have a higher MAO activity than males. In the human placenta, 5-HT concentrations (Mn and Pb), the SERT protein expression (Pb), the SERT protein activity (Mn and Pb) and the MAO activity (Pb) decreases. A decrease in the expression of mRNA encoding for the 5-HT2A receptor (HTR2A) is observed at higher concentrations of Mn (> 305 nM) and Pb (> 100 nM) in maternal blood. This study shows that low concentrations of Mn, Pb and Cd disrupt the system 5-HT in Mytilus edulis and the human placental trophoblast. Since serotonin is involved in reproduction mechanisms of mussels and human placenta functions, serotonin system modifications observed may impact the mussel population, the pregnancy health and the fetus development. Further studies are needed to better understand how metals modulate the 5 HT system and whether it is an effect biomarker for mussels reproduction and human pregnancy.

T1  - Physiological effects of biocide on marine bivalve blue mussels in context prevent macrofouling
AN  - 2575269352
AB  - Background
Mussels are stubborn organisms attached to solid substrata by means of byssus threads. The abundance of marine mussel Mytilus edulis in marine facilities like power stations was reason to select among fouling animals.
Methods
Mortality patterns as well as physiological behavior (oxygen consumption, foot activity, and byssus thread production) of two different size groups (14- and 25-mm shell length) of M. edulis were studied at different hydrogen peroxide concentrations (1–4 mg l−1).
Results
Studied mussels showed progressive reduction in physiological activities as the hydrogen peroxide concentration increased. Mussel mortality was tested in 30 days exposure, and 14 mm mussels reached the highest percentage of 90% while 25 mm mussels reached 81%. Produced data was echoed by Chick-Watson model extracted equation.
Conclusions
This study points that, while it could affect the mussel mortality moderately in its low concentrations, hydrogen peroxide has a strong influence on mussels’ physiological activities related to colonization. Therefore, hydrogen peroxide can be an alternative for preventing mussel colonization on facilities of marine environment.

T1  - Black, Grey and Watch Lists of alien species in the Czech Republic based on environmental impacts and management strategy
AN  - 2169926563
AB  - As legislation, research and management ofinvasive alien species(IAS)are not fully coordinated across countries or different stakeholder groups, one approach leading to more or less standardized activities is based on producing lists of prominentIAS that attain high level of concern and are a subject of priority monitoring and management. These so-called Black, Grey and Watch (alert) Lists represent a convenient starting point for setting priorities in prevention, early warning and management systems. It is important that these lists be based on transparent and robust criteria so as to accommodate interests and perception of impacts by groups of concerned authorities and stakeholders representing sectors as diverse as, e.g. forestry, horticulture, aquaculture, hunting, and nature conservation, and to justify possible trade restrictions. The principles for blacklisting need to be general enough to accommodate differences among taxonomic groups (plants, invertebrates, vertebrates) and invaded environments (e.g. aquatic, terrestrial, urban, suburban, seminatural), and must take into account invasion dynamics, the impact theIASpose, and management strategies suitable for each particular invader. With these assumptions in mind, we synthesize available information to present Black, Grey and Watch Lists of alien species for the Czech Republic, with recommended categorized management measures for land managers, policy makers and other stakeholders. We took into account differences in the listed species’ distribution, invasion status, known or estimated environmental impact, as well as possible management options, and apply these criteria to both plants and animals. Species with lower impact, but for which some level of management and regulation is desirable, are included on the Grey List. Some potentially dangerous species occurring in European countries with comparable climatic conditions, as well as those introduced in the past but without presently known wild populations in the Czech Republic, are listed on the Watch list. In total, there are 78 plant and 39 animal species on the Black List, 47 and 16 on the Grey List, and 25 and 27, respectively, on the Watch List. The multilayered approach to the classification of alien species, combining their impacts, population status and relevant management, can serve as a model for other countries that are in process of developing their Black Lists.

T1  - Further expansion of the invasive mussel Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834) in Poland – establishment of a new locality and population features
AN  - 2056768591
AB  - The increasingly frequent appearance of invasive species of mussels is a common phenomenon nowadays. Their rapid expansion is a significant component of the global changes that pose a great ecological impact and a serious threat to the diversity of native fauna. This study documents new localities of occurrence of Sinanodonta woodiana in Poland. We also attempted to determine its density, biomass, morphometric features and age structure. We found that its presence is clearly related to temperature and that the current range of its occurrence in Poland mostly overlaps with the areas with the highest average annual temperatures. The study showed significant differences in mean density between the fishponds: on particular sites the density amounted to 9 individuals/m2 and their biomass exceeded 3000 g/m2. ANOVA revealed significant differences in the mean dimensions of the shells between the three fishponds related to their height and width. Seven-year-old individuals were the most numerous while one-, two-, five- and six-year-old specimens were the most numerous in pond 2. In our opinion, S. woodiana has created a permanent population that is probably able to breed. This is confirmed by the appearance of one-year-old individuals as well as the other younger age classes.Alternate abstract:L'apparition de plus en plus fréquente d'espèces envahissantes de moules est un phénomène fréquent. Leur rapide expansion est une composante importante des changements globaux qui causent un fort impact écologique et une grave menace pour la diversité de la faune indigène. Cette étude documente de nouvelles localités d'implantation de Sinanodonta woodiana en Pologne. Nous avons également tenté de déterminer la densité, la biomasse, les caractéristiques morphométriques et la structure d'âge. Nous avons constaté que sa présence est clairement liée à la température et que la gamme actuelle de sa localisation en Pologne recouvre principalement les zones où les températures annuelles moyennes sont les plus élevées. L'étude a montré des différences significatives de la densité moyenne entre les étangs : sur des sites particuliers, la densité est élevée à 9 individus/m2 et la biomasse a dépassé 3000 g/m2. L'ANOVA a révélé des différences significatives dans les dimensions moyennes de hauteur et largeur des coquilles entre trois étangs. Des individus de sept ans étaient les plus nombreux en 1 alors que les spécimens de un, deux, cinq et six ans étaient les plus nombreux dans l'étang 2. À notre avis, S. woodiana a créé une population permanente qui est probablement en mesure de se reproduire. Ceci est confirmé par l'apparition d'individus âgés d'un an ainsi que la présence d'autres classes d'âge jeunes.

T1  - Life in the Nucleus, The Genomic Basis of Energy Exploitation by Intranuclear Microsporidia
AN  - 1937409378
AB  - The Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that have jettisoned oxidation phosphorylative capabilities during their early evolutionary history and so rely on ATP import from their host and glycolysis for their energy needs. Some species form tight associations with the host’s mitochondria and this is thought to facilitate ATP sequestration by the developing intracellular microsporidian. The human parasite, Enterocytozoon bieneusi has however lost glycolytic capabilities and may rely entirely on ATP import from its host for energy. E. bieneusi belongs to the Enterocytozoonidae microsporidian family and recent rDNA-based phylogenetic studies have suggested it has close evolutionary ties with Enterospora canceri, a crab-infecting intranuclear parasite. Such a close evolutionary relationship implied that glycolysis might also be absent in the intranuclear parasite raising questions as to how this parasite obtains energy from its unusual niche that is physically walled off from the host mitochondria, the main source of ATP in the host cell.In this study, draft genomes of four species of the Enterocytozoonidae namely, Ent. canceri, E. hepatopenaei, Hepatospora eriocheir and Hepatospora eriocheir canceri and one non-Enterocytozoonidae species, Thelohania sp. were assembled and annotated (The genome assembly of Hepatospora eriocheir was provided by Dr. Bryony Williams). Phylogenomics performed with this and publicly available genomic data confirmed the close evolutionary ties between Ent. canceri and E. bieneusi. Comparative genomic analyses also revealed that glycolysis is indeed lost in all members of the Enterocytozoonidae family sequenced in this study, hinting to the relaxation of evolutionary pressures to maintain this pathway at the base of this microsporidian family. Despite this absence, the hexokinase gene was retained in all aglycolytic genomes analysed, and that of Ent. canceri was fused to a PTPA gene. Functional assays and yeast complementation assays suggest that this chimera is able to recognise glucose as a substrate but the heterologously expressed homolog of H. eriocheir cannot. Finally, phylogenomics have been used here to demonstrate that despite the morphological differences between three Hepatospora-like organisms parasitizing different crab hosts, they are the same species. This finding adds more weight to current evidence suggesting that morphology is not an ideal marker for taxonomical classification in the Microsporidia.

T1  - Environmental features influence complex behavior in small groups of animals
AN  - 1842659189
AB  - Simple environmental features can shape complex behavior. Identifying key aspects of the environment (e.g., temperature, structure, toxins) that lead to widespread consequences is of central importance in a changing world. The primary objective of my dissertation is to investigate how relatively simple aspects of the environment can influence small groups of animals in profound and complex ways. In the first three chapters, I report on experiments showing how small changes in the environment can affect the expression of behavior at different points in development and can have important physiological consequences for litters of mouse pups. I then report on two sets of experiments showing how subtle changes in the environment can dramatically affect spacing patterns and social dynamics of small groups of adult zebrafish. Together, my results emphasize the ways that subtle changes in the environment can have profound impacts on individuals and small groups. In both lines of work, I have found that a more accurate characterization of the phenomena, infant rodent development and zebrafish social behavior, requires the use of individual and group measures and that temperature, density, and pollutants can have a powerful effect on group responses. These results are important because they show that the physical environment can have profound effects on the phenotype, and that with a changing physical environment or anthropogenic change, dramatic differences may be observed in the behavior of groups.

T1  - Tasteless, cheap, and southern? The rise and decline of the farm-raised catfish industry
AN  - 1784302500
AB  - This dissertation traces the rise and recent decline of the farm-raised catfish industry. From the 1960s to the 2000s, farmers and scientists reengineered the river catfish into an agro-industrial food crop. Through extensive agricultural scientific research and marketing, the farmed catfish industry changed the history of the animal, its image, its flesh and bone, its natural environment, and its place in society all by changing—or in an effort to change—its taste. This process moved the catfish from the ranks of a muddy tasting wild fish mainly associated with the poor, to a tasteless, cheap food consumed by all classes and ethnicities. Former cotton planters dug ponds and raised the fish, as researchers at land-grant universities gave the fish a taste and image makeover. Developing a bland meat and an efficient way to grow it presented only half the problem. Workers, predominately black, poor, and female, slaved away in dank, dangerous processing plants. Some struck, despite labor power’s impotence in a globalizing economy. Amid these labor disputes, competition from Vietnamese catfish imports began to trickle in onto the American seafood market. By the 2000s, the “Catfish Wars” had broken out between Asian importers and American farmers. Processors devised quality control measures that washed away the catfish’s distinctive qualities. They had done their work so well, that consumers could tell no difference between fish from around the globe. The farm-raised catfish embodied a culinary, cultural, and technological transformation. My work shows the importance of sensory experiences to southern culture, foodways, African American history, environmental history, and agricultural history.

T1  - The Story of a Hitchhiker: Population Genetic Patterns in the Invasive Barnacle Balanus(Amphibalanus) improvisus Darwin 1854
AN  - 1761076182
AB  - Understanding the ecological and evolutionary forces that determine the genetic structure and spread of invasive species is a key component of invasion biology. The bay barnacle, Balanus improvisus (= Amphibalanus improvisus), is one of the most successful aquatic invaders worldwide, and is characterised by broad environmental tolerance. Although the species can spread through natural larval dispersal, human-mediated transport through (primarily) shipping has almost certainly contributed to the current global distribution of this species. Despite its worldwide distribution, little is known about the phylogeography of this species. Here, we characterize the population genetic structure and model dispersal dynamics of the barnacle B. improvisus, and describe how human-mediated spreading via shipping as well as natural larval dispersal may have contributed to observed genetic variation. We used both mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I: COI) and nuclear microsatellites to characterize the genetic structure in 14 populations of B. improvisus on a global and regional scale (Baltic Sea). Genetic diversity was high in most populations, and many haplotypes were shared among populations on a global scale, indicating that long-distance dispersal (presumably through shipping and other anthropogenic activities) has played an important role in shaping the population genetic structure of this cosmopolitan species. We could not clearly confirm prior claims that B. improvisus originates from the western margins of the Atlantic coasts; although there were indications that Argentina could be part of a native region. In addition to dispersal via shipping, we show that natural larval dispersal may play an important role for further colonisation following initial introduction.

T1  - Fine-Scale Ecological and Genetic Population Structure of Two Whitefish (Coregoninae) Species in the Vicinity of Industrial Thermal Emissions
AN  - 1760027179
AB  - Thermal pollution from industrial processes can have negative impacts on the spawning and development of cold-water fish. Point sources of thermal effluent may need to be managed to avoid affecting discrete populations. Correspondingly, we examined fine-scale ecological and genetic population structure of two whitefish species (Coregonus clupeaformis and Prosopium cylindraceum) on Lake Huron, Canada, in the immediate vicinity of thermal effluent from nuclear power generation. Niche metrics using δ13C and δ15N stable isotopes showed high levels of overlap (48.6 to 94.5%) in resource use by adult fish captured in areas affected by thermal effluent compared to nearby reference locations. Isotopic niche size, a metric of resource use diversity, was 1.3- to 2.8-fold higher than reference values in some thermally affected areas, indicative of fish mixing. Microsatellite analyses of genetic population structure (Fst, STRUCTURE and DAPC) indicated that fish captured at all locations in the vicinity of the power plant were part of a larger population extending beyond the study area. In concert, ecological and genetic markers do not support the presence of an evolutionarily significant unit in the vicinity of the power plant. Thus, future research should focus on the potential impacts of thermal emissions on development and recruitment.

T1  - Feeding activity and diet composition of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814) in the coastal waters of SE Baltic Sea
AN  - 2811717487
AB  - Feeding activity and diet composition of round goby were investigated in the south-eastern Baltic Sea, the Lithuanian coastal waters during May-October 2012 in order to determine main feeding objects and seasonal periods when native fauna could be most affected by predation of this highly invasive species. In total, prey represented by 18 taxa was found in the gut contents of dissected fish. Feeding activity of round goby varied depending on the body size, sex and stage of the reproduction period. The gut contents of < 50 mm specimens were dominated by zooplanktonic and meiobenthic organisms, whereas larger individuals (50–99 mm) shifted to amphipods and mollusks. Individuals of the intermediate 100-200 mm length had a variable diet, changing depending on the season; in spring they mostly preyed on Macoma balthica, in summer − on polychaetes, while in autumn the contribution of Mytilus trossulus and fish considerably increased in their diet. Diet composition of individuals ≥ 200 mm was relatively constant in the course of the study with substantial preference to M. balthica. These findings imply that benthic fauna, particularly a newly settled generation of epibenthic mollusks in autumn is under strong predatory pressure of the round goby.

T1  - Feeding activity and diet composition of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814) in the coastal waters of SE Baltic Sea
AN  - 1861422411
AB  - Feeding activity and diet composition of round goby were investigated in the south-eastern Baltic Sea, the Lithuanian coastal waters during May-October 2012 in order to determine main feeding objects and seasonal periods when native fauna could be most affected by predation of this highly invasive species. In total, prey represented by 18 taxa was found in the gut contents of dissected fish. Feeding activity of round goby varied depending on the body size, sex and stage of the reproduction period. The gut contents of < 50 mm specimens were dominated by zooplanktonic and meiobenthic organisms, whereas larger individuals (50-99 mm) shifted to amphipods and mollusks. Individuals of the intermediate 100-200 mm length had a variable diet, changing depending on the season; in spring they mostly preyed on Macoma balthica, in summer - on polychaetes, while in autumn the contribution of Mytilus trossulus and fish considerably increased in their diet. Diet composition of individuals ≥ 200 mm was relatively constant in the course of the study with substantial preference to M. balthica. These findings imply that benthic fauna, particularly a newly settled generation of epibenthic mollusks in autumn is under strong predatory pressure of the round goby.

T1  - Success in Competition for Space in Two Invasive Coral Species in the western Atlantic – Tubastraea micranthus and T. coccinea
AN  - 1750199191
AB  - Invasion success by an alien species is dependent upon rate of reproduction, growth, mortality, physical characteristics of the environment, and successful competition for resources with native species. For sessile, epibenthic marine species, one critical resource is space. We examined competitive success in two invasive Indo-Pacific corals involved in competition for space in the northern Gulf of Mexico—Tubastraea coccinea and T. micranthus—on up to 13 offshore oil/gas platforms south of the Mississippi River. Still-capture photos of thousands of overgrowth interactions between the target corals and other sessile epibenthic fauna were analyzed from ROV videos collected at 8–183 m depth. T. micranthus was observed overgrowing >90% of all sessile epibenthic species which it encountered. Frequencies of competitive success varied significantly between platforms. T. coccinea was competitively superior to all competitors pooled, at the 60% level. There was little variability between T. coccinea populations. T. coccinea encountered the following species most frequently—the encrusting sponges Xestospongia sp. (with the commensal Parazoanthus catenularis), X. carbonaria, Dictyonella funicularis, Mycale carmigropila, Phorbas amaranthus, and Haliclona vansoesti—and was found to be, on average, competitively superior to them. Both T. micranthus and T. coccinea appear to be good competitors for space against these species in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Competitive success in T. micranthus was highest in the NE part of the study area, and lowest in the SW area near the Mississippi River plume. T. coccinea’s competitive success peaked in the SW study area. This suggests that variation in competitive success both within and between populations of these species may be due to differences in local environmental factors.

T1  - Understanding Acceptable Level of Risk: Incorporating the Economic Cost of Under-Managing Invasive Species
AN  - 1730269961
AB  - Management of nonindigenous species includes prevention, early detection and rapid response and control. Early detection and rapid response depend on prioritizing and monitoring sites at risk for arrival or secondary spread of nonindigenous species. Such monitoring efforts require sufficient biosecurity budgets to be effective and meet management or policy directives for reduced risk of introduction. Such consideration of risk reduction is rarely considered, however. Here, we review the concepts of acceptable level of risk (ALOR) and associated costs with respect to nonindigenous species and present a framework for aligning risk reduction priorities with available biosecurity resources. We conclude that available biosecurity resources may be insufficient to attain stated and desired risk reduction. This outcome highlights the need to consider policy and management directives when beginning a biosecurity program to determine the feasibility of risk reduction goals, given available resources.

AB  - "There's a number of interactions at play, and we can't always predict those things," he added.              "This government has completely and utterly dropped the ball when it comes to zebra mussels," the party's Conservation critic, Shannon Martin, said Friday.              "These mussels have been in the Great Lakes for 25 years. Those lakes are not dead. People still use them," she said. People are still swimming, boating, using the beaches there. They're drawing their drinking water from those lakes. So I think we need to remain optimistic."

T1  - Structure and density population of the invasive mollusc Limnoperna fortunei associated with Eichhornia crassipes in lakes of the Middle Paraná floodplain
AN  - 2417701833
AB  - The roots of Eichhornia crassipes provide different microhabitats for invertebrates, including substrate for the Asian invasive bivalve Limnoperna fortunei. This work evaluated the density and size structure of L. fortunei on the roots of E. crassipes in lentic waterbodies associated with the Middle Paraná floodplain. The field work was carried out between November 2009–2010, covering different phases of the hydrological regime. Floating meadows of E. crassipes were sampled monthly in two lakes with different degrees of connection to the main channel of the Paraná River. Bivalve densities were not associated with variations of the biomass of E. crassipes roots and the highest mussel densities were recorded during months of high temperature. The maximum size recorded in both lakes corresponded to individuals approximately 2.5 years old; however, up to 75% of the molluscs were represented by pre-reproductive individuals (up to 6 months old). In these lakes with soft bottom and limited hard substrates, E. crassipes is an important site for the mussel attachment during its early stages of development and could not be the final site of settlement during its lifecycle.

T1  - Ecological restoration for river ecosystems: comparing the huangpu river in shanghai and the hudson river in new york
AN  - 2287990581
AB  - Starting in the 1960s, a great deal of effort and capital was invested in an endeavor to significantly improve the quality of surface water around the United States, particularly in metropolises like New York City, New York. The Hudson River has been at the forefront of these efforts and has benefited immensely from this campaign. In parts of the developing world, such as China, similar efforts are beginning to gather the same type of momentum. Within the past decade, the Huangpu River, which flows through Shanghai into the Yangtze Estuary of China, has been a target for ecological restoration and management. It is possible to draw parallels between the cleanup efforts involved in improving the environmental conditions of the Huangpu and Hudson Rivers. Using the methodologies of series comparison (SCM), water quality index (WQI) modeling, consideration of ecological engineering, and policy strategy design, we comparatively studied the topography, functions, environmental conditions, ecological engineering countermeasures, and management policies of the two rivers to assist future forecasting of ecological restoration efforts in China.

T1  - Hydroxide stabilization as a new tool for ballast disinfection: efficacy of treatment on zooplankton
AN  - 2287044713
AB  - Effective and economical tools are needed for treating ship ballast to meet new regulatory requirements designed to reduce the introduction of invasive aquatic species from ship traffic. We tested the efficacy of hydroxide stabilization as a ballast disinfection tool in replicated, sequential field trials on board the M/V Ranger III in waters of Lake Superior. Ballast water was introduced into each of four identical 1,320 L stainless steel tanks during a simulated ballasting operation. Two tanks were treated with NaOH to elevate the pH to 11.7 and the remaining two tanks were held as controls without pH alteration. After retention on board for 14–18 h, CO2-rich gas recovered from one of two diesel propulsion engines was sparged into tanks treated with NaOH for 2 h to force conversion of NaOH ultimately to sodium bicarbonate, thereby lowering pH to about 7.1. Prior to gas sparging, the engine exhaust was treated by a unique catalytic converter/wet scrubber process train to remove unwanted combustion byproducts and to provide cooling. The contents of each tank were then drained and filtered through 35-µm mesh plankton nets to collect all zooplankton. The composition and relative survival of zooplankton in each tank were evaluated by microscopy. Zooplankton populations were dominated by rotifers, but copepods and cladocerans were observed. Hydroxide stabilization was 100% effective in killing all zooplankton present at the start of the tests. Our results suggest hydroxide stabilization has potential to be an effective and practical tool to disinfect ship ballast. Further, using CO2 released from the ship engine reduces emissions and the neutralized by product, sodium bicarbonate, can have beneficial impacts on the aquatic environment.

T1  - Fauna Europaea: Mollusca – Bivalvia
AN  - 2170336852
AB  - Fauna Europaeaprovides a public web-service with an index of scientific names (including important synonyms) of all living European land and freshwater animals, their geographical distribution at country level (up to the Urals, excluding the Caucasus region), and some additional information. The Fauna Europaea project covers about 230, 000 taxonomic names, including 130, 000 accepted species and 14, 000 accepted subspecies, which is much more than the originally projected number of 100, 000 species. This represents a huge effort by more than 400 contributing specialists throughout Europe and is a unique (standard) reference suitable for many users in science, government, industry, nature conservation and education. For the Mollusca - Bivalvia, data from 5 families ( Margaritiferidae, Unionidae, Sphaeriidae, Cyrenidae, Dreissenidae ) containing 55 species are included in this paper. European freshwater bivalves belong to the Orders Unionoida and Cardiida. All the European unionoids are included in the superfamily Unionoidea, the freshwater mussels or naiads. The European cardiids belong to the following three superfamilies: Cardioidea, Cyrenoidea and Dreissenoidea. Among the Unionoidea there are the most imperilled animal groups on the planet while the Cardioidea includes the cosmopolitan genus  Pisidium , the Cyrenoidea the Asiatic clam ( Corbicula fluminea  ) and the Dreissenoidea the famous invasive zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha  ). Basic information is summarized on their taxonomy and biology. Tabulations include a complete list of the current estimated families, genera and species.

T1  - Integrating microorganism and macroorganism dispersal: modes, techniques and challenges with particular focus on co-dispersal
AN  - 1806207052
AB  - Whatever their size and the ecosystem they live in, all organisms may disperse at some stage of their life cycle. Dispersal dynamics are to a varying extent dependent on organismal size, life history, ecological niche, survival capacities and phylogeny. Moves towards a synthesis in dispersal ecology have focused primarily on vertebrates and higher plants, yet recent studies suggest that the dispersal of microorganisms and macroorganisms has much more in common than previously assumed. The dispersal of one organism enables co-dispersal for many others, smaller in size. There is an increasing need for a more integrated approach to study dispersal within the context of organismal interactions and their environments. Such an approach is facilitated by recent developments of powerful indirect techniques that enable tracking of microorganisms and macroorganisms over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Likewise, dispersal modelling and theoretical models of the consequences of dispersal can inspire empirical studies across the entire size spectrum. Simultaneously studying the relationships between dispersal of microorganisms and macroorganisms, and accounting for dispersal through time and space, will allow us to better understand the functioning and dynamics of communities and ecosystems, and to make better predictions of future dispersal patterns, changes in biodiversity and connectivity.

T1  - Altered energy flow in the food web of an experimentally darkened lake
AN  - 2300649699
AB  - Theory suggests that alternative resources may begin to support a food web when highly used resources become less available relative to alternatives. To test the potential for alternative resources to support consumers, we experimentally darkened a lake whose consumers had relied heavily on algal resources (phytoplankton and benthic algae). We estimated the support consumers received from resources before and after darkening using a Bayesian mixing model and stables isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Between a prior year and the darkened year, phytoplankton biomass diminished by 60%, and surface dissolved oxygen saturation, pCO2, and net ecosystem production indicated a shift from autotrophy to heterotrophy. Although a specialist copepod maintained a high reliance on phytoplankton after darkening, a generalist zooplankton predator (Chaoborus spp.) derived more support from terrestrial sources. Fishes received less support from benthic algae after darkening, and received greater support from floating‐leafed macrophytes or terrestrial resources. Phytoplankton support of fishes increased or was similar between years, resulting in a convergence of the proportion of support that fishes and zooplankton received from phytoplankton. The changes in algal support of fishes suggest that fishes had an increased connection to the pelagic habitat and decreased connection to the benthic habitat after darkening. After darkening, most consumers received more support from resource alternatives like terrestrial material (snail, Chaoborus spp., some fishes) or from floating‐leafed macrophytes (some fishes). These shifts indicate that resource support of consumers is dynamic, and highlight the potential for increased support of consumer biomass by alternative resources.

T1  - Drought‐induced changes in flow regimes lead to long‐term losses in mussel‐provided ecosystem services
AN  - 2290257608
AB  - Extreme hydro‐meteorological events such as droughts are becoming more frequent, intense, and persistent. This is particularly true in the south central USA, where rapidly growing urban areas are running out of water and human‐engineered water storage and management are leading to broad‐scale changes in flow regimes. The Kiamichi River in southeastern Oklahoma, USA, has high fish and freshwater mussel biodiversity. However, water from this rural river is desired by multiple urban areas and other entities. Freshwater mussels are large, long‐lived filter feeders that provide important ecosystem services. We ask how observed changes in mussel biomass and community composition resulting from drought‐induced changes in flow regimes might lead to changes in river ecosystem services. We sampled mussel communities in this river over a 20‐year period that included two severe droughts. We then used laboratory‐derived physiological rates and river‐wide estimates of species‐specific mussel biomass to estimate three aggregate ecosystem services provided by mussels over this time period: biofiltration, nutrient recycling (nitrogen and phosphorus), and nutrient storage (nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon). Mussel populations declined over 60%, and declines were directly linked to drought‐induced changes in flow regimes. All ecosystem services declined over time and mirrored biomass losses. Mussel declines were exacerbated by human water management, which has increased the magnitude and frequency of hydrologic drought in downstream reaches of the river. Freshwater mussels are globally imperiled and declining around the world. Summed across multiple streams and rivers, mussel losses similar to those we document here could have considerable consequences for downstream water quality although lost biofiltration and nutrient retention. While we cannot control the frequency and severity of climatological droughts, water releases from reservoirs could be used to augment stream flows and prevent compounded anthropogenic stressors.

T1  - Freshwater bivalves rearing: a brief overview
AN  - 1677311762
AB  - Freshwater bivalves farming is principally focused on freshwater pearl production in Asia and conservation aquaculture in USA while in Europe is almost completely unknown. High larval mortality is considered the bottleneck in freshwater bivalve larval rearing and methods currently used in marine bivalve larval rearing can be transferred in freshwater mussels. It is likely that probiotics and aquatic microbiology will play a key role also in freshwater bivalves larval rearing. Alternative applications of freshwater mussel rearing should be studied in deep in the future as integrated productions, bioindication projects and utilization of freshwater mussel meal as potential source for fish feeds. The aim of this review is to give a description of potential applications for freshwater bivalve rearing and possible future perspectives.

T1  - Robust and Optimal Control for Disturbed Population Dynamics
AN  - 2838333318
AB  - We use control theory to explore management of populations affected by disturbances and uncertainty. We consider five related topics. Chapter 2 uses linear programming to find optimal translocation strategies between wild and captive populations. To allow comparison of the solutions we classify the optimal strategy depending on which stage classes are kept in captivity. We find depending on species, that different stages are targeted when the resource available is limited. In Chapter 3 we use linear programming to create management strategies for an invading population affected by disturbance. For a sinusoidal disturbance, the final population with control is bounded between a transfer function approximation and a feedback control solution. Then we assume worst case disturbance, which creates a 2-player game. In this linear programming context, minimax≥maximin. Chapter 4 considers a 2-player linear-quadratic problem and introduces the use of disturbance attenuation into ecology. Disturbance attenuation shows how a disturbance is amplified or attenuated by the system. In Chapter 5 we consider an invading population, and we explore the effect that stochasticity has on the relationship between Allee effect and population inertia needed for successful invasion. We find that for small population densities, then demographic stochasticity dramatically reduces the likelihood of invasion and survival of the resident.

T1  - Deliberation and Implementation of the Breaux Act
AN  - 1762158006
AB  - This thesis traces the coastal restoration movement in Louisiana from the early identification of coastal land loss by scientists to the introduction of proactive legislation by politicians like Senator John Breaux. Serving to highlight the transcendence of Louisiana’s problem from a local issue to one of national significance, the focal point of this work is the 1990 federal Coastal Wetlands Planning, Protection, and Restoration Act or “Breaux Act.” The restoration of Louisiana’s wetlands arose from an emphasis on their economic importance purported by grassroots groups like the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana, as well as state and federal politicians. Due to the atypical nature of this disaster, meaning its difference from typical disasters that are readily apparent and fast acting, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes, the movement to properly address it was rather convoluted and never quite resulted in complete success.

T1  - Models for the Interaction of Structured Populations and the Environment
AN  - 1760608626
AB  - Chapter 1 of this thesis describes the historical development and application of size-structured models and their role in modeling the population dynamics of biological systems. Chapter 2 presents a general model for the interaction of a size-structured population with its environment. The vital rates of the individuals are assumed to depend on a number of variables including the total population and the environment. A nonstandard finite difference approximation is developed for the general model and the convergence of the scheme to the unique weak solution of the nonlinear system of partial differential equations coupled with ordinary differential equations is established. Potential applications are presented in various fields ranging from shared resource dynamics to invasive species. Chapter 3 presents a first order finite difference scheme for phytoplankton dynamics subject to a vector of environmental variables in a well-mixed reactor. The biophysical problem yields a nonlinear partial differential equation coupled with a general system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which represent the time-varying environmental conditions in the water column. Convergence results are established for the coupled system using the finite difference method. Numerical trials are presented to illustrate the performance of the model against a real dataset. Taking into account the combined effects of aggregate growth and coagulation, the model is used to investigate the role of the active fraction of the cell aggregate on algal bloom dynamics and nutrient consumption rates. The model is well-suited to complement microcosm studies and can accommodate the effects of a wide range of environmental conditions. Chapter 4 summarizes the main results, research and practical challenges associated with the application of general size-structured models, and suggestions for future work.

T1  - Iodine-131: Measurement and application of a novel tracer in Lake Michigan
AN  - 1757808214
AB  - Iodine-131 is a short-lived (half-life=8.0233 days), gamma emitting, radiopharmaceutical that, when excreted by patients, enters aquatic systems via sewage effluent discharged from water reclamation facilities (WRFs). Here, I report on 131I activities in the nearshore of southwest Lake Michigan in the vicinity of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This is the first report on 131I activity in any of the Great Lakes of North America.    The flux of 131I from Milwaukee’s two WRFs was monitored from July 2013 to December 2014. Mean discharge of 131I from the Jones Island WRF was (0.664 ± 0.012)×108 Bq d-1 (mean effluent 131I activity: ~0.25 Bq L -1; n = 29). Mean discharge of 131I from the South Shore WRF was (2.07 ± 0.68)×108 Bq d-1  (mean effluent 131I activity: ~0.74 Bq L-1 ; n = 29). The mean combined flux of 131I from both WRFs into Lake Michigan was (2.78 ± 0.72)×108 Bq d-1.   Measureable activities of 131I were found in samples of  Cladophora algae that were collected along a ~40 km section of Lake Michigan shoreline, from Atwater Park (8 km north of the Jones Island WRF) to Wind Point (13 km south of the South Shore WRF). 131I activity in all Cladophora algae samples (n = 30) ranged from below detection to ~39 Bq g-1 dry weight. Cladophora samples containing 131I were found at the shoreline of most public beaches in the area including Atwater Park, Bradford Beach, South Shore Beach, Bay View Park, Grant Park, and Bender Park. Detection of 131 I in algae still attached to bottom substrate is an unequivocal metric of recent (days to weeks) exposure to treated sewage effluent. 131 I activity in dreissenid mussels (n = 17) ranged from below detection to ~0.7 Bq g-1 dry weight, and its mean was approximately one order of magnitude less than activity found in Cladophora algae.   Bottom trawls of lakebed material were made at 1, 5, and 8 km from shore in the vicinities of both WRFs. Analysis of collected materials revealed most  131I activity in sloughed Cladophora algae, with overall 131I activity decreasing with distance from shore but still measureable at 8 km out. Under steady state conditions, estimates of sloughed Cladophora transport along the lake bottom ranged from 200 to 500 m d-1 in both the south and east (offshore) directions.   Estimates of sediment deposition in the Milwaukee outer harbor were made with measurements of 131I and the naturally occurring cosmogenic radionuclide 7Be (half-life = 53.44 days) in bottom sediment (n = 67) and the outer harbor water column (dissolved + particle-bound fractions; n = 21). Concordance between both radionuclide derived particle flux estimates could only be achieved if it was assumed that bottom scavenging of both particle-bound and dissolved nuclide fractions was occurring, with particle transport dominated by vertical convection rather than gravitational settling. Mean non-steady state estimates of sediment deposition in the outer harbor from 29 July to 8 October, 2014 were 5.48 ± 0.93 tonne d-1 as derived by 131I, and 7.6 ± 1.3 tonne d-1 as derived by 7Be. Estimates of sediment loading from the Milwaukee River to the outer harbor, which were derived from USGS gauged discharge and turbidity measurements, had a mean of 9.1 tonne d-1 over the same time interval. I conclude from these results that as much as 60 to 80% of riverine particulate material delivered to the outer harbor is retained within the harbor and not discharged to the lake during periods of relatively low river flow.

T1  - Distribution and impact of the alien anemone Sagartia ornata in the West Coast National Park
AN  - 1737492936
AB  - Sagartia ornata is an alien anemone that occurs intertidally within the West Coast National Park (WCNP). The present study aimed to determine the current status and distribution of this anemone, to assess its diet so as to establish the role it may play as predator and to investigate its impact on sandy-shore communities. Sagartia ornata was found to be restricted to the WCNP, where it occurred in densities of up to 508 ± 218 individuals per m^sup 2^. Populations were recorded in Nanozostera capensis seagrass beds for the first time and this alien was absent from two areas in which it had previously occurred. It is concluded that whilst this anemone negatively affects native biota, its current dependence on restricted habitats precludes widespread impacts with the park. With regard to conservation implications, this invasion should be routinely monitored outside the WCNP as in its native range S. ornata occurs on rocky shores and kelp holdfasts, suggesting a potential for spread along the west coast of South Africa.

T1  - An Objective Method to Quantify the Location Criterion used to Classify Species at Risk in Canada
AN  - 1726896505
AB  - Location is an indicator often used in the conservation assessments of species by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). The guidelines on the definition and calculation of location have received criticism for their ambiguity. To examine the application of location, I summarized the use of locations in COSEWIC assessment reports for 86 Canadian freshwater taxa. I propose an alternative method for calculating location using a standardized geographic buffer. Simulations to test the applicability of the buffer were conducted in ArcGIS using distribution data, scale of the primary threat, and minimum area for viable population for 20 imperiled freshwater fish species of southern Ontario. The shape of the buffer is dependent on the species habitat and the primary threat to the species. My proposed objective method of calculating location will contribute to more accurate conservation assessments of species, and subsequent development and implementation of conservation strategies.

T1  - Analysis of ground vibrations produced by an 80 in3  water gun in the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal, Lemont, Illinois
AN  - 1722054858
AB  - Since its completion in 1910, the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (CSSC) has become a pathway for invasive species (and potentially Asian carp) to reach the Great Lakes.  Currently, an electric barrier is used to prevent Asian carp migration through the canal, but the need for a secondary method is necessary, especially when the electric barrier undergoes maintenance.  The underwater Asian carp “cannon” (water gun) provides such a method.  Analysis of the ground movement produced by an 80 in3 water gun in the CSSC was performed in order to establish any potential for damage to the either the canal or structures built along the canal.  Ground movement was collected using 3-component geophones on both the land surface and in boreholes.  The peak particle velocities (PPVs) were analyzed to determine if damage would be caused to structures located along the canal.  Vector sum velocity ground movement along the canal wall was as high as 0.28 in/s (7.11 mm/s), which is much lower than the United States Bureau of Mines (USBM) ground vibration damage threshold of 0.75 in/s (19.1 mm/s), causing no potential for damage to structures along the canal wall.  The dominant frequency of ground motion produced by the water gun is primarily above 40 Hz, so the wave energy should attenuate fairly quickly away from the canal wall, with little disturbance to structures further from the wall.

T1  - Localized Ecological and Educational Effects of Environmental Service-Learning in Portland, Oregon
AN  - 1707357423
AB  - Environmental service-learning is an intentional educational experience(s) wherein learners engage in meaningful activities designed to serve the environment. Environmental service-learning activities vary according to their learning and service goals and include ecomanagement, persuasion, legal action, economic action and political action. The purpose of this mixed methods research was to explore the ecological and educational impacts of grades 6-12 environmental education, with special attention to environmental service-learning throughout Portland, Oregon.   Ecological impacts considered restoration and conservation outcomes of several environmental service-learning programs including plant communities, soils, litter removal and trail maintenance. Educational outcomes considered aspects of environmental literacy including locus of control, environmental sensitivity, indicated environmentally responsible behaviors, investigating environmental issues and knowledge of physical systems. The relative influence of some significant life experiences on youths' response to environmental education, including environmental service-learning, was also considered. Telephone surveys were used to gather data from 22 Portland metropolitan area environmental education programs. Data included 2014 annual biophysical impacts (e.g., area of invasive species removed, pounds of litter removed) and information on programming (e.g., length of program, % time outside). Eleven programs administered a 33-question environmental literacy assessment to participants of their programs (n=393). The assessment included the New Environmental Paradigm, the Inclusion of Nature in Self, questions from Environmental Identity Scale and self-constructed questions. One 8th grade program was identified for a detailed case study. In this 8th grade programs, slight variations in educational activities occurred among three treatment groups which varied the amount of time youth spent engaged in ecomanagement. Youth from the three treatment groups and a control group were administered the environmental literacy assessment at the beginning and end of the program. Qualitative data for the youth in the treatment groups were gathered to further consider how environmental literacy was impacted by participation in the program.    Stronger associational correlations to environmental literacy occurred for the percentage of time an environmental education program spent outdoors rather than the percentage of time an environmental education program engaged in environmental service-learning (e.g., “With other people, I can work to make a positive impact on the environment.” rho: .276 vs. “I have the skills necessary to make a positive impact on the environment.” rho: .176). Random forests indicated that environmental education program features and some significant life experiences could predict collapsed environmental literacy variables (locus of control, environmental sensitivity and environmentally responsible behaviors). 22.4% of the variance in a collapsed environmental sensitivity variable was explained by nine predictor variables; those variables with the strongest influence were youth response to “Before this program, how frequently did you spend time in the outdoors”, age and the presence of a positive adult role model who cares for the environment. Youth participating in environmental education programs showed higher environmental literacy than control groups (e.g., “I feel an important part of my life would be missing if I couldn't get out and enjoy nature from time to time” U: 3642.500, p: 0.025). Youth with significant formative life experiences (e.g., those indicating previous environmental education or a positive adult role model that cares for the environment) responded better (higher environmental literacy) to environmental education than those youth without (“I pay special attention to things outdoors.” chi 10.633, p: 0.031).   This research provides insight on the efficacy of environmental service-learning. Environmental service-learning positively affected environmental literacy, but outdoor environmental education was more effective in terms of environmental literacy. Results corroborate the body of literature regarding significant life experiences. Further, results suggest that significant life experiences are a critical development milestone necessary for youth to respond to environmental education on a developmental trajectory to empowered environmentally literate citizens.

AN  - 2133948346
AB  - In its first English-language edition, this book introduces the many-faceted interactions of animal populations with their habitats. From soil fauna, ants and termites to small and large herbivores, burrowing mammals and birds, the author presents a comprehensive analysis of animals and ecosystems that is as broad and varied as all nature. 
Chapter 2 addresses the functional role of animals in landscape ecosystems, emphasizing fluxes of energy and matter within and between ecosystems, and the effects of animals on qualitative and structural habitat change. Discussion includes chapters on the role of animal population density and the impacts of native herbivores on vegetation and habitats from the tropics to the polar regions. Cyclic mass outbreaks of species such as the larch bud moth in Switzerland, the mountain pine beetle and the African red-billed weaver bird are described and analyzed. Other chapters discuss Zoochory - the dispersal of seeds by ants, mammals and birds - and the influence of burrowing animals on soil development and geomorphology. Consideration extends to the impact of feral domestic animals. 
Chapter 5 focuses on problems resulting from introduction of alien animals and from re-introduction of animal species to their original habitats, discusses the effects on ecosystems of burrowing, digging and trampling by animals. The author also addresses keystone species such as kangaroo rats, termites and beavers. 
Chapter 6 addresses the role of animals in landscape management and nature conservation, with chapters on the impact of newcomer species such as animals introduced into Australia, New Zealand and Europe, and the consequences of reintroduction of species to original habitat. It also discusses the carrying capacity of natural habit, public attitudes toward conversation and more. 
The final section ponders the effects of climate on interactions between animals and their habitats.Addresses the functional role of animals in landscape ecosystems and the practical implications for landscape management and nature conservation Assesses the role of animals with special regard to the specific local socio-cultural and economic conditions Includes a section on climate change effects on animal-habitat interactions Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras

T1  - An assessment of angler education and bait trade regulations to prevent invasive species introductions in the Laurentian Great Lakes
AN  - 2287017784
AB  - The commercial bait trade is one pathway for aquatic invasive species (AIS) introductions, as non-target bait species can be accidentally sold to anglers who either inadvertently or intentionally release them while fishing or as excess bait. Prevention of AIS introductions via the bait trade requires a two-tiered management approach, which includes both regulation of the bait industry and angler education. Retail bait shops may offer opportunities for public education regarding AIS, however it is unknown how often shops are targeted for such purposes and how viable this method of angler education is on a temporal scale. The goals of this research were to 1) quantify the current distribution of AIS signage in retail bait shops in the Great Lakes region and 2) estimate the long term viability of using retail bait shops as platform for angler education. Additionally, we present an up-to-date summary of bait industry regulations across the Great Lakes jurisdictions. Of the 525 bait shops visited in 2012 and 2013, 22% displayed some form of AIS educational materials or signage. Additional signs were distributed during initial visits and, during revisits after one calendar year, 54% of shops still displayed the provided signage. The presented summary of bait regulations for Great Lakes jurisdictions indicates multiple discrepancies across the region, which may hinder successful management strategies. Future management goals should consider additional methods of angler education and coordinating regulations across the Great Lakes to improve upon AIS prevention.

T1  - Thorp and Covich's Freshwater Invertebrates:&nbsp;Ecology and General Biology
AN  - 2135835144
AB  - Readers familiar with the first three editions of Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates (edited by J.H. Thorp and A.P. Covich) will welcome the comprehensive revision and expansion of the trusted professional reference manual and educational textbook, from a single North American tome into a developing multi-volume series covering inland water invertebrates of the world. The series entitled Thorp and Covich's Freshwater Invertebrates (edited by J.H. Thorp) begins with the current Volume I: Ecology and General Biology (edited by J.H. Thorp and D.C. Rogers), which is designed as a companion volume for the remaining books in the series. Those following volumes provide taxonomic coverage for specific zoogeographic regions of the world, starting with Keys to Nearctic Fauna (Vol. II) and Keys to Palaearctic Fauna (Vol. III). Volume I maintains the ecological and general biological focus of the previous editions but now expands coverage globally in all chapters, includes more taxonomic groups (e.g., chapters on individual insect orders), and covers additional functional topics such as invasive species, economic impacts, and functional ecology. As in previous editions, the 4th edition of Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates is designed for use by professionals in universities, government agencies, and private companies as well as by undergraduate and graduate students. 
Key Features of Volume I: . Global coverage of aquatic invertebrate ecology. . Discussions on invertebrate ecology, phylogeny, and general biology written by international experts for each group. . Separate chapters on invasive species and economic impacts and uses of invertebrates. 
New to this Series Edition . Eight additional chapters on insect orders and a chapter on freshwater millipedes. . Four new chapters on collecting and culturing techniques, ecology of invasive species, economic impacts, and ecological function of invertebrates. . Overall expansion of ecology and general biology and a shift of the even more detailed taxonomic keys to other volumes in the projected multi-volume series. . Identification keys to lower taxonomic levels. 
Also from Elsevier J.H. Thorp & D.C. Rogers. 2010. Field Guide to Freshwater Invertebrates of North America. ISBN: 978-0-12-381426-5 The Field Guide to Freshwater Invertebrates of North America focuses on freshwater invertebrates that can be identified using at most an inexpensive magnifying glass. Consequently, the taxonomic level and overall biological coverage are not as detailed as in Thorp and Covich's Freshwater Invertebrates. This Guide is useful for experienced and amateur nature enthusiasts, college and high school students conducting class projects or going on field trips, and anglers looking for the best fish bait, lure, or fly.The only up-to-date reference work for covering the ecology, classification, and identification of freshwater aquatic invertebrates of the world.Dr. James H. Thorp has been a Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Kansas (Lawrence, KS, USA) and a Senior Scientist in the Kansas Biological Survey since 2001. Prior to returning to his alma mater, Prof. Thorp was a Distinguished Professor and Dean at Clarkson University, Department Chair and Professor at the University of Louisville, Associate Professor and Director of the Calder Ecology Center of Fordham University, Visiting Associate Professor at Cornell, and Research Ecologist at the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory. He received his Baccalaureate from the University of Kansas (KU) and both Masters and Ph.D. degrees from North Carolina State. Those degrees focused on zoology, ecology, and marine biology, with an emphasis on the ecology of freshwater and marine invertebrates. Dr. Thorp is currently on the editorial board of two journals (River Research and Applications and River Systems) and is a former President of the International Society for River Science. He teaches freshwater, marine, and general ecological courses at KU, and his Masters and doctoral graduate students work on various aspects of the ecology of organisms, communities, and ecosystems in rivers, reservoirs, and wetlands. Prof. Thorp's research interests and background are highly diverse and span the gamut from organismal biology to community, ecosystem, and macrosystem ecology. He works on both fundamental and applied research topics using descriptive, experimental, and modeling approaches in the field and lab. While his research emphasizes aquatic invertebrates, he also studies fish ecology, especially as related to food webs. He has published more than one hundred refereed journal articles, books, and chapters, including three single-volume editions of Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates (edited by J.H. Thorp and A.P. Covich) and the first volume (Ecology and General Biology) in the current fourth edition.
 
 Dr. D. Christopher Rogers is a research zoologist at the University of Kansas with the Kansas Biological Survey and is affiliated with the Biodiversity Institute.

T1  - Reconstructing Local Population Dynamics in Noisy Metapopulations—The Role of Random Catastrophes and Allee Effects
AN  - 1619084926
AB  - Reconstructing the dynamics of populations is complicated by the different types of stochasticity experienced by populations, in particular if some forms of stochasticity introduce bias in parameter estimation in addition to error. Identification of systematic biases is critical when determining whether the intrinsic dynamics of populations are stable or unstable and whether or not populations exhibit an Allee effect, i.e., a minimum size below which deterministic extinction should follow. Using a simulation model that allows for Allee effects and a range of intrinsic dynamics, we investigated how three types of stochasticity—demographic, environmental, and random catastrophes— affect our ability to reconstruct the intrinsic dynamics of populations. Demographic stochasticity aside, which is only problematic in small populations, we find that environmental stochasticity—positive and negative environmental fluctuations—caused increased error in parameter estimation, but bias was rarely problematic, except at the highest levels of noise. Random catastrophes, events causing large-scale mortality and likely to be more common than usually recognized, caused immediate bias in parameter estimates, in particular when Allee effects were large. In the latter case, population stability was predicted when endogenous dynamics were actually unstable and the minimum viable population size was overestimated in populations with small or non-existent Allee effects. Catastrophes also generally increased extinction risk, in particular when endogenous Allee effects were large. We propose a method for identifying data points likely resulting from catastrophic events when such events have not been recorded. Using social spider colonies (Anelosimus spp.) as models for populations, we show that after known or suspected catastrophes are accounted for, reconstructed growth parameters are consistent with intrinsic dynamical instability and substantial Allee effects. Our results are applicable to metapopulation or time series data and are relevant for predicting extinction in conservation applications or the management of invasive species.

T1  - Evaluating efficacy of a ballast water filtration system for reducing spread of aquatic species in freshwater ecosystems
AN  - 2287016107
AB  - Biological invasions by non-indigenous species are considered a leading threat to biodiversity, with prevention being a key management strategy. Consequently, numerous commercial ballast water treatment systems have been, or are being, developed to prevent future aquatic invasions. However, most treatment systems are being designed for the many vessels undertaking long transoceanic voyages in marine waters rather than the relatively few vessels operating on short voyages in freshwater, such as those in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Here we conduct testing of the biological efficacy of a 40 µm ballast water filtration unit through shipboard trials. We test the hypotheses that i) filtration will significantly reduce abundance of zooplankton greater than 50 µm in size but not phytoplankton 10 to 50 µm in size; ii) filtration will reduce zooplankton abundances in ballast water below International Maritime Organization discharge standards, but not those of phytoplankton; and iii) filtration will alter the community composition of zooplankton, non-randomly reducing invasion risk of larger taxa. During the summer of 2012, three shipboard trials were conducted. Ballast water samples were collected using a before-after experimental design. Our study showed that filtration significantly reduced abundance of copepods and cladocerans, but not of juvenile dreissenid veligers and rotifers. Contrary to our expectation, phytoplankton densities were also significantly lower after the treatment. Overall, ballast water treated during our tests would not meet proposed international discharge standards. Filtration altered relative abundance of zooplankton, but did not reduce introduction risk of any taxonomic group due to the small juvenile stages and dormant eggs which passed through the treatment. While we do not rule out filtration as a ballast water treatment option for zooplankton in the future, our tests indicate further development is required for meaningful reduction of invasion risk.

T1  - The distribution of the Asian clam Corbicula fluminea and its potential to spread in Ireland
AN  - 2287016469
AB  - The Asian clam Corbicula fluminea was first recorded from the Barrow River in Ireland in April 2010. There are five separate concentrations known to exist. Four of these were found during 2010 to 2012 within Ireland’s largest river, the Shannon. The abundance and polymodal length frequencies indicate that the likely seminal site in Ireland is from the Barrow where it may have been present since, or before, 2006. There is a concern the species will continue to expand and modify aquatic communities. All concentrations are linked by a connected navigation system thereby implicating leisure craft as a pathway. However, anglers might be spreading the species since most sites where they are now known are associated with angling. This account reviews the evidence for these potential pathways, for this ‘r’ strategist. The abundance and distribution in the lower Shannon River, and possible impacts on lake ecosystems are discussed.

T1  - Small boats provide connectivity for nonindigenous marine species between a highly invaded international port and nearby coastal harbors
AN  - 2287016355
AB  - While considerable variation exists in ecological and economic impacts among nonindigenous species (NIS), the potential magnitude of cumulative impacts for each species increases with increasing area occupied. In the marine environment, large commercial ships have often transferred NIS across ocean basins to new continents. However, following such initial invasions, small craft (recreational and fishing boats) likely play an important role in the secondary, coastwise spread of NIS, thus increasing the geographic range and potential magnitude of impact. In this study, we assess the connectivity among bays in terms of small vessel movement and associated biofouling organisms in central California (USA), examining flux between a heavily invaded international port, San Francisco Bay (SFB), and three small marinas on the adjacent coast. We estimated vessel flux among locations, using data from 405 boater questionnaires and 4,000 transient boat records, and found a strong bi-directional connection between SFB and the nearby coastal marinas. Video surveys of 36 boats that had recently traveled revealed macrofauna on the underwater surfaces on 80% of boats, and at least 27 taxa (including 7 NIS) were present on boats sampled by SCUBA. Importantly, while we provide evidence for strong connectivity, our data most certainly underestimate the flux of vessels and cumulative transfers of organisms among these locations during this short-term study, as vessel movement data are incomplete and surveys are limited even in this small region. This study underscores the opportunities for biofouling organisms, many with limited self-dispersal capacity, to spread via small boats and suggests that effective management strategies to minimize NIS spread and impacts must address the small-boat vector.

T1  - Shading as a Control Method for Invasive European Frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L.)
AN  - 1531469249
AB  - Invasive European frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L.) has negative environmental and economic impacts in North American water bodies. It is therefore important to develop effective management tools to control this invasive species. This study investigated shading as a control method for European frogbit in both greenhouse and lake mesocosm experiments. A series of shade treatments (0%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 100%) were tested in the greenhouse for three weeks. Results showed that the 100% shade was most effective at controlling European frogbit, and other shade treatments greater than 50% were less effective, reducing frogbit biomass up to 38.2%. There were no differences found in temperature between treatments, but dissolved oxygen decreased as shading increased. A lake mesocosm experiment utilizing 0% shade, 70% shade, and 100% shade treatments was performed in a sheltered inlet of Oneida Lake in New York State for over one month. Resulting European frogbit biomass was significantly (25 times) less in areas treated with the 70% shade and nearly zero with the 100% shade. Shading did not affect temperature but improved DO conditions. Results on the shading effects on submerged macrophytes were not conclusive: no significant differences in changes in species richness and abundance between the three groups at the end of studied period suggested no shading effects; significant differences between the beginning and end communities in the 70% shade and the 100% shade but not in the control group indicated significant impacts of shading. This study is the first one to investigate shading as a control method for European frogbit and it is concluded that a moderately high density shade can effective remove European frogbit likely with minor impacts on the environment. More experiments with larger scales and longer time periods are recommended for further investigation.

T1  - Re-examining the relationship between invasive lionfish and native grouper in the Caribbean
AN  - 1958397978
AB  - Biotic resistance is the idea that native species negatively affect the invasion success of introduced species, but whether this can occur at large spatial scales is poorly understood. Here we re-evaluated the hypothesis that native large-bodied grouper and other predators are controlling the abundance of exotic lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) on Caribbean coral reefs. We assessed the relationship between the biomass of lionfish and native predators at 71 reefs in three biogeographic regions while taking into consideration several cofactors that may affect fish abundance, including among others, proxies for fishing pressure and habitat structural complexity. Our results indicate that the abundance of lionfish, large-bodied grouper and other predators were not negatively related. Lionfish abundance was instead controlled by several physical site characteristics, and possibly by culling. Taken together, our results suggest that managers cannot rely on current native grouper populations to control the lionfish invasion.

T1  - Coupling Socioeconomic and Lake Systems for Sustainability: A Conceptual Analysis Using Lake St. Clair Region as a Case Study
AN  - 1504889310; 23949895
AB  - Applying sustainability at an operational level requires understanding the linkages between socioeconomic and natural systems. We identified linkages in a case study of the Lake St. Clair (LSC) region, part of the Laurentian Great Lakes system. Our research phases included: (1) investigating and revising existing coupled human and natural systems frameworks to develop a framework for this case study; (2) testing and refining the framework by hosting a 1-day stakeholder workshop and (3) creating a causal loop diagram (CLD) to illustrate the relationships among the systems' key components. With stakeholder assistance, we identified four interrelated pathways that include water use and discharge, land use, tourism and shipping that impact the ecological condition of LSC. The interrelationships between the pathways of water use and tourism are further illustrated by a CLD with several feedback loops. We suggest that this holistic approach can be applied to other case studies and inspire the development of dynamic models capable of informing decision making for sustainability.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Extinction Resilience of Island Species: An Amphibian Case and a Predictive Model
AN  - 1524241035
AB  - Extreme overall divergence and high extinction rates are typical of insular endemics. Thus, detecting and understanding nativeness is critical on islands. Resilience to extinction is explored through a mechanistic approach focusing on midwife toads (Anura: Alytidae: Alytinae), an ancient lineage that includes continental and insular species. All alytines need urgent conservation action, including control of emerging diseases and spatially explicit reserve design aimed at ensuring ecosystem health and connectivity. The only extant insular alytine is additionally affected by an introduced continental predator. This alien species acts as a driver of the prey's near-extinction and has not elicited any evolutionary response. Both IUCN criteria and EDGE scores show that alytines are top conservation priorities. However, there is a need for also considering phenotypic and ecological uniqueness in the assessment of conservation status and urgency. The reason is that phenotypes render ecosystems functional and insular ones uniquely so. In contrast, phylogenetic relatedness is just a constraint upon, not a motor of, evolutionary novelty. Insular species are indeed particularly susceptible, but can be similarly endangered as continental ones. This paradox may be solved by recognizing the insularity syndrome in any isolated or nearly-insular ecosystem, as a function of evolutionary and dispersal potentials. This predictive model may be useful for island biogeography, invasion biology and conservation planning.

T1  - Transcriptomic Profiling of Differential Responses to Drought in Two Freshwater Mussel Species, the Giant Floater Pyganodon grandis and the Pondhorn Uniomerus tetralasmus
AN  - 1977558159
AB  - The southeastern US has experienced recurrent drought during recent decades. Increasing demand for water, as precipitation decreases, exacerbates stress on the aquatic biota of the Southeast: a global hotspot for freshwater mussel, crayfish, and fish diversity. Freshwater unionid mussels are ideal candidates to study linkages between ecophysiological and behavioral responses to drought. Previous work on co-occurring mussel species suggests a coupling of physiology and behavior along a gradient ranging from intolerant species such as Pyganodon grandis (giant floater) that track receding waters and rarely burrow in the substrates to tolerant species such as Uniomerus tetralasmus (pondhorn) that rarely track receding waters, but readily burrow into the drying sediments. We utilized a next-generation sequencing-based RNA-Seq approach to examine heat/desiccation-induced transcriptomic profiles of these two species in order to identify linkages between patterns of gene expression, physiology and behavior. Sequencing produced over 425 million 100 bp reads. Using the de novo assembly package Trinity, we assembled the short reads into 321,250 contigs from giant floater (average length 835 bp) and 385,735 contigs from pondhorn (average length 929 bp). BLAST-based annotation and gene expression analysis revealed 2,832 differentially expressed genes in giant floater and 2,758 differentially expressed genes in pondhorn. Trancriptomic responses included changes in molecular chaperones, oxidative stress profiles, cell cycling, energy metabolism, immunity, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Comparative analyses between species indicated significantly higher induction of molecular chaperones and cytoskeletal elements in the intolerant P. grandis as well as important differences in genes regulating apoptosis and immunity.

T1  - Effects of fish on aquatic food webs at high elevation
AN  - 1651612951
AB  - In a study of 12 Colorado mountain lakes, some containing fish and some without fish, benthic invertebrate and zooplankton community composition and production were evaluated in relation to predictions of the concept of cascading trophic interactions. The trophic cascade concept predicts that lakes with fish will show lower abundance and production of primary consumers than lakes without fish. Data collected over a period of 4 years show that fish suppress benthic invertebrate and zooplankton abundance, as predicted by the trophic cascade concept, and reduce mean and maximum invertebrate body size, as expected from the literature. Contrary to the trophic cascade concept, however, production of benthic invertebrates and zooplankton did not differ between the two lake categories. Resilience of invertebrate production occurs because smaller body size of invertebrates leads to a higher ratio of production to biomass that is sufficient to compensate for the effect of reduced biomass of invertebrates. Also, the stable isotope signatures for δ13 C and δ15N show that the two categories of lakes did not differ in relative importance of energy sources for synthesis of biomass. Compensatory stability of prey production despite changes in prey biomass and composition may be a general phenomenon in food webs.     In 2013, as part of the same study, the effect of fish on lacustrine zooplankton in streams below lakes was quantified in 12 lakes with and without fish. Reductions of zooplankton abundance within lakes by fish predation caused lower transport of zooplankton to streams. Diel (24 hour) sampling showed that zooplankton export from both categories of lakes was nearly 4 times greater at night than during the day. Diel variation in export is explained by zooplankton migration from deep to shallow water at night.

T1  - Water quality of ponds at Edwardsville's Watershed Nature Center
AN  - 1648176407
AB  - Water quality problems, as a result of human activities, have become a worldwide concern.  Excess nitrogen and phosphorus entering waters from crop runoff, treated sewage plant effluent, and other industrial sources are leading to increased eutrophication in lakes and "dead zones" in oceans.  High levels of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus can cause algal blooms that result in decreased dissolved oxygen levels.  When the blooms consist of cyanobacteria, the problem is even worse.  These bacteria form a toxic secondary metabolite that can harm or kill fish and other vertebrates.   When nitrogen in a lake is limited, some cyanobacteria can "fix" their own from the atmosphere, so phosphorus pollution is the main contributing factor to cyanobacterial blooms.  The problem is being addressed globally by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), nationally by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and locally by communities and concerned citizens.    When the Watershed Nature Center (WNC) began, the plan was to restore the biodiversity of an ecosystem and to create a functioning wetland.  In order to do this, a certain level of water quality is needed.  Once established, the ongoing success or failure of this restoration project would be measured through water quality study and analysis.  This is the purpose of this study.  To evaluate this quality, measurements of field parameters including dissolved oxygen, water pH and temperature were taken at several locations.  Water grab samples were collected at a water inflow and outflow point.  They were also collected at stationary points in the two ponds of the WNC.  The study examined variations in the nitrogen to phosphorus levels as a result of rain.  Results indicated that, as a whole, the amount of rain does not have a statistically-significant effect on the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus.   The degree to which levels of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved solids (TDS) and water pH were affected by locations in the lakes, and seasons were also examined.  In the entire lake ecosystem, the highest ratio of TN:TP was in the autumn and lowest was in summer.  These results supported the hypothesis that the levels change with the seasons.  The variables were compared from their level at input sites to their levels at output to determine if the Watershed Nature Center is acting as a nutrient sink.  The results showed evidence of some nutrient trapping, especially of phosphorus.  Correlation analysis suggested that the variation in phosphorus and total dissolved solids may be driven by variation of these constituents in water inflows.

T1  - A bond rather than a barrier? Constructing the St. Lawrence Seaway
AN  - 1624909956
AB  - A mid-20th century water infrastructure megaproject, the St. Lawrence Seaway is a shipping channel that accommodates ships with a 26-foot draft and allows them to traverse a distance of 2,300 miles, from the headwaters of Lake Superior to the Atlantic Ocean. It also facilitates the production of hydroelectric power, harnessing the river’s kinetic energy to produce electrical current. Its official opening, in 1959, unified several formerly discrete elements into a coherent bi-national envirotechnical system. An environmental and technological system embedded in specific social and ecological contexts, the Seaway caused significant disruption—inundated and relocated communities and altered hydrologic dynamics are the most conspicuous repercussions of its construction and continued operation. Despite this contested history, the Seaway has been “naturalized” and masks many attendant ecological and socio-historical transformations. The Seaway’s symbolic power is as potent as its social and ecological legacies. The project and associated institutions have become symbols of bi-national cooperation, and are held up as exemplars of transboundary resource management. This symbolic legacy obscures the protracted and acrimonious debate that preceded Seaway construction, as well as alternative possibilities and perspectives marginalized in the process.    Accordingly, I contend that the Seaway has both engendered new bonds and simultaneously erected new barriers, transforming the landscape and peoples in myriad and often unanticipated ways. By teasing out the stories concealed by the dominant Seaway narrative, I show that the remaking of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence, between the 1820s and 1960s, materially and discursively reconfigured adjacent societies and landscapes.    Using envirotechnical analysis deployed in a bi-national narrative, I explore the Seaway as both a symbol and a reality. The boundaries between these forms are permeable not fixed, and both are crucial to its construction and operation. This story is, at its core, an interrogation of boundaries—a narrative focused on two nations and the river that divides and unites them. It is also about the boundaries drawn between culture and nature, the environment and technology, the abstract and physical, expertise and advocacy, as well as myth and materiality.

T1  - Depth distribution of a new invasive coral (Gulf of Mexico) – Tubastraea micranthus, comparisons with T. coccinea, and implications for control
AN  - 2287017792
AB  - The Indo-Pacific coral Tubastraea micranthus recently invaded a region near the Mississippi River mouth, Gulf of Mexico, and its populations have been expanding. Its congener, Tubastraea coccinea, invaded during the 1940s and is now common in the western Atlantic. Accessibility is important in determining whether an invasive species can be controlled/eradicated. In the marine environment, depth limits accessibility. We assessed the depth distribution of T. micranthus and T. coccinea on 15 oil/gas platforms using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Pooled data indicated that T. micranthus extends to 138 m and probably deeper, while T. coccinea is generally limited to < 78 m. Average depths for T. micranthus were shallower west of the Mississippi River, in its plume, and deeper towards the east. Tubastraea coccinea exhibited a similar geographic depth-distribution pattern, but shallower and subtler. Broad geographic patterns were similar whether using density or percent-cover data for analysis. When considering individual platforms, T. micranthus often reached the bottom and sometimes occurred at depths >138 m. Tubastraea coccinea were limited to shallow waters on all platforms. Detailed depth distribution patterns varied significantly between analyses using density and percent-cover data, with density probably indicating colonization rates, and percent-cover colony growth. Depth limitation by T. coccinea may be associated with food availability rather than light since it is azooxanthellate. The occurrence of T. micranthus in deep water will most likely make any control or eradication efforts difficult, due to cost and a rapid rate of population expansion.

T1  - Zebra mussels muscle way into Manitoba
AN  - 1442583999
AB  - "We still don't know how Lake Winnipeg became infested," said Laureen Janusz, a fisheries biologist with Manitoba Conservation and Water Stewardship.              The province learned of the problem after receiving a call last weekend from a boat owner at Winnipeg beach who spotted a zebra mussel on a vessel that was being winterized. Janusz drove out and discovered more of the pests on the underside of the dock. A check of some fishing boats in Gimli the same weekend produced more such discoveries. On Tuesday, an Ontario expert validated the finds.              The province has started an investigation to determine where the mollusc is established in Manitoba. It is deploying staff to Winnipeg Beach, Gimli and Hecla to inform residents and watercraft owners about the problem so it can receive help in tracking the invasive species. Government boat-inspection teams will be in Winnipeg Beach and Gimli starting this weekend and until the lake freezes.

T1  - Dog Stranglers in the Park?: National and Vegetal Politics in Ontario's Rouge Valley
AN  - 1524239119
AB  - The advent of the new Rouge National Urban Park in Toronto's northeast corner offers an important moment to reflect on many contested elements of national park politics, including ideas of wilderness and ecological integrity, changing articulations of nation and nature, the effects of neo-liberalization, and the role of parks in a globalizing, urbanizing environment. In addition, however, the Rouge highlights the intersecting question of plant/human relations, specifically concerning the rapid spread of the so-called aggressive invasive species dog-strangling vine (Cynanchum rossicum, known as DSV) in many portions of the park. DSV acutely calls into question ideas of nature and nation undergirding Parks Canada's mandate, and in so doing, demands that we attend to the actual physical and political history of the Rouge, the ways that history has afforded DSV with ideal conditions for its flourishing, the limits of current biopolitical discourses of invasive species management, and, for the new Rouge Park, the need for a more thoughtful, respectful, democratic approach to plant/human relations and to larger questions about what an urban park might be.

T1  - Speaker shows her mussells at recent MVFN natural history
AN  - 1418777969
AB  - Also since some mussells are quite long lived, many living decades, they carry within their tissues a useful record of biological and chemical changes in the environment. As they age annual rings form in the shell as in a tree. According to [Jacqueline Madill], some Eastern Pondshells can live 200 years! But why are mussells so endangered? At one time, commercial harvest and disruption from log drives reduced their numbers, but these are not ongoing. Sadly, and to our peril, the current plight of bivalves reflects the damage we have done and are doing to water and its inhabitants. [Mussells] need clean, clear running water relatively high in oxygen and water bodies connected to maintain stable levels and flow, provide nutrients, and permit dispersal of the young. In turn, the density and persistence of these creatures are good indicators of healthy waters. Main disrupters are dams and locks that restrict flow and cause extreme fluctuation in temperature and levels of water. According to Madill, it can take 50 to 100 years for an area of mussells to be reestablished once it has been disrupted. Mussells are also particularly sensitive to pollutants of many kinds which include fertilizers from lawns and cropland. Many large water bodies and waterways have been made uninhabitable by channeling, loss of near shore habitat, and choking with litter and debris. Another significant threat has been the invasive Zebra Mussel, perhaps the most damaging to our native bivalves, as well as to human infrastructure such as intake pipes. It appeared in the Great Lakes in 1988 on ships from Middle Europe. Of incredible reproductive capacity, one female can produce 30,000 to 1,000,000 larvae annually. Madill noted that mussells of the Rideau River have suffered a 'double whammy' from zebra mussells and the rapid and alternating water levels due to the canal locks. In 10 years, zebra mussells have spread throughout the Great Lakes smothering large beds of native bivalves.

T1  - Assessing the cryptic invasion of a domestic conspecific: A merican mink in their native range
AN  - 2290714878
AB  - Control of invasions is facilitated by their early detection, but this may be difficult when invasions are cryptic due to similarity between invaders and native species. Domesticated conspecifics offer an interesting example of cryptic invasions because they have the ability to hybridize with their native counterparts, and can thus facilitate the introgression of maladaptive genes. We assessed the cryptic invasion of escaped domestic American mink (Neovison vison) within their native range. Feral mink are a known alien invader in many parts of the world, but invasion of their native range is not well understood. We genetically profiled 233 captive domestic mink from different farms in Ontario, Canada and 299 free‐ranging mink from Ontario, and used assignments tests to ascertain genetic ancestries of free‐ranging animals. We found that 18% of free‐ranging mink were either escaped domestic animals or hybrids, and a tree regression showed that these domestic genotypes were most likely to occur south of a latitude of 43.13°N, within the distribution of mink farms in Ontario. Thus, domestic mink appear not to have established populations in Ontario in locations without fur farms. We suspect that maladaptation of domestic mink and outbreeding depression of hybrid and introgressed mink have limited their spread. Mink farm density and proximity to mink farms were not important predictors of domestic genotypes but rather, certain mink farms appeared to be important sources of escaped domestic animals. Our results show that not all mink farms are equal with respect to biosecurity, and thus that the spread of domestic genotypes can be mitigated by improved biosecurity.

T1  - Rivermouth Alteration of Agricultural Impacts on Consumer Tissue δ15N
AN  - 1440999813
AB  - Terrestrial agricultural activities strongly influence riverine nitrogen (N) dynamics, which is reflected in the δ15N of riverine consumer tissues. However, processes within aquatic ecosystems also influence consumer tissue δ15N. As aquatic processes become more important terrestrial inputs may become a weaker predictor of consumer tissue δ15N. In a previous study, this terrestrial-consumer tissue δ15N connection was very strong at river sites, but was disrupted by processes occurring in rivermouths (the ‘rivermouth effect’). This suggested that watershed indicators of N loading might be accurate in riverine settings, but could be inaccurate when considering N loading to the nearshore of large lakes and oceans. In this study, the rivermouth effect was examined on twenty-five sites spread across the Laurentian Great Lakes. Relationships between agriculture and consumer tissue δ15N occurred in both upstream rivers and at the outlets where rivermouths connect to the nearshore zone, but agriculture explained less variation and had a weaker effect at the outlet. These results suggest that rivermouths may sometimes be significant sources or sinks of N, which would cause N loading estimates to the nearshore zone that are typically made at discharge gages further upstream to be inaccurate. Identifying definitively the controls over the rivermouth effect on N loading (and other nutrients) will require integration of biogeochemical and hydrologic models.

AB  - “Summing Up: Highly recommended. Lower-division undergraduates through graduate students, researchers/faculty, land managers, policy makers, and interested general readers.” (Choice, 1 February 2014) “Young scientists starting out in this field who read this book will not only gain an appreciation of our current state of knowledge, but, perhaps more importantly, will also learn where our knowledge is limited and what research questions are prime for tackling.” (Biological Conservation, 1 January 2014) “This is certainly by far still the best introduction to this important topic around, and those that bought the first edition should snap this one up also for the increased topicality. The work is also available in various electronic formats, which should further encourage its take-up by the current student generation.” (Biodivers Conserv, 1 September 2013) “Overall, I can fully recommend this book. As the 1st edition, this 2nd edition will be valuable for students, researchers, managers, and anybody else interested in bio- logical invasions. It reads very well and is technically well done; I spotted only few typos. The companion website (www.wiley.com/go/invasionecology) with down- loadable versions of the book’s figures and tables is also very useful.” (Basic and Applied Ecology, 1 October 2013)

T1  - Development of sensitive and specific molecular tools for the efficient detection and discrimination of potentially invasive mussel species of the genus Perna
AN  - 2287071414
AB  - Marine mussels of the genus Perna include three species: P. canaliculus, P. viridis and P. perna. While P. canaliculus appears to be greatly restricted to its endemic range of New Zealand, P. perna and P. viridis introductions have been recorded outside their native ranges in several regions of the globe. Such introductions have often resulted in significant negative ecological, economic and social impacts. Perna perna and P. viridis are exotic to Australia and are listed under the Australian Government National System for the Prevention and Management of Marine Pest Incursions as high priority species. Rapid detection of marine pests such as Perna species remains fundamental to their effective containment and control. The present study reports on the development and validation of both conventional and real-time PCR assays suited to the rapid identification and discrimination of juvenile and adult specimens of P. viridis, P. canaliculus and P. perna. The development of a sensitive high-throughput real-time PCR assay offers further potential for the efficient detection of the presence of single Perna specimens in mixed populations of native mussel species, and for early detection of larval stages in ballast water and plankton samples. This assay offers considerable advantages over traditional identification methods and represents an important step in developing capacity for efficient identification and management of Perna species incursions in Australian waters.

T1  - The Body Size-Dependent Diet Composition of North American Sea Ducks in Winter
AN  - 1365188404
AB  - Daily food requirements scale with body mass and activity in animals. While small species of birds have higher mass-specific field metabolic rates than larger species, larger species have higher absolute energy costs. Under energy balance, we thus expect the small species to have a higher energy value diet. Also the weight and time constraints for flighted and diurnal foragers should set a maximum to the amount of prey items taken in one meal and to the daily number of meals, respectively. Further, avoidance of competition causes the species to reduce the amount of shared prey in their diet. Some diet segregation is therefore to be expected between species. We tested these hypotheses and investigated the role of body mass in the diet composition of 12 sea duck species (Somateria mollissima, Somateria spectabilis, Somateria fischeri, Polysticta stelleri, Bucephala clangula, Bucephala islandica, Bucephala albeola, Melanitta nigra, Melanitta perspicillata, Melanitta deglandi, Histrionicus histrionicus and Clangula hyemalis) wintering in North America. This study was based on a literature survey with special emphasis given to the diet data from the former US Bureau of Biological Survey. The data supported our hypothesis that the energy value of winter diet of sea ducks scales negatively with body mass. Diet diversity also scaled negatively with body mass. Our results suggest the existence of a minimum for the energy value of avian diets.

T1  - Coping with Change: A Closer Look at the Underlying Attributes of Change and the Individual Response to Unstable Environments
AN  - 1537429778
AB  - Although the study of environmental change has long been of academic interest, the effects of change have become a much more pressing concern in the past few decades due to the often disruptive effect of human expansion and innovation. Researchers from many fields contribute to understanding our footprint on the natural world, problems we cause, and strategies we can employ to protect key species and ecosystems. Unfortunately, environmental change and its consequences are often studied without an awareness of the inherent attributes of the changes. As a result, the relevance of new advances in this field may be easily missed or misunderstood, and existing knowledge is not optimally applied. In this paper, we aim to facilitate the multi-disciplinary comparison of studies on environmental change, by offering a meta-level perspective on the process of change from the point of view of the individual animal. We propose an inclusive definition of change that can be applied across contexts, in which we take our understanding of "change" from an event to an interaction between a physical occurrence and an individual's state. Furthermore, we discuss key event- and individual-based attributes of change, their relevance in today's changing world, and how they relate to animals' available behavioural, physiological and cross-generational responses. We hope that by uncovering the underlying fundamental (or structure) of change, fellow scientists may better share their experience and knowledge gained from years of studying individual species and situations.

T1  - Does Ecophysiology Determine Invasion Success? A Comparison between the Invasive Boatman Trichocorixa verticalis verticalis and the Native Sigara lateralis (Hemiptera, Corixidae) in South-West Spain
AN  - 1352841022
AB  - Background Trichocorixa verticalis verticalis, a native of North America, is the only alien corixid identified in Europe. First detected in 1997 in southern Portugal, it has spread into south-west Spain including Doñana National Park. Its impact on native taxa in the same area is unclear, but it is the dominant species in several permanent, saline wetlands. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated whether the ecophysiology of this alien species favours its spread in the Iberian Peninsula and its relative success in saline areas. We compared physiological responses to heating (Critical Thermal maximum), cooling (Critical Thermal minimum) and freezing (Super Cooling Point) in the native Sigara lateralis and introduced T. v. verticalis acclimated to different temperatures and salinities. The larger S. lateralis generally outperformed T. v. verticalis and appeared to possess a broader thermal tolerance range. In both taxa, CTmax was highest in animals exposed to a combination of high conductivities and relatively low acclimation temperatures. However, CTmax was generally higher in T. v. verticalis and lower in S. lateralis when acclimated at higher temperatures. CTmin were lower (greater tolerance to cold) after acclimation to high conductivities in T. v. verticalis, and following acclimation to low conductivities in S. lateralis. Both acclimation temperature and conductivity influenced corixids' freezing tolerance; however, only in T. v. verticalis did SCP decrease after exposure to both high temperature and conductivity. T. v. verticalis showed a higher range of mean responses over all treatments. Conclusions Whilst the native S. lateralis may have a broader thermal range, the alien species performs particularly well at higher salinities and temperatures and this ability may facilitate its invasion in Mediterranean areas. The greater plasticity of T. v. verticalis may further facilitate its spread in the future, as it may be more able to respond to climate shifts than the native species.

T1  - Key Topics in Conservation Biology 2
AN  - 2131863935
AB  - Following the much acclaimed success of the first volume of 
Key Topics in Conservation Biology, this entirely new second volume addresses an innovative array of key topics in contemporary conservation biology.  Written by an internationally renowned team of authors, 
Key Topics in Conservation Biology 2 adds to the still topical foundations laid in the first volume (published in 2007) by exploring a further 25 cutting-edge issues in modern biodiversity conservation, including controversial subjects such as setting conservation priorities, balancing the focus on species and ecosystems, and financial mechanisms to value biodiversity and pay for its conservation. Other chapters, setting the framework for conservation, address the sociology and philosophy of peoples' relation with Nature and its impact on health, and such challenging practical issues as wildlife trade and conflict between people and carnivores. As a new development, this second volume of Key Topics includes chapters on major ecosystems, such as forests, islands and both fresh and marine waters, along with case studies of the conservation of major taxa: plants, butterflies, birds and mammals. A further selection of topics consider how to safeguard the future through monitoring, reserve planning, corridors and connectivity, together with approaches to reintroduction and re-wilding, along with managing wildlife disease. A final chapter, by the editors, synthesises thinking on the relationship between biodiversity conservation and human development. 
Each topic is explored by a team of top international experts, assembled to bring their own cross-cutting knowledge to a penetrating synthesis of the issues from both theoretical and practical perspectives. 
The interdisciplinary nature of biodiversity conservation is reflected throughout the book. Each essay examines the fundamental principles of the topic, the methodologies involved and, crucially, the human dimension. In this way, Key Topics in Conservation Biology 2, like its sister volume, 
Key Topics in Conservation Biology, embraces issues from cutting-edge ecological science to policy, environmental economics, governance, ethics, and the practical issues of implementation. 

Key Topics in Conservation Biology 2 will, like its sister volume, be a valuable resource in universities and colleges, government departments, and conservation agencies. It is aimed particularly at senior undergraduate and graduate students in conservation biology and wildlife management and wider ecological and environmental subjects, and those taking Masters degrees in any field relevant to conservation and the environment. Conservation practitioners, policy-makers, and the wider general public eager to understand more about important environmental issues will also find this book invaluable.

T1  - Invasive Alien Species:&nbsp;A New Synthesis
AN  - 2508047890
AB  - Invasive alien species are among today's mdaunting environmental threats, costing billions of dollars in economic damages and wreaking havoc on ecosystems around the world. In 1997, a consortium of scientific organizations including SCOPE, IUCN, and CABI developed the Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP) with the explicit objective of providing new tools for understanding and coping with invasive alien species. Invasive Alien Species is the final report of GISP's first phase of operation, 1997-2000, in which authorities from more than thirty countries worked to examine invasions as a worldwide environmental hazard. The book brings together the world's leading scientists and researchers involved with invasive alien species to offer a comprehensive summary and synthesis of the currstate of knowledge on the subject. Invasive alien species represa critical threat to natural ecosystems and native biodiversity, as well as to human economic vitality and health. The knowledge gained to date in understanding and combating invasive alien species can form a useful basis on which to build strategies for controlling or minimizing the effects in the future. Invasive Alien Species is an essential reference for the international community of investigators concerned with biological invasions.

T1  - Impact of Engineered Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles on the Individual Performance of Mytilus galloprovincialis
AN  - 1344123511
AB  - The increased use of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) in consumer products raises the concern of environmental release and subsequent impacts in natural communities. We tested for physiological and demographic impacts of ZnO, a prevalent metal oxide ENP, on the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. We exposed mussels of two size classes, <4.5 and ≥4.5 cm shell length, to 0.1–2 mg l−1 ZnO ENPs in seawater for 12 wk, and measured the effect on mussel respiration, accumulation of Zn, growth, and survival. After 12 wk of exposure to ZnO ENPs, respiration rates of mussels increased with ZnO concentration. Mussels had up to three fold more Zn in tissues than control groups after 12 wk of exposure, but patterns of Zn accumulation varied with mussel size and Zn concentrations. Small mussels accumulated Zn 10 times faster than large mussels at 0.5 mg l−1, while large mussels accumulated Zn four times faster than small mussels at 2 mg l−1. Mussels exposed to 2 mg l−1 ZnO grew 40% less than mussels in our control group for both size classes. Survival significantly decreased only in groups exposed to the highest ZnO concentration (2 mg l−1) and was lower for small mussels than large. Our results indicate that ZnO ENPs are toxic to mussels but at levels unlikely to be reached in natural marine waters.

T1  - The application of a Biopollution Index in German Baltic estuarine and lagoon waters
AN  - 2287017477
AB  - This paper assesses the status of three German Baltic estuarine and lagoon waters with respect to invasive species (macrozoobenthos) and their impact. A Biological Pollution Index was applied and evaluated. Overall 130 macrozoobenthic species were identified, 17 of which were aquatic alien species. The Szczecin Lagoon had the highest number of invasive species (13). Most species were of Pontocaspian origin; inland waterways are likely to play a significant role in their migration. According to the Biological Pollution Index Level (BPL) this lagoon was ‘moderately influenced’ by invasive species. Warnow Estuary had 11 invasive species; their origin noted generally from North-America, suggesting shipping traffic as the major distribution vector; invasive species had the same BPL as in the Szczecin Lagoon. In the Darß Zingst Bodden Chain only 6 invasive species were observed, having the highest relative abundance (9-71%). Furthermore, this area had the highest BPL of all three areas, i.e. a strong negative impact. The BPL required a lot of data (including historical) and some ratings were subjective and comparisons with other areas assessed were difficult and often impossible. Due to these limitations, it is suggested that the BPL should only be used with restrictions as a universal assessment tool for invasive species in the estuarine and lagoon waters of the Baltic Sea.

T1  - Is there a need for a more explicit accounting of invasive alien species under the Water Framework Directive?
AN  - 2287016612
AB  - Through ratification of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), EU Member States committed themselves to a pressure-based assessment of the ecological status of their water bodies. Invasive alien species (IAS) constitute a major pressure in many aquatic ecosystems, yet are not explicitly accounted for by the majority of WFD assessment methods. Most Member States argue that no explicit assessment of IAS is required, assuming that significant IAS pressures will affect the WFD biological quality elements (BQEs), and be detected by generic WFD status assessments. We tested this assumption for a selection of country-by-surface-water category combinations, covering nearly 40,000 water bodies. For each of the combinations, the pressure by high-impact IAS is higher in water bodies with ecological status varying from bad to moderate than in water bodies in good or high ecological status. Most high-impact IAS show strong associations with low status class categories. Of the 17 most frequently occurring high-impact IAS, only Mustela vison (Schreber, 1777) and Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1853) are disproportionately frequent in high status water bodies. The sensitivity of WFD methods varies across BQEs, with macrophyte-based methods showing a consistently high sensitivity to IAS pressures. However, significant pressures are observed in a number of high status water bodies. This points to a need for further optimization of existing methods so that they address the full range of pressures exerted by IAS.

T1  - The Role of Zooplankton in Cyanobacteria Bloom Development in Australian Reservoirs
AN  - 3039732124
AB  - Cyanobacteria occupy diverse aquatic habitats and their ecological success is expected to increase under predicted future climate scenarios. Managing cyanobacteria abundance in freshwaters is therefore critical for reducing risks to human and animal health. One species that is currently undergoing range expansion from subtropical to temperate habitats is Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii.C. raciborskii is ecologically successful because of its (1) competitive nutrient acquisition and storage mechanisms (e.g. high affinity for phosphorus (P) and ammonium, high P-storage capacity); (2) wide thermal tolerance, superior shade tolerance and buoyancy regulation; (Briand et al. 2002) and (3) resistance to grazing. To date, research to understand the formation of C. raciborskiiblooms and toxicity have mostly focused on environmental factors, but the importance of food web interactions in regulating blooms has been little investigated. In particular, there is a need to examine these foodweb interactions in subtropical systems in the Southern Hemisphere because much of the current understanding about zooplankton-cyanobacteria interactions comes from temperate systems dominated by large-bodied cladocerans. Given that warmer subtropical systems are dominated by copepods and smaller-bodied individuals, it is likely that interactions between zooplankton and phytoplankton have different outcomes for cyanobacterial bloom formation.To understand the mechanisms of toxic cyanobacterium C. raciborskii bloom formation in subtropical oligotrophic Australian lakes, a series of investigations were undertaken across multiple spatial and temporal scales to test the hypothesis that C. raciborskii growth is facilitated by meso-zooplankton. Specifically, small-scale laboratory experiments (~100 ml) examined zooplankton grazing and tested whether copepods avoid consumption of C. raciborskii under food saturating conditions (Chapter 2). Both the direct (grazing) and indirect (nutrient regeneration) effects of zooplankton on C. raciborskii were further examined in laboratory experiments (Chapter 3). These laboratory experiments were then scaled up to mesocosms (~500 litres), where in situ C. raciborskii growth was examined under different treatments (control, 1x and 5x ambient zooplankton abundance, 5x ambient zooplankton abundance + inorganic P) (Chapter 4). Comparisons between zooplankton populations were also made at the reservoir scale, testing to see whether lakes experiencing C. raciborskiiblooms had different zooplankton biomass, size structure and functional group composition compared to lakes that do not experience blooms (Chapter 5).In Chapter 2, the hypothesis that copepod consumers discriminate against C. raciborskii was tested. Experiments were designed based on observed seasonal variation in food quantity and quality for zooplankton in subtropical Australian lakes and reservoirs, and tested whether clearance rates were dependent on the P-content of prey, the proportion of C. raciborskii present and the previous feeding history of zooplankton. The results indicated that the clearance rates of copepods on C. raciborskii were 2-4 times lower than that of a cladoceran Ceriodaphnia sp. when both grazers had prey choice. The copepod Boeckella sp. was found to select against C. raciborskii when alternative food was abundant, but selectivity declined when animals had been kept in low food conditions for 2-12 hours before experimentation. The clearance rates of Boeckella sp. on two toxic C. raciborskii strains were significantly lower than on a nontoxic strain. Clearance rates were also significantly lower on C. raciborskii with low cellular P content and when present at >5% relative abundance amongst natural phytoplankton assemblages. Together these results suggest that copepods largely avoid consumption of C. raciborskii.In Chapter 3, the impact of zooplankton nutrient regeneration on C. raciborskii growth was evaluated. Indirect effects of zooplankton interactions may be relatively important seasonally when dissolved nutrient concentrations are low. Dialysis experiments were designed to simultaneously test the direct (grazing) and indirect effects (nutrient regeneration) of zooplankton-algal interactions, enabling zooplankton to access food outside the dialysis tubing, and for zooplankton-derived nutrients to be accessible to algae inside the tubing. Controls with no zooplankton were also set up to account for nutrient contributions from algal prey. Zooplankton-derived nutrients alleviated P-limitation of C. raciborskii inside the dialysis tubes and stimulated growth. Furthermore, C. raciborskii growth was favoured above a green algal competitor when both algae were in dialysis tubes, indicating C. raciborskii is more efficient at taking up P recycled by zooplankton. Outside the dialysis bags, zooplankton grazed a green alga in preference to C. raciborskii and selectively consumed P-replete cells. C. raciborskiigrowth was therefore affected both directly and indirectly by zooplankton, suggesting that foodweb interactions can facilitate blooms of this cyanobacterium.In Chapter 4, zooplankton regulation of C. raciborskii dominance in a natural phytoplankton community was tested at a larger scale using mesocosms deployed in a subtropical reservoir. Laboratory studies often cannot account for diversity of natural assemblages, so treatments were set up to examine C. raciborskii growth under different zooplankton densities and P loading. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first field experiment to promote C. raciborskii through zooplankton manipulation. Zooplankton enrichment resulted in an increase in C. raciborskiirelative abundance from 15% to 37% after four days. Simultaneously, elevated zooplankton lowered the C:P ratio of phytoplankton, supporting the notion that copepods tend to alleviate P limitation in the environment.The generality of zooplankton-cyanobacteria interactions were examined in Chapter 5, which describes a survey of 15 subtropical reservoirs. Reservoirs were split into two groups (those experiencing C. raciborskii blooms and those that don’t), and their zooplankton biomass, size structure and functional group composition were examined. The survey was carried out in both the wet and dry season to capture seasonal variations of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities and associated environmental variables. It was expected that C. raciborskii presence would be positively correlated to copepod abundance and negatively correlated to particulate N:P ratios. Ecological stoichiometry predicts that zooplankton with different body N:P content will differ in their relative rate of recycling of N and P. Copepods have low P content thus recycle nutrients with low N:P ratio into the environment. The survey demonstrated that reservoirs experiencing C. raciborskii blooms had a greater abundance of copepods compared to cladocerans, and a smaller proportion of juveniles. The correlation between environmental factors and C. raciborskiipresence/absence was not statistically significant, but copepod abundance was negatively correlated to particulate N:P.Together, these results suggest that C. raciborskii is most likely facilitated through a planktonic foodweb subsidy in copepod-dominated subtropical oligotrophic lakes, whereby copepods consume other algae in preference to C. raciborskii when alternative algae are abundant, then regenerate nutrients that are then rapidly taken up by low P-adapted C. raciborskii. In terms of management implications, this thesis has demonstrated that biomanipulation by increasing zooplankton abundance in reservoirs of subtropical Queensland where calanoid copepods are dominant would not be very effective. Based on the data collected and the major findings, recommendations are made for sustainable management of Australian subtropical reservoirs.

T1  - Practical guidelines for modelling post-entry spread in invasion ecology
AN  - 2169924731
AB  - In this article we review a variety of methods to enable understanding and modelling the spread of a pest or pathogen post-entry. Building upon our experience of multidisciplinary research in this area, we propose practical guidelines and a framework for model development, to help with the application of mathematical modelling in the field of invasion ecology for post-entry spread. We evaluate the pros and cons of a range of methods, including references to examples of the methods in practice. We also show how issues of data deficiency and uncertainty can be addressed. The aim is to provide guidance to the reader on the most suitable elements to include in a model of post-entry dispersal in a risk assessment, under differing circumstances. We identify both the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and their application as part of a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to biosecurity research.

T1  - Interactions Between Inbreeding and Environmental Stressors: Implications for Ecotoxicology
AN  - 1557568840
AB  - In this thesis the effects of individual and multiple environmental stressors (physical and chemical) are examined in inbred and outbred zebrafish (Danio rerio, Hamilton), a model species used in ecotoxicology and environmental risk assessment (ERA). The central question addressed is, are inbred laboratory animals representative and protective of wild populations? That is, are inbred fish equally or more sensitive to chemicals and other stressors compared with more outbred (wild) fish? A combination of tools and approaches incorporating traditional (eco)toxicology and population genetics have been employed, together with more contemporary molecular genetics and population modelling, to compare and contrast a range of responses in inbred and outbred zebrafish exposed to the endocrine disrupting chemical clotrimazole and/or temperature elevation in the laboratory. The choice of test species was based on our broad understanding of its basic biology, extending from the molecular level to the population level, and its wide use as a model organism in (eco)toxicology. Selection of the test chemical clotrimazole and temperature was based on a shared mode of action, aromatase inhibition, and therefore their ability to block oestrogen production, impair reproduction, promote male development and skew population sex ratios in zebrafish.A cascade of responses were compared in inbred and outbred zebrafish, including changes in the levels of expression of genes for gonadal aromatase and other steroidogenic enzymes, circulating sex steroid hormones, gonadal sex differentiation and development (via gonadal histopathology) and reproductive fitness (female fecundity, paternity and viability of embryos). Amongst the most striking results were directional skews in sex ratio towards males in response to clotrimazole (Chapter 5) and elevated temperature exposure (Chapter 7). Inbred fish were generally more responsive compared to outbreds, which showed evidence of physiological and developmental compensation, resulting in lower male-sex skews and superior fitness in terms of male reproductive success (paternity and viability of embryos). The greater effects observed in inbred fish were attributed to inbreeding×environment interactions and the amplification of inbreeding depression. Although no empirical genetic evidence of this mechanism is presented (loss of heterozygosity at quantitative trait loci and concomitant loss of heterosis and/or the expression of recessive, deleterious alleles in homozygotes), supporting evidence was provided by increased phenotypic variance in some apical endpoints in inbred fish, including specific growth rate and fecundity. This increased variance also has the potential to counteract the higher levels of response observed in inbreds, because the power to detect statistically significant changes in responses is reduced. This trade-off was demonstrated for specific growth rate.Crucially, significant male-sex ratio skews (>80%) were induced at substantially lower clotrimazole exposure concentrations (1.7 µg l-1) in combination with elevated temperature (33°C), compared with exposure concentrations (43.7 µg l-1) generating similar sex ratio skews at the standard test temperature of 28°C. These temperatures represent current and predicted 2100 (elevated) mean temperatures in the zebrafish’s native India and Bangladesh. Although the lowest observed effect concentration was an order of magnitude above the predicted environmental concentration for clotrimazole, it is conceivable that combined environmental exposures to similarly acting chemicals (e.g. other azole compounds used in crop protection, veterinary and human medicine) could produce similar effects to those we observed. The consequent effects of sex ratios skews and reduced fitness (fecundity and embryo viability) on per capita population growth rate (r) and extinction probability were predicted in inbred versus outbred zebrafish populations using stochastic population viability analysis. The results showed that the observed male-skews >80% threaten small zebrafish populations with fewer than 100 breeding adults (<20 adult females). However, small reductions of 2-3% in embryo-juvenile (age 0+) survivorship (including simulated inbreeding depression) were more influential on r and extinction probability than large sex ratio skews and/or reduced female fecundity.The results presented in this thesis support the contention that chemical effects may be exacerbated by other environmental stressors, but also illustrate the importance of considering biological (genetic), as well as physical and chemical interactions in cumulative ERA. Greater sensitivity of inbred versus outbred organisms to the effects of environmental stressors on sexual differentiation and reproductive fitness offers a margin of safety to ERA and the protection of wildlife populations (excluding those that are severely inbred and critically endangered). This is because, as originally stated, laboratory organisms used in ERA are generally more inbred than their wild counterparts. Nevertheless, more attention should be paid to the origin, breeding history and genetics of laboratory strains. This will help to ensure consistency between studies and testing laboratories and provide more confidence in extrapolating the results to wild populations.

T1  - Nitrifiers and their contribution to oxygen consumption in Lake Erie
AN  - 1531327993
AB  - Nitrification is a prokaryote-mediated oxygen consumptive process of the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite/nitrate that traditionally has been only viewed as a nutrient transformation process. Renewed concern about hypoxia in the shallow hypolimnion of the Central Basin of Lake Erie provides impetus for examining whether nitrification has a significant impact on oxygen dynamics. To evaluate the contribution of nitrification to oxygen demand, water column and sediment samples were collected during the summers of 2008-2010 in Lake Erie and the oxygen consumption due to nitrification and the abundance and distribution of potential bacterial (AOB) and archaeal (AOA) that oxidize ammonia to nitrite was characterized in water column and sediment samples by qPCR of a portion of the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene. Environmental variables and nitrification rates were examined for correlations to understand factors that may control nitrification rates and/or the distribution of nitrifiers. The nitrification rate in the epilimnion and hypolimnion was 3.1 ± 3.2 micromole N/L/day and 3.7 ± 2.9 (mean ± 1 SD) micromole oxygen/L/day respectively. Nitrification accounted for 28.2 ± 23.1% of the total oxygen consumption in the epilimnion and 32.6 ± 22.2% in the hypolimnion. Oxygen consumption by nitrification in sediment slurries and intact sediment cores was 7.1 ± 5.8 micromole oxygen/gram/day and 682 ± 61.1 micromole oxygen/square m/day respectively. Nitrification accounted for 27.0 ± 19.2% of the total oxygen consumption in sediment slurries and 30.4 ± 10.7% in intact sediment cores. AOA and AOB were present in all samples, with a distribution that was variable over time and space. Highlighting the potential importance of archaeal nitrifiers, the AOA/AOB ratio in the epilimnion, hypolimnion, and sediments was 1.02, 1.08, and 5.25. The nitrification rate or nitrifier numbers did not strongly correlate with environmental factors such as oxygen, nitrate or ammonium. In the water column, respiration and the percentage of oxygen used due to nitrification were negatively correlated. While nitrification is unlikely to be the dominant oxygen consumptive process, the rates observed in Lake Erie were sufficient to theoretically deplete a large portion of the hypolimnetic oxygen pool during the stratified period.

T1  - mRNA-Seq and microarray development for the Grooved carpet shell clam, Ruditapes decussatus : a functional approach to unravel host -parasite interaction
AN  - 1458383052
AB  - Doc number: 741              Abstract              Background: The Grooved Carpet shell clam Ruditapes decussatus  is the autochthonous European clam and the most appreciated from a gastronomic and economic point of view. The production is in decline due to several factors such as Perkinsiosis and habitat invasion and competition by the introduced exotic species, the manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum . After we sequenced R. decussatus  transcriptome we have designed an oligo microarray capable of contributing to provide some clues on molecular response of the clam to Perkinsiosis.              Results: A database consisting of 41,119 unique transcripts was constructed, of which 12,479 (30.3%) were annotated by similarity. An oligo-DNA microarray platform was then designed and applied to profile gene expression in R. decussatus  heavily infected by Perkinsus olseni.  Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes between those two conditionswas performed by gene set enrichment analysis. As expected, microarrays unveil genes related with stress/infectious agents such as hydrolases, proteases and others. The extensive role of innate immune system was also analyzed and effect of parasitosis upon expression of important molecules such as lectins reviewed.              Conclusions: This study represents a first attempt to characterize Ruditapes decussatus  transcriptome, an important marine resource for the European aquaculture. The trancriptome sequencing and consequent annotation will increase the available tools and resources for this specie, introducing the possibility of high throughput experiments such as microarrays analysis. In this specific case microarray approach was used to unveil some important aspects of host-parasite interaction between the Carpet shell clam and Perkinsus , two non-model species, highlighting some genes associated with this interaction. Ample information was obtained to identify biological processes significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes in Perkinsus  infected versus non-infected gills. An overview on the genes related with the immune system on R. decussatus  transcriptome is also reported.

T1  - Strain-related variation in the persistence of influenza A virus in three types of water: distilled water, filtered surface water, and intact surface water
AN  - 1313225125; 23289857
AB  - Doc number: 13              Abstract              Background: The persistence of influenza A (IA) virus in aquatic habitats has been demonstrated to be a determinant for virus transmission dynamics in wild duck populations. In this study, we investigated virus strain-related variation in persistence in water for nine wild duck isolated IA viruses of three subtypes (H3N8, H4N6, and H8N4).              Results: We experimentally estimated the loss of infectivity over time in three different types of water: distilled, filtered surface water, and intact surface water. All viruses persisted longest in distilled water followed by filtered surface water with markedly reduced durations of persistence observed in the intact surface water. Strain-related variations were observed in distilled and filtered surface water but limited variation was observed in the intact surface water.              Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the role of surface water for long-term (between years) maintenance of AI viruses in the environment may be limited, and suggest that the physico-chemical characteristics of water, as well as microorganisms, may be of strong importance. Results also indicate that the extent of strain-related variation observed in distilled water may overestimate persistence abilities for IA viruses in the wild and supports the need to develop experiments that account for these effects to assess subtype, genotype, as well as spatial and temporal variation in the persistence of IA viruses in aquatic habitats.

T1  - Harvesting the Biosphere:&nbsp;What We Have Taken from Nature
AN  - 2131130488
AB  - An interdisciplinary and quantitative account of human claims on the biosphere's stores of living matter, from prehistoric hunting to modern energy production. 
The biosphere--the Earth's thin layer of life--dates from nearly four billion years ago, when the first simple organisms appeared. Many species have exerted enormous influence on the biosphere's character and productivity, but none has transformed the Earth in so many ways and on such a scale as 
Homo sapiens. In 
Harvesting the Biosphere, Vaclav Smil offers an interdisciplinary and quantitative account of human claims on the biosphere's stores of living matter, from prehistory to the present day. Smil examines all harvests--from prehistoric man's hunting of megafauna to modern crop production--and all uses of harvested biomass, including energy, food, and raw materials. Without harvesting of the biomass, Smil points out, there would be no story of human evolution and advancing civilization; but at the same time, the increasing extent and intensity of present-day biomass harvests are changing the very foundations of civilization's well-being. 
In his detailed and comprehensive account, Smil presents the best possible quantifications of past and current global losses in order to assess the evolution and extent of biomass harvests. Drawing on the latest work in disciplines ranging from anthropology to environmental science, Smil offers a valuable long-term, planet-wide perspective on human-caused environmental change.

T1  - Invasion process of Limnoperna fortunei (Bivalvia: Mytilidae): the case of Uruguay River and emissaries of the Esteros del Ibera Wetland, Argentina
AN  - 1287988019
AB  - Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker, 1857), during its invasion process in South America, has caused severe impacts both on natural environments altering native biodiversity, ecosystem structure and function-, and on man-made structures causing economic looses. Twenty-one samples were taken from the right bank of the Uruguay River, from tributaries of the Uruguay and Paraná Rivers, the drainage of the Esteros del Ibera Wetland. Based on this fieldwork, the presence of larvae and adults of L. fortunei was determined. Also, through the comparison of environmental characteristic with the known tolerance limits for the species, the possibility of its establishment in environments not yet invaded was determined. Most of the sampling stations have features that allow the development of stable populations L. fortunei, including the rivers that drain the Esteros del Ibera, allowing access of this invasive species to this important wetland.

T1  - The fate of an immigrant: Ensis directus in the eastern German Bight
AN  - 1037275505
AB  - We studied Ensis directus in the subtidal (7-16 m depth) of the eastern German Bight. The jack-knife clam that invaded in the German Bight in 1978 has all characteristics of a successful immigrant: Ensis directus has a high reproductive capacity (juveniles, July 2001: Amrumbank 1,914 m^sup -2^, Eiderstedt/Vogelsand: 11,638 m^sup -2^), short generation times and growths rapidly: maximum growth rates were higher than in former studies (mean: 3 mm month^sup -1^, 2nd year: up to 14 mm month^sup -1^). Ensis directus uses natural mechanisms for rapid dispersal, occurs gregariously and exhibits a wide environmental tolerance. However, optimal growth and population-structure annual gaps might be influenced by reduced salinity: at Vogelsand (transition area of Elbe river), maximum growth was lower (164 mm) than at the Eiderstedt site (outer range of Elbe river, L ^sub ∞^ = 174 mm). Mass mortalities of the clams are probably caused by washout (video inspections), low winter temperature and strong storms. Ensis directus immigrated into the community finding its own habitat on mobile sands with strong tidal currents. Recent studies on E. directus found that the species neither suppresses native species nor takes over the position of an established one which backs up our study findings over rather short time scales. On the contrary, E. directus seems to favour the settlement of some deposit feeders. Dense clam mats might stabilise the sediment and function as a sediment-trap for organic matter. Ensis directus has neither become a nuisance to other species nor developed according to the 'boom-and-bust' theory. The fate of the immigrant E. directus rather is a story of a successful trans-ocean invasion which still holds on 23 years after the first findings in the outer elbe estuary off Vogelsand.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Water Transparency Drives Intra-Population Divergence in Eurasian Perch (Perca fluviatilis)
AN  - 1326252192
AB  - Trait combinations that lead to a higher efficiency in resource utilization are important drivers of divergent natural selection and adaptive radiation. However, variation in environmental features might constrain foraging in complex ways and therefore impede the exploitation of critical resources. We tested the effect of water transparency on intra-population divergence in morphology of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) across seven lakes in central Sweden. Morphological divergence between near-shore littoral and open-water pelagic perch substantially increased with increasing water transparency. Reliance on littoral resources increased strongly with increasing water transparency in littoral populations, whereas littoral reliance was not affected by water transparency in pelagic populations. Despite the similar reliance on pelagic resources in pelagic populations along the water transparency gradient, the utilization of particular pelagic prey items differed with variation in water transparency in pelagic populations. Pelagic perch utilized cladocerans in lakes with high water transparency and copepods in lakes with low water transparency. We suggest that under impaired visual conditions low utilization of littoral resources by littoral perch and utilization of evasive copepods by pelagic perch may lead to changes in morphology. Our findings indicate that visual conditions can affect population divergence in predator populations through their effects on resource utilization.

T1  - First report on the importance of alien gobiids in the diet of native piscivorous fishes in the lower Vistula River (Poland)
AN  - 1366365732
AB  - We conducted a snapshot study to check the importance of non-native Ponto-Caspian gobies (monkey and racer goby) in the diet of native obligate (northern pike, pikeperch) and facultative (Eurasian perch) predators in the Vistula River 3-4 years after the appearance of aliens. In total 71 fish with non-empty stomachs, taken randomly from net catches from various parts of the river were analyzed, including 32 pike, 20 pikeperch and 19 perch specimens. We found that gobiids prevailed in the diet of smaller (<30 cm standard length, SL) individuals of pike and pikeperch, as well as larger (>15 cm SL) specimens of perch, although the effect of predator size on the presence of gobiids in the diet was not significant in the case of perch. Our results indicate that gobiids as a prey fish can stimulate considerable changes in local food webs, which require further studies.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Restoration Ecology:&nbsp;The New Frontier
AN  - 2131078601
AB  - Since 2006, when the first edition of this book appeared, major advances have taken place in restoration science and in the practice of ecological restoration. Both are now accepted as key components of the increasingly urgent search for sustainability at global, national, and community levels - hence the phrase 'New Frontier' in the title. 
While the first edition focused on ecosystems and landscapes in Europe, this new edition covers biomes and contexts all over the world. Several new chapters deal with broad issues such as biological invasions, climate change, and agricultural land abandonment as they relate to restoration science and ecological restoration. 
This is an accessible textbook for senior undergraduate and graduate level students, and early career scientists. The book also provides a solid scientific background for managers, volunteers, and mid-career professionals involved in the practice of ecological restoration.Since 2006, when the first edition of this book appeared, major advances have taken place in restoration science and in the practice of ecological restoration.

T1  - Highly Pathogenic Influenza A(H5N1) Virus Survival in Complex Artificial Aquatic Biotopes
AN  - 1324444493
AB  - Background 
Very little is known regarding the persistence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses in aquatic environments in tropical countries, although environmental materials have been suggested to play a role as reservoirs and sources of transmission for H5N1 viruses.
 Methodology/Principal Findings 
The survival of HPAI H5N1 viruses in experimental aquatic biotopes (water, mud, aquatic flora and fauna) relevant to field conditions in Cambodia was investigated. Artificial aquatic biotopes, including simple ones containing only mud and water, and complex biotopes involving the presence of aquatic flora and fauna, were set up. They were experimentally contaminated with H5N1 virus. The persistence of HPAI H5N1 virus (local avian and human isolates) was determined by virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs and by real-time reverse-polymerase chain reaction. Persistence of infectious virus did not exceed 4 days, and was only identified in rain water. No infectious virus particles were detected in pond and lake water or mud even when high inoculum doses were used. However, viral RNA persisted up to 20 days in rain water and 7 days in pond or lake water. Viral RNA was also detected in mud samples, up to 14 days post-contamination in several cases. Infectious virus and viral RNA was detected in few cases in the aquatic fauna and flora, especially in bivalves and labyrinth fish, although these organisms seemed to be mostly passive carriers of the virus rather than host allowing virus replication.
 Conclusions/Significance 
Although several factors for the survival and persistence of HPAI viruses in the environment are still to be elucidated, and are particularly hard to control in laboratory conditions, our results, along with previous data, support the idea that environmental surveillance is of major relevance for avian influenza control programs.

T1  - Dietary effects on fatty acid composition in muscle tissue of juvenile European eel, Anguilla anguilla (L.)
AN  - 921725958
AB  - The role of intracontinental migration patterns of European eel (Anguilla anguilla) receives more and more recognition in both ecological studies of the European eel and possible management measures, but small-scale patterns proved to be challenging to study. We experimentally investigated the suitability of fatty acid trophic markers to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats. Eight groups of juvenile European eels were fed on eight different diets in a freshwater recirculation system at 20°C for 56 days. Three groups were fed on freshwater diets (Rutilus rutilus, Chironomidae larvae, and Gammarus pulex) and four groups were reared on diets of a marine origin (Clupea harengus, Crangon crangon, Mysis spec., and Euphausia superba) and one on commercial pellets used in eel aquaculture. Fatty acid composition (FAC) of diets differed significantly with habitat. FAC of eel muscle tissue seemed to be rather insensitive to fatty acids supplied with diet, but the general pattern of lower n3:n6 and EPA:ARA ratios in freshwater prey organisms could be traced in the respective eels. Multivariate statistics of the fatty acid composition of the eels resulted in two distinct groups representing freshwater and marine treatments. Results further indicate the capability of selectively restraining certain fatty acids in eel, as e.g. the n3:n6 ratio in all treatments was <4, regardless of dietary n3:n6. In future studies on wild eel, these measures can be used to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats of individual European eel.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - First report on the importance of alien gobiids in the diet of native piscivorous fishes in the lower Vistula River (Poland)
AN  - 2811702972
AB  - We conducted a snapshot study to check the importance of non-native Ponto-Caspian gobies (monkey and racer goby) in the diet of native obligate (northern pike, pikeperch) and facultative (Eurasian perch) predators in the Vistula River 3–4 years after the appearance of aliens. In total 71 fish with non-empty stomachs, taken randomly from net catches from various parts of the river were analyzed, including 32 pike, 20 pikeperch and 19 perch specimens. We found that gobiids prevailed in the diet of smaller (<30 cm standard length, SL) individuals of pike and pikeperch, as well as larger (>15 cm SL) specimens of perch, although the effect of predator size on the presence of gobiids in the diet was not significant in the case of perch. Our results indicate that gobiids as a prey fish can stimulate considerable changes in local food webs, which require further studies.

T1  - Distribution patterns of invasive alien species in Alabama, USA
AN  - 2287017411
AB  - Invasive alien species (IAS) cause environmental and economical problems. How to effectively manage all IAS at a large area is a challenge. Hypotheses about IAS (such as the “human activity” hypothesis, the “biotic acceptance” and the “biotic resistance”) have been proposed from numerous studies. Here the state of Alabama in USA, widely occupied by IAS, is used as a case study for characterizing the emergent patterns of IAS. The results indicate that most IAS are located in metropolitan areas and in the Black Belt area which is a historical intensive land use area. There are positive relationships between the richness of IAS and the change of human population, the species richness and the number of endangered species, as well as the total road length and farmland area across Alabama. This study partially supports the above three hypotheses and provides a general pattern of local IAS. Based on possible processes related with IAS, some implications for strategically managing local IAS are discussed.

T1  - Assessing invasion process through pathway and vector analysis: case of saltcedar (Tamarix spp.)
AN  - 2287016577
AB  - Biological invasions are one of the most pervasive environmental threats to native ecosystems worldwide. The spontaneous spread of saltcedar is a particular threat to biodiversity conservation in arid and semiarid environments. In Argentina, three species belonging to this genus have been recognized as invaders. The aim of the present study was to identify main dispersal vectors and pathways to refine risk analysis and increase our ability to predict new areas at risk of Tamarix establishment. We surveyed and categorized 223 populations, 39% as invasive, 26% as established, 21% as contained and 14% as detected in nature . Dispersion of saltcedar was found to be associated with watercourses and human-driven disturbances; in addition roads were found to be relevant for the introduction of propagules in new environments. Considering the potential impact of saltcedar invasion and that it is an easily wind-dispersed invasive, it is necessary to implement strategies to monitor dispersal pathways and take actions to eliminate invasion foci, particularly in vulnerable and high-conservation value areas.

T1  - Tolerance to air exposure of the New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Hydrobiidae, Mollusca) as a prerequisite to survival in overland translocations
AN  - 2169926412
AB  - Spreading throughout a new ecosystem is the last step of an exotic species to become invasive. In the case of invasive aquatic molluscs, tolerance to air exposure is one of the main mechanisms allowing overland translocation and spreading. The mudsnail  Potamopyrgus antipodarum  ( Hydrobiidae, Mollusca) is native to New Zealand but it has spread worldwide, invading ecosystems in Europe, Australia, America and Asia. The aim of our study is to assess mudsnail tolerance to air exposure, which may contribute to the successful overland translocation of this species. We conducted a laboratory experiment with four levels of air exposure (9, 18, 24 and 36 hours in a controlled climatic chamber). Snails were placed for 60 seconds in a laboratory paper filter to remove surface snail water. Then they were placed back in empty vessels during the four periods of air exposure, except the control group, which was immediately returned to water. At the end of each period of air exposure all vessels were filled with water and the cumulative mortality was monitored after 24, 96, 168 and 264 hours of rehydration. The calculated Lethal Times (i. e. the time of air exposure (in hours) necessary to cause the death of 50% (LT50) or 99% (LT99) of the population) and their 95% confidence limits at 24, 96, 168 and 264 hours were 28.1 (25.2–31.9), 26.9 (24.2–30.1), 25.9 (23.4–28.9) and 25.9 (23.4–28.9) hours, respectively for LT50, and 49.6 (42.7–63.3), 45.6 (39.9–56.5), 43.2 (38.0–53.0) and 43.2 (38.0–53.0) hours, respectively for LT99. Therefore an air exposure time over 43 hours caused the death of all studied individuals during all monitoring periods. Extending the monitoring period beyond 24 hours did not significantly change lethal times. Therefore, we recommend exposing fishing tools or boats at open air during at least 53 hours as a low cost measure to control mudsnail spread in early stages of invasion.

T1  - Telomerase and Its Reverse Transcriptase Subunit TERT: Identification and Oestrogenic Modulation of Telomerase Transcription in Two Aquatic Test Species; European Purple Sea Urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) and Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
AN  - 1779544095
AB  - A plethora of naturally-produced steroid hormones, or artificial homologues of them, are being introduced into the aquatic and terrestrial environments each year. Two examples of these are the natural oestrogen 17β-oestradiol (E2) and the oestrogen receptor antagonist, Bisphenol A (BPA), both of which target the ribonucleoprotein telomerase through upregulation of its telomerase reverse transcriptase component, TERT. The main objectives of this study were firstly to isolate and characterize the actual mRNA sequence for the telomerase catalytic subuninit, Tert, in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) (Walbaum, 1792) and European purple sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) (Lamarck, 1816), with the aim of developing qPCR assays for the amplification and quantification of Tert. Further objectives were to use these assays in controlled exposure studies to establish whether and to what extent the aforementioned chemicals regulate Tert transcription and by doing so further understand the mechanism of Telomerase gene expression and the extent to which environmental oestrogen can interfere. The initial step of sequence characterization and assay devlopment was successful in the case of rainbow trout where two possible splice variants of Tert mRNA are identified, omTertShort and omTertLong. Two qPCR assays were developed for the relative quantification of both of these splice variants in rainbow trout samples, the latter of these successfully amplifying its target in test samples. In order to demonstrate in vitro and in vivo modulation of telomerase activity and mRNA expression, early life-stages of rainbow trout and purple sea urchin, as well as rainbow trout hepatocytes, were exposed to a range of concentrations of E2 and BPA. Purple sea urchin embryos were exposed to 200, 20 and 2 ng E2/ml for 28 hours until they had reached the stage of pluteus larvaes. Rainbow trout embryos were exposed to 500, 20 and 0.1 ng E2/ml and 600 and 150 ng BPA/ml for 167 days from immediately after fertilization. Rainbow trout hepatocytes were exposed to 20 and 2 ng E2/ml for 48 hours. The results from this study show that telomerase activity as well as TERT mRNA expression can be significantly modulated by exposure to oestrogens and other oestrogenic chemicals. E2 concentrations as low as 20 ng/ml lead to an increase in telomerase activity early-life stages of purple sea urchin and upregulation in the transcription of Tert mRNA in unhatched rainbow trout embryos. BPA induced similar response (600 ng/ml) in hatched rainbow trout alevins larvae. Very high exposures to E2 (500 ng/ml) do however lead to downregulation of Tert mRNA in hatched alevins larvae. Differential regulatory response can be observed between different tissue types of 167 day old fry, with an upregulatory response observed at 0.1 ng E2/ml in liver and muscle tissues, but not in brain. Similarly, brain tissues were observed expressing significantly less mRNA than liver and muscle samples when exposed to BPA (150 ng/ml). It is evident that the previously observed link between environmental oestrogens and telomerase is also present in the two test species examined; purple sea urchin and rainbow trout.

T1  - Potential effects of an invasive bivalve, Nuttallia obscurata, on biogeochemical cycling in the intertidal
AN  - 1515702600
AB  - The varnish clam, Nuttallia obscurata, is a rapidly spreading invasive species that can reach high densities (i.e. 800 individuals m-2). A three-tiered approach involving a field survey (Tier I), a density manipulation experiment (Tier II) and a microcosm experiment (Tier III) was applied to determine the effects of this invasive bivalve on biogeochemical cycling in the intertidal zone. At natural densities, bivalve distribution was best explained by sediment grain size. High densities of varnish clams did not significantly increase organic matter concentrations; although their ability to deposit feed and bioturbational activities may have prevented accumulations. High densities of varnish clams resulted in significantly higher concentrations of ammonium and percent silt. Nitrogen is a limiting nutrient with ammonium preferentially used by phytoplankton and microphytobenthos. These primary producers form the basis of all marine food webs; thus, changes in the concentration and flux of ammonium may impact ecosystem functioning of the intertidal area.   Keywords: Nuttallia obscurata, invasive bivalves, intertidal, nitrogen, biogeochemical cycling.

T1  - Genetic relationships of wild pigs (Sus scrofa) in the United States: Geographic origins and genotypic distribution of the species with implications for management
AN  - 1030959114
AB  - Wild pigs are a damaging invasive species with a long history in the United States. However, during the last 30 years wild pigs have drastically expanded their invasive range and are now present in 44 U.S. states. Though historic records provide insights regarding original introduction histories in areas where pigs are long-established, little is known regarding sources for new populations. To develop a better understanding of recent invasions, I utilized an array of molecular markers (mitochondrial DNA sequence, nuclear microsatellites, and nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms) to evaluate both the evolutionary history of introduced pigs and gene flow between populations indicative of dispersal pathways.    Mitochondrial sequence provided a basal understanding of pig invasions (i.e., geographic origins and breed associations) through evaluation of U.S. pigs in context of published sequence from around the world. However, mitochondrial relationships must be considered cautiously, as introduction sources can be obscured due to shared ancestry between Eurasian wild boar and domestic pigs and the ubiquity of some haplotypes in national and global datasets.    With microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms, I identified multiple genetic groupings that corresponded to geographic distributions and known introduction histories. Through individual and population genetic distance analyses, I found that dispersal patterns and sources for invasions of wild pigs can be identified using molecular techniques. I also identified an isolation by distance relationship at the national level and in California, which suggests that range expansion can be tracked in terms of gene flow across the landscape. However, my results did not resolve whether the association of genetic distance with geographic distance has resulted from diminishing rates of gene flow under a natural dispersal scenario or from genetic drift associated with anthropogenic dispersal; evidence of both pathways for pig invasion was apparent in my dataset. Further, landscape genetic analyses suggested some role for natural dispersal in range expansion in California.    My findings here suggest that ongoing research in the area of wild pig genetics would be productive. Additional samples from throughout the United States will be necessary to further resolve population genetic relationships and the role of anthropogenic and natural dispersal in range expansion.

T1  - Viral Replication, Persistence in Water and Genetic Characterization of Two Influenza A Viruses Isolated from Surface Lake Water
AN  - 1310006519
AB  - Water-borne transmission has been suggested as an important transmission mechanism for Influenza A (IA) viruses in wild duck populations; however, relatively few studies have attempted to detect IA viruses from aquatic habitats. Water-isolated viruses have rarely been genetically characterized and evaluation for persistence in water and infectivity in natural hosts has never been documented. In this study, we focused on two IA viruses (H3N8 and H4N6 subtypes) isolated from surface lake water in Minnesota, USA. We investigated the relative prevalence of the two virus subtypes in wild duck populations at the sampling site and their genetic relatedness to IA viruses isolated in wild waterbirds in North America. Viral persistence under different laboratory conditions (temperature and pH) and replication in experimentally infected Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were also characterized. Both viruses were the most prevalent subtype one year following their isolation in lake water. The viruses persisted in water for an extended time period at constant temperature (several weeks) but infectivity rapidly reduced under multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Furthermore, the two isolates efficiently replicated in Mallards. The complete genome characterization supported that these isolates originated from genetic reassortments with other IA viruses circulating in wild duck populations during the year of sampling. Based on phylogenetic analyses, we couldn't identify genetically similar viruses in duck populations in the years following their isolation from lake water. Our study supports the role for water-borne transmission for IA viruses but also highlights that additional field and experimental studies are required to support inter-annual persistence in aquatic habitats.

T1  - An Exotic Species Is the Favorite Prey of a Native Enemy
AN  - 1308442079
AB  - Although native enemies in an exotic species' new range are considered to affect its ability to invade, few studies have evaluated predation pressures from native enemies on exotic species in their new range. The exotic prey naiveté hypothesis (EPNH) states that exotic species may be at a disadvantage because of its naïveté towards native enemies and, therefore, may suffer higher predation pressures from the enemy than native prey species. Corollaries of this hypothesis include the native enemy preferring exotic species over native species and the diet of the enemy being influenced by the abundance of the exotic species. We comprehensively tested this hypothesis using introduced North American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus, referred to as bullfrog), a native red-banded snake (Dinodon rufozonatum, the enemy) and four native anuran species in permanent still water bodies as a model system in Daishan, China. We investigated reciprocal recognition between snakes and anuran species (bullfrogs and three common native species) and the diet preference of the snakes for bullfrogs and the three species in laboratory experiments, and the diet preference and bullfrog density in the wild. Bullfrogs are naive to the snakes, but the native anurans are not. However, the snakes can identify bullfrogs as prey, and in fact, prefer bullfrogs over the native anurans in manipulative experiments with and without a control for body size and in the wild, indicating that bullfrogs are subjected to higher predation pressures from the snakes than the native species. The proportion of bullfrogs in the snakes' diet is positively correlated with the abundance of bullfrogs in the wild. Our results provide strong evidence for the EPNH. The results highlight the biological resistance of native enemies to naïve exotic species.

T1  - Assessing the Relationship Between Propagule Pressure and Invasion Risk in Ballast Water
AN  - 2131358203
AB  - The human-mediated introduction of species to regions of the world they could never reach by natural means has had great impacts on the environment, the economy, and society. In the ocean, these invasions have long been mediated by the uptake and subsequent release of ballast water in ocean-going vessels. Increasing world trade and a concomitantly growing global shipping fleet composed of larger and faster vessels, combined with a series of prominent ballast-mediated invasions over the past two decades, have prompted active national and international interest in ballast water management. 
Assessing the Relationship Between Propagule Pressure and Invasion Risk in Ballast Water informs the regulation of ballast water by helping the Environnmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) better understand the relationship between the concentration of living organisms in ballast water discharges and the probability of nonindigenous organisms successfully establishing populations in U.S. waters. The report evaluates the risk-release relationship in the context of differing environmental and ecological conditions, including estuarine and freshwater systems as well as the waters of the three-mile territorial sea. It recommends how various approaches can be used by regulatory agencies to best inform risk management decisions on the allowable concentrations of living organisms in discharged ballast water in order to safeguard against the establishment of new aquatic nonindigenous species, and to protect and preserve existing indigenous populations of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and other beneficial uses of the nation's waters. 
Assessing the Relationship Between Propagule Pressure and Invasion Risk in Ballast Water provides valuable information that can be used by federal agencies, such as the EPA, policy makers, environmental scientists, and researchers.

T1  - Human Ecology of a Species Introduction: Interactions Between Humans and Introduced Green Iguanas in a Puerto Rican Urban Estuary
AN  - 871504683
AB  - This paper reports results of interdisciplinary research between anthropologists and wildlife ecologists about the interactions between people and introduced green iguanas (Iguana iguana) in the San Juan Bay Estuary in Puerto Rico. Non-indigenous, introduced species and their impact on invaded ecosystems, including humans, are a worldwide environmental concern. Humans are the dominant species in most world ecosystems, and, thus, studying an introduced species' interactions with people is of utmost importance to understand its impacts, make predictions, and inform environmental policy. Here, we detail some remarkable findings of our ongoing research in this topic, including (1) the spatial distribution of introduced green iguanas with respect to people's activities and land uses, (2) the intracultural variation in attitudes and values regarding introduced iguanas and other introduced species in the study region, (3) local people's knowledge about iguana diets in the estuary, and (4) the interactions between green iguanas and the tourism industry in Puerto Rico.

T1  - Invasive and Introduced Plants and Animals:&nbsp;Human Perceptions, Attitudes and Approaches to Management
AN  - 2131985371
AB  - There have been many well-publicized cases of invasive species of plants and animals, often introduced unintentionally but sometimes on purpose, causing widespread ecological havoc. Examples of such alien invasions include pernicious weeds such as Japanese knotweed, an introduced garden ornamental which can grow through concrete, the water hyacinth which has choked tropical waterways, and many introduced animals which have out-competed and displaced local fauna. This book addresses the broader context of invasive and exotic species, in terms of the perceived threats and environmental concerns which surround alien species and ecological invasions. As a result of unprecedented scales of environmental change, combined with rapid globalisation, the mixing of cultures and diversity, and fears over biosecurity and bioterrorism, the known impacts of particular invasions have been catastrophic. However, as several chapters show, reactions to some exotic species, and the justifications for interventions in certain situations, including biological control by introduced natural enemies, rest uncomfortably with social reactions to ethnic cleansing and persecution perpetrated across the globe. The role of democracy in deciding and determining environmental policy is another emerging issue. In an increasingly multicultural society this raises huge questions of ethics and choice. At the same time, in order to redress major ecological losses, the science of reintroduction of native species has also come to the fore, and is widely accepted by many in nature conservation. However, with questions of where and when, and with what species or even species analogues, reintroductions are acceptable, the topic is hotly debated. Again, it is shown that many decisions are based on values and perceptions rather than objective science. Including a wide range of case studies from around the world, his book raises critical issues to stimulate a much wider debate.

T1  - Encyclopedia of Fish Physiology:&nbsp;From Genome to Environment
AN  - 2133050800
AB  - Fish form an extremely diverse group of vertebrates. At a conservative estimate at least 40% of the world's vertebrates are fish. On the one hand they are united by their adaptations to an aquatic environment and on the other they show a variety of adaptations to differing environmental conditions - often to extremes of temperature, salinity, oxygen level and water chemistry. They exhibit an array of behavioural and reproductive systems. Interesting in their own right, this suite of adaptive physiologies provides many model systems for both comparative vertebrate and human physiologists. 
This four volume encyclopedia covers the diversity of fish physiology in over 300 articles and provides entry level information for students and summary overviews for researchers alike. 
Broadly organised into four themes, articles cover Functional, Thematic, and Phylogenetic Physiology, and Fish Genomics 
Functional articles address the traditional aspects of fish physiology that are common to all areas of vertebrate physiology including: Reproduction, Respiration, Neural (Sensory, Central, Effector), Endocrinology, Renal, Cardiovascular, Acid-base Balance, Osmoregulation, Ionoregulation, Digestion, Metabolism, Locomotion, and so on. 
Thematic Physiology articles are carefully selected and fewer in number. They provide a level of integration that goes beyond the coverage in the Functional Physiology topics and include discussions of Toxicology, Air-breathing, Migrations, Temperature, Endothermy, etc. 
Phylogenetic Physiology articles bring together information that bridges the physiology of certain groupings of fishes where the knowledge base has a sufficient depth and breadth and include articles on Ancient Fishes, Tunas, Sharks, etc. 
Genomics articles describe the underlying genetic component of fish physiology and high light their suitability and use as model organisms for the study of disease, stress and physiological adaptations and reactions to external conditions.

T1  - Using Maximum Entropy Modeling for Optimal Selection of Sampling Sites for Monitoring Networks
AN  - 1524240488
AB  - Environmental monitoring programs must efficiently describe state shifts. We propose using maximum entropy modeling to select dissimilar sampling sites to capture environmental variability at low cost, and demonstrate a specific application: sample site selection for the Central Plains domain (453,490 km2) of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). We relied on four environmental factors: mean annual temperature and precipitation, elevation, and vegetation type. A "sample site" was defined as a 20 km × 20 km area (equal to NEON's airborne observation platform [AOP] footprint), within which each 1 km2 cell was evaluated for each environmental factor. After each model run, the most environmentally dissimilar site was selected from all potential sample sites. The iterative selection of eight sites captured approximately 80% of the environmental envelope of the domain, an improvement over stratified random sampling and simple random designs for sample site selection. This approach can be widely used for cost-efficient selection of survey and monitoring sites.

T1  - Evaluating the Potential Efficacy of Invasive Lionfish (Pterois volitans) Removals
AN  - 1295065715
AB  - The lionfish, Pterois volitans (Linnaeus) and Pterois miles (Bennett), invasion of the Western Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico has the potential to alter aquatic communities and represents a legitimate ecological concern. Several local removal programs have been initiated to control this invasion, but it is not known whether removal efforts can substantially reduce lionfish numbers to ameliorate these concerns. We used an age-structured population model to evaluate the potential efficacy of lionfish removal programs and identified critical data gaps for future studies. We used high and low estimates for uncertain parameters including: length at 50% vulnerability to harvest (Lvul), instantaneous natural mortality (M), and the Goodyear compensation ratio (CR). The model predicted an annual exploitation rate between 35 and 65% would be required to cause recruitment overfishing on lionfish populations for our baseline parameter estimates for M and CR (0.5 and 15). Lionfish quickly recovered from high removal rates, reaching 90% of unfished biomass six years after a 50-year simulated removal program. Quantifying lionfish natural mortality and the size-selective vulnerability to harvest are the most important knowledge gaps for future research. We suggest complete eradication of lionfish through fishing is unlikely, and substantial reduction of adult abundance will require a long-term commitment and may be feasible only in small, localized areas where annual exploitation can be intense over multiple consecutive years.

T1  - Gene Expression Rhythms in the Mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lam.) across an Annual Cycle
AN  - 1294948400
AB  - Seasonal environmental changes may affect the physiology of Mytilus galloprovincialis (Lam.), an intertidal filter-feeder bivalve occurring commonly in Mediterranean and Atlantic coastal areas. We investigated seasonal variations in relative transcript abundance of the digestive gland and the mantle (gonads) of males and females. To identify gene expression trends – in terms of relative mRNA abundance- we used a medium-density cDNA microarray (1.7 K probes) in dual-color competitive hybridization analyses. Hierarchical clustering of digestive gland microarray data showed two main branches, distinguishing profiles associated with the “hot” months (May–August) from the other months. Genes involved in chitin metabolism, associated with mussel nutrition and digestion showed higher mRNA levels during summer. Moreover, we found different gene transcriptomic patterns in the digestive glands of males when compared to females, during the four stages of mussel gonadal development. Microarray data from gonadal transcripts also displayed clear patterns during the different developmental phases respect to the resting period (stage I) with peak relative mRNA abundance at the ripe phase (stage III) for both sexes. These data showed a clear temporal pattern in transcriptomic profiles of mussels sampled over an annual cycle. Physiological response to thermal variation, food availability, and reproductive status across months may contribute to variation in relative mRNA abundance.

T1  - GIS Applications in Agriculture, Volume Three:&nbsp;Invasive Species
AN  - 2136215402
AB  - While many alien plant and animal species are purposefully introduced into new areas as ornamentals, livestock, crops, and even pets, these species can escape into other areas and threaten agricultural and native ecosystems causing economic and environmental harm, or harm to human health. Increasingly, scientists are using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to track and manage the invaders, mitigate the potential rate of spread and level of impact, and protect the native economy and ecosystem. Beginning with an introduction to the use of GIS technology to capture, store, analyze, manage, and present data, GIS Applications in Agriculture, Volume Three: Invasive Species examines five relevant categories of geographic information including dispersal and transport, prediction and forecasting, mapping of current infestations, maps for management and control tactics, and impact assessment and method of control. It address GIS for studying the population ecology of a new species, niche requirements for species success, and the monitoring and control of several different species including Australian examples of intentionally introduced invasive species, insects and other animals that may also vector a disease, and invasive weed management from prediction to management. Chapters cover maps and imageries available on various Web sites and provide step-by-step tutorials or case studies that allow manipulation of datasets featured on the accompanying CD-ROM to make maps, perform statistical analyses, and predict future problems. It offers hands-on experience with a variety of software programs that create interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze spatial information, edit data and maps, and present the results of these operations in several different formats. Some of the programs are freeware, others are not, but each can be used to integrate, edit, share, and display geographic information. Color figures are also available on the CD-ROM.

T1  - A Characterization of the Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, and Benthic Invertebrate Communities of Lake Elsinore
AN  - 918687511
AB  - Lake Elsinore is a shallow, polymictic lake in the southwest corner of Riverside County in Southern California. It has a history of poor water quality (algal blooms, low DO, and periodic fish kills) and was listed on the State of California's 303d list for impairments due to nutrients and other factors.  Water column measurements and nutrient concentrations have been closely monitored since 2000.  Less is known about the biological condition of the lake. A 1-yr biological monitoring study was conducted in 2010 to quantify the abundance, diversity, and richness of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates in Lake Elsinore.  This report summarizes the results of that study and also includes findings from an experiment to determine the response of the phytoplankton community to nutrient inputs.     The phytoplankton community exhibited very strong variation in Simpson's diversity (∼0.2 −0.8) and biomass (∼2,000 −30,000 mg m −3) during the study period.  The lowest diversities and highest biomasses occurred during the 2010 summer bloom of Pseudanabaena limnetica .  The highest diversities and lower overall phytoplankton biomasses occurred during winter and spring of 2010 when green algae and/or diatoms were a prominent component of the biomass.   The zooplankton community was comprised primarily of smaller zooplankters with rotifers dominating summer through fall and cyclopoid copepods being more prominent during cooler seasons.  Large cladocerans were scarce and only found early in 2010 after heavy rainfall caused Canyon Lake to spill over into Lake Elsinore.     The benthic community was the most impoverished, consisting predominantly of organisms (Chironomids and Ilyocryptus) with red hemoglobin-like pigments that aid in the binding and transfer of oxygen.  This reflects the low DO concentrations in the bottom waters and sediments of Lake Elsinore during much of the year.  Invertebrate densities varied strongly between sites and sampling dates and were consistently higher at the shallower sites with higher DO and lower organic carbon concentrations in the sediments.     Results from the nutrient addition experiment suggest that phytoplankton were mainly N-limited, but that the diatoms were limited mostly by P.  They also suggest that an excess of N relative to P contributes to the formation of Pseudanabaena limnetica blooms.

T1  - Ocean Connectivity and Nearshore Marine Species Population Dynamics
AN  - 896482125
AB  - This dissertation addresses the spatial dynamics of marine species in nearshore environments. These are some of the most productive and diverse regions on earth, providing essential goods and services to a large number of people around the globe. However, they are also under increasing stress from numerous perturbations such as oil spills, over-harvesting, and from changes in our atmospheric and oceanic climates. These disturbances are but a few examples for why it is important that we develop our understanding, and have some predictive capacity for the population dynamics of nearshore marine species. This is no trivial task for nearshore systems are complex, being characterized by interacting physical, ecological and social processes, and it is often difficult to understand why certain species are where, and how they might respond to certain management actions. Nevertheless, this has been the focus on my Ph. D., specifically, I have studied the role that ocean circulation plays in the demography of nearshore marine species. Most nearshore marine species are sedentary as adults, with home ranges ∼ 10 km. It is as newly spawned larvae that they travel greater distances, sometimes traveling hundreds of kilometers. During this stage, dispersal is primarily directed by ocean currents, and as a result, these species exist in a complex system of connected subpopulations. This spatial connectivity is the heart of my dissertation. I have worked on answering four research questions that each have a focus on connectivity: (1) what do patterns of larval connectivity look like in the Southern California Bight? (2) is connectivity important for the robustness of nearshore metapopulations and their management? (3) does connectivity change in time and, if so, what are the demographic consequences? (4) does connectivity in uence the composition of species in nearshore communities?

T1  - The Impacts of Chemical Discharges on the Reproductive Biology of the Bullhead Cottus Gobio and the Dipper Cinclus Cinclus in the Tamar Catchment
AN  - 1033193020
AB  - It is now well established that a wide range of natural and anthropogenic chemicals present in the aquatic environment have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system of many organisms. In fish, many of these effects appear to be of a feminising nature, including stimulation of vitellogenin production and induction of intersex. In piscivorous birds these so called endocrine disrupting contaminants have been shown to impair reproduction, influencing reproductive behaviour, sex ratio, eggshell thickness and reproductive success. The effects seen in fish have been associated with high levels of oestrogenic activity in the effluent from waste water treatments works (WwTWs), but few studies have focused on the effects of WwTWs effluents on birds.In this thesis, the effects of effluents from WwTWs on fish and birds were investigated in the Tamar catchment, SW England. The work spanned making detailed assessment on the oestrogenic and anti-androgenic activity of 3 WwTWs effluents, using a variety of water sampling techniques and applying both recombinant yeast oestrogen screen (YES) and recombinant yeast androgen screen (anti-YAS) bioassays to quantify the different hormonal activities. A survey was undertaken of the hormonal activities at 13 sites to determine concentrations of contaminants in the surface waters throughout the Tamar catchment, using both recombinant yeast screens and targeted analytical chemistry for specific pollutants (LC/MS-TOF and GCMS). An ELISA was developed to quantify vitellogenin (VTG) in the bullhead (our study fish sentinel) as a biomarker of oestrogen exposure, and evidence of endocrine disruption was investigated in wild populations of the bullhead, Cottus gobio and the dipper, Cinclus cinclus. Macroinvertebrates from upstream and downstream of three WwTW's effluent discharges and from three sampling sites were also sampled as an index of overall water quality in the Tamar catchment, and as an assessment of food availability for the bullheads and dippers.For the studies on the hormonal activities in three WwTWs in the Tamar catchment, samples were collected by both spot and passive sampling; passive samplers (in replicate) were placed in the effluent discharges for a three week period, and collected on days 7, 14 and 21, spot samples were taken simultaneously. Measurement of total oestrogenic and total anti-androgenic activity was conducted using the YES and antiYAS, respectively. Spot and passive samples were collected from 13 sites within the Tamar catchment (sampling sites were >2 km downstream of effluent discharges). Additionally, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry time-of-flight (LC/MS-TOF) was used to measure the concentration of oestrone (E1), 17β-oestrodiol (E2) and 17αethinylestradiol (EE2) in each sample. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) was used to measure the concentration of individual PBDE and PCB congeners in the spot samples only.Levels of oestrogenic and anti-androgenic activity observed in the WwTWs effluent were comparable with those measured in effluents in the UK and in other countries. Surface waters of the Tamar, away from the WwTWs effluent discharges, contained very little oestrogenic activity (<1.1 ng E2 EQs L -1), and anti-androgenic activity was undetectable. Quantification of oestrogenic activity using passive samplers showed an increasing amount of total oestrogenic activity between days 7 and 21 when measured by the both the YES and LC/MS-TOF.

T1  - Impact of contaminant exposure on resource contests in an invasive fish
AN  - 872074334
AB  - There is increasing concern for the disruptive effects seen in aquatic species exposed to environmental contaminants. However, few studies have investigated the impact of such contaminants on the behavior of individuals living in exposed waters. Contaminant exposure can affect animal populations by disrupting behaviors including feeding, locomotion, and mating. In this study, we examined how living in an ecosystem polluted by combinations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, iron, lead, zinc) impacts contest behavior in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Fish collected from heavily contaminated and cleaner sites in Lake Ontario were subjected to a resource contest to determine the effect of these contaminants on aggression and the establishment of dominance hierarchies, which in turn influence access to food, shelter, and mating opportunities. Dominance establishment (a clear resource winner) was less obvious among fish from the contaminated site compared to the more stable hierarchies that formed between pairs of fish from the clean site. Pairs of fish from the contaminated site performed more assessment displays compared to fish from clean sites. These results suggest that the costs of living in an environment under exposure can shape behavioral repertoires. The altered conflict resolution strategies of contaminated fish may reflect impaired cognitive function, sensory perception, and/or higher metabolic load associated with aggression. This study provides support for the utilization of quantifiable behavioral differences as ecologically relevant measures of contaminant exposure.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessment of Blue Mussel Mytilus edulis Fisheries and Waterbird Shellfish-predator Management in the Danish Wadden Sea
AN  - 856979331; 21090002
AB  - We assessed the blue mussel Mytilus edulis fishery management scheme introduced in 1994 in the Danish Wadden Sea that regulate fishing vessels, fishery quota, set-aside for mussel-eating birds and established zones closed to mussel fishery. The results showed (i) a reduction in the blue mussel biomass and mussel bed areas in zones closed to fishery, (ii) decrease in eiders Somateria mollissima numbers and increase or stable numbers for oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and herring gull Larus argentatus and (iii) that energy estimations based on ecological food requirements for the mussel-eating birds should be at least three times larger, than the amount set-aside in the mussel management scheme. It is concluded that the mussel management scheme had been unable to stabilize or increase the blue mussel stocks and to secure stable or increasing numbers for all target bird species. Thus, it is recommended to revise the present blue mussel management scheme in the Danish Wadden Sea, to continue and improve mussel stock and bird surveys, and to consider novel studies of the mussel-eating birds' energetics for improved set-aside estimates and future assessments.

T1  - Native Dreissena freshwater mussels in the Balkans: in and out of ancient lakes
AN  - 762470614
AB  - The Balkans is a biogeographically highly diverse region and a worldwide hotspot of endemic freshwater diversity. A substantial part of this diversity is attributed to well recognized and potential ancient lakes in its southwestern part. However, despite considerable research efforts, faunal relationships among those lakes are not well understood. Therefore, genetic information from native representatives of the mussel genus Dreissena is here used to test the biogeographical zonation of the southwestern Balkans, to relate demographic changes to environmental changes, to assess the degree of eco-insularity, to reconstruct their evolutionary history, and to explore the potential of native taxa for becoming invasive.              Phylogeographical and population genetic analyses indicate that most studied populations belong to two native species: D. presbensis (including the distinct genetic subgroup from Lake Ohrid, "D. stankovici") and D. blanci. In addition, the first confirmed record of invasive D. polymorpha in the southwestern Balkan is presented.              The distribution of native Dreissena spp. generally coincides with the biogeographical zonations previously suggested based on fish data. However, there is disagreement on the assignment of the ancient lakes in the area to respective biogeographical regions. The data for Lake Ohrid are not conclusive. A closer biogeographical connection to lakes of the Vardar region and possibly the northern Ionian region is, however, suggested for Lake Prespa.              The reconstruction of the evolutionary history of Dreissena spp. suggests that populations underwent demographic and spatial expansions in the recent past. Expansions started around 320 000-300 000 years ago in "D. stankovici", 160 000-140 000 years ago in D. blanci, and 110 000-70 000 years ago in D. presbensis. These time frames are discussed within the context of available paleogeological data for lakes Ohrid and Prespa. It is suggested that regional environmental changes may have had pronounced effects on the population histories of native Dreissena spp., though the high buffer capacity of Lake Ohrid may have lessened these effects in "D. stankovici". In addition, local events influencing individual lakes had very likely considerable effects on the demographic histories of Dreissena spp. as well. The observed patterns of immigration and emigration in and out of ancient lakes may suggest that limited gene flow enabled the survival of few isolated subpopulations and that later on eco-insularity (selective advantages of locally adopted groups) may have prevented excessive hybridization and sympatry of closely related taxa.              As for the potential invasiveness of native Dreissena spp., the inferred spatial expansions are not human-mediated and all taxa still appear to be restricted to their native ranges. A concern, however, is that today D. presbensis and D. blanci also occur in artificial water bodies, and that invasive D. polymorpha has reached the area.

T1  - Diversity and Impact of Prokaryotic Toxins on Aquatic Environments: A Review
AN  - 1537941683
AB  - Microorganisms are ubiquitous in all habitats and are recognized by their metabolic versatility and ability to produce many bioactive compounds, including toxins. Some of the most common toxins present in water are produced by several cyanobacterial species. As a result, their blooms create major threats to animal and human health, tourism, recreation and aquaculture. Quite a few cyanobacterial toxins have been described, including hepatotoxins, neurotoxins, cytotoxins and dermatotoxins. These toxins are secondary metabolites, presenting a vast diversity of structures and variants. Most of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites are peptides or have peptidic substructures and are assumed to be synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS), involving peptide synthetases, or NRPS/PKS, involving peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases hybrid pathways. Besides cyanobacteria, other bacteria associated with aquatic environments are recognized as significant toxin producers, representing important issues in food safety, public health, and human and animal well being. Vibrio species are one of the most representative groups of aquatic toxin producers, commonly associated with seafood-born infections. Some enterotoxins and hemolysins have been identified as fundamental for V. cholerae and V. vulnificus pathogenesis, but there is evidence for the existence of other potential toxins. Campylobacter spp. and Escherichia coli are also water contaminants and are able to produce important toxins after infecting their hosts. Other bacteria associated with aquatic environments are emerging as toxin producers, namely Legionella pneumophila and Aeromonas hydrophila, described as responsible for the synthesis of several exotoxins, enterotoxins and cytotoxins. Furthermore, several Clostridium species can produce potent neurotoxins. Although not considered aquatic microorganisms, they are ubiquitous in the environment and can easily contaminate drinking and irrigation water. Clostridium members are also spore-forming bacteria and can persist in hostile environmental conditions for long periods of time, contributing to their hazard grade. Similarly, Pseudomonas species are widespread in the environment. Since P. aeruginosa is an emergent opportunistic pathogen, its toxins may represent new hazards for humans and animals. This review presents an overview of the diversity of toxins produced by prokaryotic microorganisms associated with aquatic habitats and their impact on environment, life and health of humans and other animals. Moreover, important issues like the availability of these toxins in the environment, contamination sources and pathways, genes involved in their biosynthesis and molecular mechanisms of some representative toxins are also discussed.

T1  - Status of Biodiversity in the Baltic Sea
AN  - 1292343948
AB  - The brackish Baltic Sea hosts species of various origins and environmental tolerances. These immigrated to the sea 10,000 to 15,000 years ago or have been introduced to the area over the relatively recent history of the system. The Baltic Sea has only one known endemic species. While information on some abiotic parameters extends back as long as five centuries and first quantitative snapshot data on biota (on exploited fish populations) originate generally from the same time, international coordination of research began in the early twentieth century. Continuous, annual Baltic Sea-wide long-term datasets on several organism groups (plankton, benthos, fish) are generally available since the mid-1950s. Based on a variety of available data sources (published papers, reports, grey literature, unpublished data), the Baltic Sea, incl. Kattegat, hosts altogether at least 6,065 species, including at least 1,700 phytoplankton, 442 phytobenthos, at least 1,199 zooplankton, at least 569 meiozoobenthos, 1,476 macrozoobenthos, at least 380 vertebrate parasites, about 200 fish, 3 seal, and 83 bird species. In general, but not in all organism groups, high sub-regional total species richness is associated with elevated salinity. Although in comparison with fully marine areas the Baltic Sea supports fewer species, several facets of the system's diversity remain underexplored to this day, such as micro-organisms, foraminiferans, meiobenthos and parasites. In the future, climate change and its interactions with multiple anthropogenic forcings are likely to have major impacts on the Baltic biodiversity.

T1  - Zebra mussels near our waters
AN  - 608163305
AB  - "This does increase the risk that zebra mussels will enter eventually into Manitoba's waterways," Wendy Ralley, a water-quality specialist with Manitoba Water Stewardship, said.              The province has been bracing for their arrival since the early 1990s but Ralley said she can't estimate how long it will be before the zebra mussels reach Manitoba, adding the province is stepping up its public education campaign with boaters.              Ralley said it's believed our cold weather will restrict the zebra mussel invasion of Manitoba to our southern water. Female zebra mussels can only produce eggs in water 12 C or warmer.

AB  - A Great Lakes Blueprint: a Canadian Vision for Protecting and Restoring the  Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River Ecosystem was published in 2007 by EcoJustice, Sierra Club of Canada, Great Lakes United and several other groups. It gives Canadians a better understanding of the underlying reasons for deep concern for one of the largest ecosystems in the world. Invasive species have altered the Great lakes ecosystem and continue to do so with tragic consequences. The Asian Carp is now only six miles from Lake Michigan.  See Great Lakes United website, www.glu.org for more information. Electric barriers and poison have not stopped this huge predator so far, and scientists believe that the $4.5 billion dollar fishing industry would be devastated if the carp infiltrate the Great Lakes. This is not the first time that that the Great Lakes have been threatened. The  rainbow trout, white perch, sea lamprey, pacific salmon smelt, zebra and quagga mussels, round goby, alewife, Chinook salmon,  brown trout spiny water flea  are just a few of the 180 invasive species that were either intentionally brought to the lakes or came by other means such as by ship ballast water, Add climate change, pollutants, a lack of effective governance, poor sewage infrastructure and water quality plus ineffective public participation, and this glacial treasure can easily become a watery wasteland.

T1  - Another view: Healing the Great Lakes
AN  - 267318983
AB  - The benchmarks outlined in the "action plan" for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative gives you a graphic view of the lakes' parlous state.                The declared goals include removing or preventing the dumping of 45 million pounds of discarded computers and other "e-waste," 45 million "pills of unwanted medicines" and 4.5 million pounds of household hazardous waste.               The plan would restore coastal wetlands and curb pollution runoff from farms and homes. It also seeks to halt the spread of invasive species like quagga and zebra mussels and a newcomer, the Asian carp, which is looming just a canal's length away.

T1  - An assessment of the presence and fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) found in treated wastewater discharges into Charleston Harbor, South Carolina
AN  - 857215983
AB  - Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are a group of contaminants of emerging concern that are introduced into aquatic environments by non-point and point sources. This study assessed seasonal/regional trends of targeted PPCPs detected in samples from two local wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and surface water from the Charleston Harbor over twelve months. After modifying EPA Method 1694 to include hormones, analysis using HPLC/MS/MS revealed that of the 19 target compounds examined, 11 were quantified above method reporting limits in wastewater influent, 9 in effluent, and 7 in surface water samples. Concentrations were reduced by > 90% for most chemicals in effluent compared to influent, though concentrations of some PPCPs in effluent were higher than those in influent. Differences in effluent concentrations and estimated removal between WWTPs are believed to be related to variation in general operating parameters and/or the anoxic basin employed by one of the facilities. Laboratory experiments also examined the effects of salinity on PPCP recovery/degradation and PPCP effects on oxygen uptake in Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica ) gill tissue. Results indicate that there may be little to no risk for acute effects on non-target organisms, though further testing of sublethal exposures and/or mixtures is warranted. Overall, future monitoring of PPCPs may aid in minimizing potential negative impacts of increasing urban/industrial development in coastal regions.

T1  - Stable nitrogen isotopes (delta-nitrogen-15) in the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) as an indicator of nitrogen source
AN  - 762373910
AB  - This dissertation demonstrates that stable nitrogen isotope signatures (δ15N) in oysters (Crassostrea virginica) can identify anthropogenic nitrogen sources (a cause of degraded water quality) at multiple spatial scales in Chesapeake Bay and Maryland’s Coastal Bays. Fieldwork, monitoring and land use data, spatial analyses, and modeling techniques were employed. Due to minimal tissue ä15N variations between individuals as replicates (standard error < 0.5 ‰), a sample size of five individuals optimally balanced error with effort. Transplantation verified convergence of oyster δ15N after changes in nitrogen source while modeling quantified temporal integration (four months for muscle, two to three months for gill and mantle) and measurements over two years demonstrated seasonal δ 15N increases in seston (summer) and oysters (winter). At the small scale (10s of km2), oyster tissues in Monie Bay’s creeks (varying by watershed land use) were dominated by anthropogenic nitrogen transported to Monie Bay from Wicomico River whose watershed inputs were predominantly manures (6.8 × 104 to 2.4 × 106 kg N yr-1), not sewage (2.0 × 105 kg N yr-1) or septic (1.1 × 105 kg N yr -1). This has large implications for Delmarva Peninsula: home to 4,630 poultry feeding houses (generating 3.9 × 106 to 1.3 × 108 kg N yr-1) and 1.2 × 106 people (combined sewage and septic generating 3.7 × 106 kg N yr-1), thus a poultry:human nitrogen generation ratio of 1:1 to 91:1. At the medium spatial scale (100s of km2), water quality in Maryland's Coastal Bays was susceptible to runoff. Macroalgae δ 15N (Gracilaria sp.) responded rapidly (4 days) over 100s of km2, while oyster δ15N responded slowly (2 months) over 10s of km2. Broadly, in Chesapeake Bay (large scale, 10,000s of km2), oyster δ15 N was correlated to land use, stream and tributary water quality, and it reflected tributary wastewater plumes. The overall oyster δ 15N gradient (16.0‰ in Eastern Bay, 8.3‰ in Lynnhaven River) decreased with flushing time, with increased salinity, and with increased shell height. Denitrification remains potentially confounding as it elevates nitrate δ15N signals, potentially before oyster assimilation (via plankton). Nevertheless, oyster δ15N is a powerful tool for indicating nitrogen sources across spatial and temporal scales.

T1  - The ascidian Styela plicata as a potential bioremediator of bacterial and algal contamination of marine estuarine waters
AN  - 288561439
AB  - The tunicate Styela plicata (Ascidiacea) was investigated for its potential use in bioremediation of bacteria and microalgae blooms from estuarine waters. Salinity tolerances, filtration rate, substrate selection, and effects on digested bacteria and ichthyofaunal communities were examined. If acclimated slowly, Styela can be placed in salinities as low as 24 parts per thousand (ppt) before increased fatalities result. An immediate decrease in salinity from 32 ppt to 20 ppt was not detrimental at short term exposure (four days). One average-sized (∼40g)  Styela, exposed to 105 and 106 bacteria or microalgae mL−1, can filter as much as 4.7 L hr −1 and 3.3 L hr−1, respectively. Individual tunicate filtration rates varied from hour to hour, independent of organism size, indicating that filtration rates for this species would be better reported on a population basis rather than on an individual weight or size basis. Bacterial viability in tunicate feces was assessed by ATP analysis. Bacteria were found to be non-viable after passage through the tunicate digestive tract. Filtration of eggs or larvae of recreationally or commercially important fish is of concern. The smallest eggs (∼0.6 mm) reported in the Indian River Lagoon belong to Cynoscion nebulosus (spotted seatrout) and Bairdiella chrysoura (silver perch). Over the course of two hours, 72.5% of 0.5 mm glass beads (simulated fish eggs) were initially retained, but many were later expelled by the tunicates. For 1.0 mm beads, 49.4% were initially retained and for 2.0 mm beads, 43.5% were initially retained. Neither the size of the oral siphon nor the size of the overall animal was correlated to bead retention. Substrate selection was investigated using the tunicate  Phallusia nigra. Newly hatched larvae preferred settling on wood (53.7%), as compared to polyethylene (30.9%), high-density polyethylene (13.0%), and polyvinyl chloride (2.4%). Overall, results of this study indicate  S. plicata is very effective at removing bacteria and microalgae from estuarine waters. However, further testing is warranted regarding the unwanted removal of fish eggs and larvae before utilization of S. plicata for bioremedial purposes.

T1  - Biofouling
AN  - 2131297936
AB  - Biofouling (the colonisation of an interface by a diverse array of organisms) is almost always a problem where it occurs, as it negatively affects surfaces, the materials that they are made from and the  structures that they form, and   can even destroy them.
 
 This comprehensive book covers in detail in its first section the processes involved in marine , freshwater and medical biofouling including coverage of settlement by larvae and spores, biofouling community processes,   epibiosis (biofouling on living organisms) and microbial fouling, including biofilms deleterious to human health. The book's second section, encompassing biofouling processes with industrial implications, includes coverage of biofouling on artificial substrata, paints and coatings technology for the control of marine biofouling, biofouling and antifouling in the maritime industries, such as shipping, offshore oil , and aquaculture, and in power stations and other industries. The impacts of both biofouling and biofouling control and details of current legislation of relevance to biofouling issues are fully covered. The book's final section looks at methods for the measurement of biofouling, and future prospects for biofouling, including in-depth coverage of the changes anticipated in biofouling worldwide due to global climate change, and likely future directions in antifouling research, technology and legislation.
 
 

Biofouling, which includes contributions from many international experts, is an essential reference for all those working in the antifouling industry including those involved in formulation of antifouling products such as paints and other coatings. Aquatic biologists, ecologists, environmental scientists and lawyers, marine engineers, aquaculture personnel, chemists, and medical researchers will all find much of interest within this book. All universities and research establishments where these subjects are studied and taught should have copies of this important work on their shelves.Biofouling (the colonisation of an interface by a diverse array of organisms) is almost always a problem where it occurs, as it negatively affects surfaces, the materials that they are made from and the  structures that they form, and   can even destroy them.

The book's final section looks at methods for the measurement of biofouling, and future prospects for biofouling, including in-depth coverage of the changes anticipated in biofouling worldwide due to global climate change, and likely future directions in antifouling research, technology and legislation.
 
 

Biofouling, which includes contributions from many international experts, is an essential reference for all those working in the antifouling industry including those involved in formulation of antifouling products such as paints and other coatings. Aquatic biologists, ecologists, environmental scientists and lawyers, marine engineers, aquaculture personnel, chemists, and medical researchers will all find much of interest within this book. All universities and research establishments where these subjects are studied and taught should have copies of this important work on their shelves.

T1  - Province on alert for zebra mussels
AN  - 752235596
AB  - "They are a harmful, invasive species," Dwight Williamson, the assistant deputy minister of Water Stewardship and the province's expert on the tiny mollusk, said. "They are an excellent example of the need to take all water-management initiatives that will keep invasive species out of our water system."              Now, the province will erect similar signs along border crossings at North Dakota and Minnesota. Williamson said for the past 10 years, the province has employed inspectors during the summer season at border crossings who examine boats coming into Manitoba for the zebra mussels.              "Since the early 1990s, we've believed that it was inevitable that zebra mussels would find their way to Manitoba," Williamson said. "We thought that through these preventative measures, we could slow down or significantly delay their entry into the province.

T1  - Invasive Species Management:&nbsp;A Handbook of Principles and Techniques
AN  - 2135389685
AB  - Invasive alien species are a major and growing threat to biodiversity worldwide. The transport of organisms through increased levels of trade and tourism is leading to the widespread breaching of natural biogeographic barriers at unprecedented rates. Consequences can be severe, especially in naturally isolated ecosystems. Invasive alien species can cause the extinction of vulnerable endemic species, alter the structure and composition of communities, disruptsuccessional pathways, and lead to the loss of ecosystem services. Global climate change may further exacerbate the spread of alien species, as climatic zones shift and potential ranges alter.The effective management of invasive alien species is clearly a priority for biological conservation worldwide. This book first provides strategies for managing such species at successive invasion stages, from prevention at the border to control of major infestations. It then describes the general tools and approaches that are recommended for successful management of particular groups of invasive organisms in a range of environments. In each case, the ecological basis and practical requirementsof invasive alien species management are addressed.This integration of proven techniques and policies will be useful to a wide readership of students, academics, conservation practitioners, invasive species managers, legislators, and to the broader community concerned with biological conservation.

T1  - Alien invasion requires fight
AN  - 374565115
AB  - What's the common thread? It's all about invasive alien species. These are plants and animals that end up in an environment where they weren't previously found - usually with help from humans - typically causing harm to the native species and ecosystems they interact with. 

              
Globalization and human movement have increased the spread of invasive species worldwide. As with plants and animals introduced by European settlers and explorers, today's invasive plants and animals are sometimes deliberately introduced - often for food or decorative purposes - and are sometimes accidentally introduced, as with zebra mussels and invasive plants spread when ships empty their ballast in Canadian waters. 

              
Once an introduced species has established itself, it is extremely difficult to eradicate. Targeted control is commonly used where species have already been introduced. This can range from removing the alien species to using pesticides or herbicides to introducing native predator species.

T1  - Costs of Alien Invasive Species in Sweden
AN  - 207667545; 19580030
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present calculations of total costs of 13 alien invasive species (AIS) in Sweden. All species are subject to control by Swedish public authorities, and estimates for most AIS include either damage cost or actual control cost. The results indicate a total annual cost between approximately 1620 and 5080 million SEK, which correspond to SEK 175 and SEK 565 per capita in Sweden. The estimates are well within the range of similar calculations for other countries, but differ with respect to the composition of costs of different AIS. Whereas costs for the agricultural and forestry sectors dominate in most other studies, the costs of AIS in Sweden are more equally divided among different categories. The results also Indicate that the highest costs are attributable to unintentionally introduced AIS and that the most reliable cost estimates are related to human and animal health.

T1  - Ecosystem engineering and biodiversity in coastal sediments: posing hypotheses
AN  - 205297093
AB  - Coastal sediments in sheltered temperate locations are strongly modified by ecosystem engineering species such as marsh plants, seagrass, and algae as well as by epibenthic and endobenthic invertebrates. These ecosystem engineers are shaping the coastal sea and landscape, control particulate and dissolved material fluxes between the land and sea, and between the benthos and the passing water or air. Above all, habitat engineering exerts facilitating and inhibiting effects on biodiversity. Despite a strongly growing interest in the functional role of ecosystem engineering over the recent years, compared to food web analyses, the conceptual understanding of engineering-mediated species interactions is still in its infancy. In the present paper, we provide a concise overview on current insights and propose two hypotheses on the general mechanisms by which ecosystem engineering may affect biodiversity in coastal sediments. We hypothesise that autogenic and allogenic ecosystem engineers have inverse effects on epibenthic and endobenthic biodiversity in coastal sediments. The primarily autogenic structures of the epibenthos achieve high diversity at the expense of endobenthos, whilst allogenic sediment reworking by infauna may facilitate other infauna and inhibits epibenthos. On a larger scale, these antagonistic processes generate patchiness and habitat diversity. Due to such interaction, anthropogenic influences can strongly modify the engineering community by removing autogenic ecosystem engineers through coastal engineering or bottom trawling. Another source of anthropogenic influences comes from introducing invasive engineers, from which the impact is often hard to predict. We hypothesise that the local biodiversity effects of invasive ecosystem engineers will depend on the engineering strength of the invasive species, with engineering strength defined as the number of habitats it can invade and the extent of modification. At a larger scale of an entire shore, biodiversity need not be decreased by invasive engineers and may even increase. On a global scale, invasive engineers may cause shore biota to converge, especially visually due to the presence of epibenthic structures.

T1  - From beach to savanna: Vegetation transitions at Illinois Beach State Park
AN  - 305148420
AB  - As a starting point for this thesis, several key threads in the development of 20th Century Ecology and the phenomenological approaches of Goethe and Husserl were described. These considerations led to the search for morphological categories able to reflect large-scale ecological phenomena—such as found in the Intertropical Convergence Zone and Africa's rainforest/desert polarity—but also the effects of Plant Available Moisture (PAM) and Plant Available Light (PAL) on the vegetation found at a dune and ridge beach-plain located on the western shore of Lake Michigan at Illinois Beach State Park (IBSP). Using the relevé method, data were gathered from twelve 100-square-meter plots aligned from shore to savanna over a 200m long section of IBSP. With leaf aspect-ratio and petiole presence serving as dependent variables, PAM and PAL as independent variables, high correlations were found between increased leaf aspect-ratio, increases in PAM, and lower levels of PAL Similarly, the presence of petioles correlated strongly with increases in PAM and decreases in PAL. These results suggest that selected morphological characteristics of plants at IBSP resonate with larger patterns found at the scale of the biosphere and of continents such as Africa.   Keywords. Plant Available Moisture (PAM), Plant Available Light (PAL), leaf aspect-ratio, petiole presence, expansion, contraction, vertical extension, lateral extension, peripheral expansion, beach, ridge, swale.

T1  - Geographic variation in species demography and community structure in temperate rocky reefs
AN  - 305004493
AB  - Geographic variation in coastal marine upwelling creates a complex seascape of environmental conditions that underlie biogeographic patterns of demographic rates, species distributions, and the structure of marine assemblages. Quantitative descriptions of spatial and temporal variation in assemblages can identify potential processes that regulate structure and dynamics of species at different scales. Understanding the spatial patterns of species demography and structure of assemblages across the seascape also informs more applied endeavors such as fisheries management, conservation of species diversity and species response to global change. This dissertation addresses patterns of community structure and demographic variation of populations in temperate kelp forest ecosystems and explores mechanisms that may generate these patterns.    In Chapter 1, I present one of the first comprehensive studies of kelp forest community structure across variable upwelling conditions. Variation in the strength and frequency of upwelling can influence coastal marine assemblages through bottom-up effects of temperature, nutrients, and larval delivery. However, high variability in community structure may exist at local scales due to species interactions, habitat structure, and other local-scale processes. I ask whether benthic species vary across regional scales (10s-100s km), reflecting variation in upwelling, or at local-scales (1-10s km), signaling possible effects of local processes. From replicate detailed surveys of kelp forest flora and fauna, I explicitly test the assumption that subtidal benthic communities exhibit variation in the abundance of dominant benthic functional groups associated with regional-scale variation in upwelling. I demonstrate that upwelling processes regulate biomass of functional groups in kelp forest assemblages, but that local-scale patterns are important for some species, highlighting the need to look at both aggregate and compositional aspects of natural assemblages.    In Chapters 2 and 3, I compare life history traits (i.e. growth, fecundity, and survival) among populations of Megastraea undosa, a benthic turbinid snail, across different upwelling regimes. Geographic variation in life history traits underlies patterns of population persistence, biogeography, evolutionary biology, and predicted response to global change and resource management; but, geographic variation in life history traits has received little attention, particularly in marine conservation and management.    Variation in coastal upwelling dynamics leads to differences in both temperature and food availability, two factors that can affect energy available for individual maintenance, reproduction and growth. However, temperature and food availability are negatively correlated in coastal marine systems dominated by upwelling and may lead to reduced energy available for multiple life history traits. In Chapter 2, I examine whether geographic variation in upwelling leads to trade-offs between growth and reproduction in  Megastraea undosa, and whether geographic differences in trade-offs lead to differences in average individual fitness between populations. Using mark-recapture and histology techniques, I demonstrate that geographic variation in trade-offs between growth and reproduction exists and is related to variation in upwelling. In cold, nutrient-rich waters, higher growth rates lead to lower reproductive allocation, while in regions of less persistent upwelling, the opposite occurs. However, these two different life history strategies lead to similar lifetime cumulative reproductive output between regions. These results highlight the importance of considering multiple life history traits rather than single traits when examining geographic variation in population dynamics. Furthermore, I show that applying similar fisheries regulations across populations with varying demography may result in local depletion of populations.    In Chapter 3, I examine whether a relationship between seawater temperature and individual growth of M. undosa exists, and if this relationship varies with regional variation in upwelling conditions. I reconstruct time series of water temperature and growth of M. undosa using isotopes and growth marks in calcium carbonate opercula. Results indicate that M. undosa growth is correlated with water temperature, but the direction of the correlation depends on upwelling region. The mechanisms causing spatial variation in these relationships are likely the direct effects of temperature on metabolism coupled with the indirect responses of the dominant macroalgae to upwelling intensity and energy allocation to other vital rates.

T1  - Life cycle, reliability-based, river restoration
AN  - 304835919
AB  - Aquatic ecosystems worldwide are being severely altered or destroyed at a rate greater than they are being restored (NRC,  1992). According to the 1994 National Water Quality Inventory of 617,806 miles of rivers and streams, only 56 percent fully supported multiple uses, including drinking water supply, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, and agriculture, as well as flood protection and erosion control ( FISRWG, 2001). In 2005, the National River Restoration Science Synthesis (NRRSS) working group released the results of a multi-year study of the motivations and subsequent performance of completed river restoration projects within the United States. Through the development of a comprehensive database, the study found that although over $1 billion is spent on restoration projects each year, it was found that more than half the projects failed to meet the intended goals and design criteria (Kondolf and Downs, 2004).    River restoration is not a mature science (Brookes and Shields,  1996) and there exists significant gaps in scientific knowledge of river restoration, as well as undetermined biases and errors in the current empirical design formulations and numerical models, resulting in 'uncertainties' that dramatically impact the outcomes of these projects.    River restoration projects fail through the omission of essential parameters in the development and configuration of the project. In order to achieve reliable river restoration projects it is essential that the problem to be remedied is completely and comprehensively defined; that project-related uncertainties (i.e. physical, temporal, financial) be acknowledged, estimated, and accounted for; and interactive management approaches (such as adaptive management) be configured and employed to manage those parameters identified as having significant influence on the project and high magnitudes of uncertainty.   River restoration is evaluated from a life-cycle perspective. Additionally, reliability is a central theme of the research. By including reliability into river restoration, it becomes possible to directly incorporate project performance as well as the plethora of uncertainties that plague many river restoration efforts from achieving their intended outcomes.   Through literature reviews, this research synthesizes the current interdisciplinary river restoration body of knowledge (classified by NRRSS goal categories) and created a river restoration 'checklist' with associated resources (planning guides, design manuals, computer software programs, and GIS data) for planning and design to correlate minimum project requirements with intended restoration goals. Case studies are presented for validation and the case studies also present management strategies for restoration uncertainties and adaptive management.

T1  - Probiotic Bacteria for Hatchery Production of Greenshell Mussels, Perna Canaliculus
AN  - 3039732333
AB  - The Greenshell™ mussel (GSM), Perna canaliculus, industry in New Zealand (NZ) is the largest aquaculture sector in the country. In 2006, the export earnings were valued at US$145 million which represented 65% of NZ aquaculture earnings. Historically, and at present, GSM production involves the capture of wild mussels on ropes followed by ongrowing of these animals to market size (approximately 14 months). However, hatchery production of GSM has been developed in recent years. Hatchery production will alleviate the seasonal uncertainties of current techniques and allow the benefits of selective breeding programs. To date, efforts to produce commercial quantities of GSM in hatcheries have been hampered by unreliable larval rearing. These problems were often alleviated by antibiotic use, which implied bacterial pathogens as the cause. Yet, the ongoing use of antibiotics is not sustainable because of increasing legislative restrictions on their use and the possible emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Hence, the identification and use of novel probiotics was investigated as an alternative.Because of a lack of previous work, it was necessary to investigate the bacterial pathogenesis of GSM larvae in the initial stages and, hence, to determine the cause of disease against which the probiotics would be active. Twenty-two bacterial strains, isolated from compromised larvae, were screened for larval toxicity using a larval bioassay. Two strains were identified as potential pathogens. Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene identified Vibrio splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1, a Vibrio coralliilyticus/neptunius-like isolate, as pathogens of GSM larvae. These strains had the ability to cause 83 and 75% GSM larval mortality in vitro respectively, at a concentration 102  CFU ml-1. Histopathology indicated the route of infection was via the digestive system. Using healthy larvae as target hosts, Koch’s postulates were confirmed for the two isolates.Although two bacterial pathogens were identified, the successful design and implementation of protective measures in the hatchery still required an understanding of the dynamics of the infection process. Developing an in situ experimental model for infection was therefore paramount. The minimum effective pathogenic dose (MEPD) of V. splendidus (105  CFU ml-1) and Vibrio sp. DO1 (106  CFU ml-1) was demonstrated for GSM larvae during hatchery production. In a flow-through water hatchery system, larvae given 1-2 hours of static water exposure with these pathogen doses, after which flowthrough processes resumed, averaged 58% and 69% cumulative mortality, respectively, on the fourth day following pathogen exposure. Larvae exposed to a dosage one order of magnitude greater than the MEPD, had higher mortalities of 73% and 96% for V. splendidus and Vibrio sp. DO1 respectively. These four levels of mortality were significantly greater than those of the non-exposed control larvae, averaging 23% in the experiments involving V. splendidus and 35% with Vibriosp. DO1. Experiments were repeated four times to establish reproducibility. The infection models were reproducible and provided a tool to assess measures for the protection of GSM larvae against infection in the hatchery environment.

TT  - Impact of Urban Releases on the Immune and Endocrine System in the Elliptio Complanata Mussel
AN  - 2827701214
AB  - Le but de cette étude était de déterminer si les effluents urbains peuvent perturber l'immunité et la reproduction d'une espèce sentinelle, la moule d'eau douce Elliptio complanata. Trois échelles d'évaluations ont permis de tester cette hypothèse au niveau cellulaire et hormonal, dans des conditions de laboratoire et de terrain.Tout d'abord, une expérience en aquarium a consisté en l'exposition de moules à différentes concentrations d'effluents urbains de la ville de laval (Québec) issus de traitements physico-chimique (effluent F) ou par biofiltration (effluent A), et caractérisés chimiquement de façon exhaustive. les réponses obtenues, apparues généralement à partir d'une concentration de 10%, ont confirmé la sensibilité des biomarqueurs immunologiques chez les bivalves. les animaux ont subit une diminution de leurs comptes d'hémocytes, accompagnée d'une augmentation de la phagocytose et une diminution de la capacité cytotoxique des cellules immunitaires. la sécrétion d'oxyde nitrique fut augmentée de façon proportionnelle à la phagocytose, suggérant que cette molécule joue un rôle important dans la lutte antibactérienne chez les bivalves d'eau douce. Aucune perturbation des mécanismes endocriniens,mesurés par la sécrétion de vitellogénine (VTG) dans la gonade, n'a été mesurée.Dans une deuxième expérience, les moules ont été exposées aux mêmes effluents F et A dans le cours d'eau récepteur, la rivière des Mille-Îles, grâce à la mise en place de cages d'exposition en aval et en amont des rejets par les stations d'épuration. les résultats ont montrés que les effluents urbains peuvent provoquer la mort des mollusques (60% en aval des deux rejets) après un mois d'exposition. Cependant, les effets immunologiques ont été très différents selon la station. l'effluent F, rejeté en amont de la rivière, a provoqué une immunostimulation induite par les fortes charges bactériennes. l'effluent A a cependant inhibé les fonctions cellulaires et la sécrétion de lysozymes, indiquant probablement une contamination chimique plus toxique ainsi qu'une accumulation des polluants le long de la rivière. De plus, des liens entre activité phagocytaire et production de VTG chez les moules ont été mis en évidence de manière statistique, suggérant une implication de cette protéine dans les processus immunitaires, et donc des liens entre l'immunité et le statut hormonal.Afin de tester ces hypothèses au niveau cellulaire, des hémocytes ont été exposés in vitro à la VTG isolée de gonade de moule ainsi qu'à l'estradiol. Les résultats montrent que la que la VTG peut stimuler faiblement la phagocytose. De même, l'estradiol peut augmenter cette activité immunitaire, ce qui suggère la présence de récepteurs aux stéroïdes sexuels sur les hémocytes.Ces expériences ont donc contribué à une meilleure connaissance des mécanismes de toxicité des rejets urbains sur les moules d'eau douce, qui sont des espèces largement utilisées en écotoxicologie et qui jouent un rôle majeur dans le fonctionnement des écosystèmes lacustres. Les mécanismes cellulaires de ces perturbations devront être précisés, ainsi que le rôle des différents contaminants contenus dans ces effluents.Alternate abstract:The aim of this study was to determine whether urban effluents can disrupt the immunity and reproduction of a sentinel species, the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Three rating scales were used to test this hypothesis at the cellular and hormonal level, under laboratory and field conditions.First, an aquarium experiment consisted of exposing mussels to different concentrations of urban effluents from the city of Laval (Quebec) resulting from physico-chemical treatments (effluent F) or by biofiltration (effluent A), and exhaustively chemically characterized. the responses obtained, generally appearing from a concentration of 10%, confirmed the sensitivity of immunological biomarkers in bivalves. the animals experienced a decrease in their hemocyte counts, accompanied by an increase in phagocytosis and a decrease in the cytotoxic capacity of immune cells. nitric oxide secretion was increased proportionally to phagocytosis, suggesting that this molecule plays an important role in antibacterial control in freshwater bivalves. No disruption of endocrine mechanisms, measured by vitellogenin (VTG) secretion in the gonad, was measured.In a second experiment, the mussels were exposed to the same F and A effluents in the receiving watercourse, the Rivière des Mille-Îles, thanks to the installation of exposure cages downstream and upstream of the discharges by treatment plants. the results showed that urban effluents can cause the death of molluscs (60% downstream of the two discharges) after one month of exposure. However, the immunological effects were very different depending on the station. effluent F, discharged upstream of the river, caused immunostimulation induced by high bacterial loads. Effluent A, however, inhibited cellular functions and lysozyme secretion, probably indicating more toxic chemical contamination as well as an accumulation of pollutants along the river. In addition, links between phagocytic activity and VTG production in mussels have been statistically demonstrated, suggesting an involvement of this protein in immune processes, and therefore links between immunity and hormonal status.In order to test these hypotheses at the cellular level, hemocytes were exposed in vitro to VTG isolated from mussel gonad as well as to estradiol. The results show that VTG can weakly stimulate phagocytosis. Similarly, estradiol may increase this immune activity, suggesting the presence of sex steroid receptors on haemocytes.These experiments have therefore contributed to a better understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity of urban discharges on freshwater mussels, which are species widely used in ecotoxicology and which play a major role in the functioning of lake ecosystems. The cellular mechanisms of these disturbances will have to be specified, as well as the role of the various contaminants contained in these effluents.

T1  - Moving Beyond Strawmen and Artificial Dichotomies: Adaptive Management When an Endangered Species Uses an Invasive One
AN  - 196569388
AB  - Evans et al. (Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics, 2008) have attempted to enmesh me in their dispute with the Florida Bureau of Invasive Plant Management about a specific system, Kings Bay/Crystal River. In so doing, they repeatedly mischaracterize my positions in order to depict, incorrectly, invasion biology as monolithic and me as a representative of one extreme of a false dichotomy about management of introduced species. In addition, they introduce an issue irrelevant in this case (extinctions) and cite incorrect data. Proposing to manage people, manatees, introduced plants, and cyanobacteria in Kings Bay by participative adaptive management, they ignore the fact that living organisms can both disperse autonomously and hitchhike. Finally, they present few details on any aspect of their management proposal and do not address the myriad problems that have beset previous attempts at scientific adaptive management, especially at large scales. Until such a management approach is fleshed out and implemented, it is impossible to assess its validity for Kings Bay, and it is very premature to suggest it as a general model for dealing with invasive species disputes.

Piet Nienhuis (Groningen, 29 October 1938) passed through an international career of 40 years as researcher (biologist, ecologist) and research leader at the Netherlands Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences, and as professor and director at the Radboud University Nijmegen (the Netherlands) and the Free University Brussels (Belgium). He was chairman and advisor of services of the European Commission and several Dutch governmental departments. He published hundreds of scientific publications, mainly devoted to ecology and environmental sciences, in particular to estuarine and river ecology and management. After his retirement in 2003 he continued his writing activities, together with his editorial and advisory work.

T1  - Social networks of lake management in Becker and Otter Tail counties, MN: A case study
AN  - 304543380
AB  - Management of lakes requires an understanding of both ecological and social concepts. As lakeshores continue to be developed, human lake communities need to be aware of the ecological relationships as well as the interested stakeholders that may play a role as management decisions are made. The focus of this study was to describe the role of communication as a social network of lake management stakeholders in Minnesota using a case study method. The objectives were to describe and characterize stakeholders associated with management of three lakes in west-central Minnesota and to assess the relative activities and roles of government and non-government organizations. Ties among stakeholders were demonstrated using social network analysis. Density, measures of centrality, and frequency were estimated to identify central actors. Density was higher for information exchange than for funding or materials exchange. Central actors identified across exchange networks generally included county organizations, state organizations, federal agencies, watershed districts, soil and water conservation districts, and coalitions of lake associations. Lake associations and lake improvement districts were not as centrally located as some of the other stakeholders. The incorporation of methods from several disciplines may assist lake communities and land managers with lake management decisions. Throughout the decades, increasing pressures on these scarce resources has led to an increase in the number of rules and regulations placed on lakeshore owners. As agencies with differing objectives and missions continue to implement regulations due to changing needs and as special interest groups lobby for or against standards, lake communities need to be able to recognize the role they have in the management decision-making process. By recognizing the roles and positions of organizations within the network, conflict, collaboration, and changes in management needs, a better decision-making process can be achieved in lake management.

T1  - Macroinvertebrate composition and patterns of prey use by juvenile pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) in the Missouri River, South Dakota and Nebraska
AN  - 304460398
AB  - Macroinvertebrates were collected from the Missouri River downstream of Fort Randall and Gavins Point dams to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns in abundance and describe habitats important for macroinvertebrates. The most abundant families collected were Chironomidae, Ceratopogonidae, Isonychiidae, Baetidae, Caenidae, Heptageniidae, Hydropsychidae, and Polycentropodidae. Invertebrate abundance, richness, diversity, and evenness were generally higher in the Gavins Point reach than in the Fort Randall reach for most gear types (except Surber samples). In the Fort Randall reach, mean richness, diversity, and evenness were generally highest in the delta formed downstream of the Niobrara River.    We collected 31 juvenile pallid sturgeon during summer 2006 for diet analysis, of which 21 had prey in their stomachs. Percent occurrence of predominant prey was Ceratopogonidae (81%), Isonychiidae (67%), Chironomidae (52%), and fish (24%). Diets as percent composition by wet weight were fish (68%), Ephemeroptera (23%), Decapoda (6%), and Diptera (3%). As juvenile pallid sturgeon length increased (356–720 mm fork length), the proportion of fish in the diets increased (43 to 88%). This study showed the importance of macroinvertebrates as a food source for juvenile pallid sturgeon (<600 mm fork length).

T1  - Site use and migration of scoters (Melanitta spp.) in relation to the spawning of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi )
AN  - 304354693
AB  - I investigated movements and site use by two scoter species during late winter and spring. In the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, I found that radio-transmitter-tagged pre-migratory surf scoters ( Melanitta perspicillata) and white-winged scoters (Melanitta fusca) left the areas where they had spent the winter and moved to Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) spawn sites coincident with spawn availability in March. In southeast Alaska, I identified stopover and staging sites of satellite-transmitter-tagged migrating surf scoters and identified one site, Lynn Canal, as particularly important. I found that herring spawn availability and proximity to the mainland coast were strong predictors of site use, suggesting that the resource availability and geography of southeast Alaska provide important stopover habitat for migrants. Overall, there was strong phenological correspondence between the northward progression of scoter migration and herring spawn availability, suggesting that herring spawn is a valuable resource for scoters in late winter and spring.    Keywords. habitat use; herring spawn; migration; radio telemetry; satellite telemetry; surf scoter; white-winged scoter.    Subject terms.

T1  - L'importance Relative de L'eau et de la Nourriture Comme Vecteurs D'accumulation du Cadmium Chez le Bivalve D'eau Douce Pyganodon Grandis
AN  - 2827702811
AB  - La dégradation des écosystèmes aquatiques marins et d’eaux douces par les contaminants, tels que les métaux, est étudiée depuis plusieurs décennies. Dans ce domaine, l’utilisation de mollusques comme biomoniteurs se fait de plus en plus commune. En effet, les mollusques sont utilisés pour évaluer l’étendue et l’impact de la pollution métallique dans une région. Leur durée de vie relativement longue, leur tolérance à des concentrations internes élevées de métaux et leur taux de dépuration lent permettent l’utilisation de mollusques comme biomoniteurs à long terme. Cependant, la très grande majorité des études consacrées à l’accumulation des métaux chez les mollusques se sont portées sur des espèces marines. Quelques efforts récents ont été faits ces dernières années pour ajouter des espèces d’eau douce à la liste de biomoniteurs; un candidat potentiel serait le bivalve Pyganodon grandis.De nombreuses études récentes, qui ont suivi les changements spatiaux et temporaux des concentrations en Cd chez ce bivalve, ont démontré qu’il y a une bonne relation entre les concentrations en Cd chez P. grandis et les concentrations de Cd dans son environnement. Cependant, ces études n’ont pu déterminer par quel(s) vecteur(s), l’eau ou la nourriture, provenait le Cd. Avant que P. grandis ne puisse être pleinement exploité comme biomoniteur, il serait important de savoir si ce mollusque accumule les métaux par ingestion ou via l’eau ambiante (ou par les deux vecteurs).L’objectif global de cette étude était donc de déterminer l’importance relative de l’eau et de la nourriture comme vecteurs d’accumulation de Cd chez le bivalve d’eau douce Pyganodon grandis. Afin d’évaluer l’importance relative de chaque vecteur comme source de Cd, le bivalve devait être exposé à une source de Cd à la fois, c'est-à-dire des expositions séparées au Cd aqueux et alimentaire. Les résultats de ces expériences ont été intégrés dans un modèle de bioaccumulation qui a permis de prédire l’importance de chaque vecteur pour divers scénarios d’exposition.Des spécimens adultes de P. grandis ont été recueillis dans un lac peu contaminé de la région de Rouyn-Noranda et transportés au laboratoire à Québec afin d’établir une culture mère. Dans une première série d’expériences, les bivalves ont été exposés à une gamme de concentrations de Cd dissous (0,1; 0,5; 5 et 20 nM) pour une période de 96 h. Afin de faciliter l’alimentation des animaux, les bivalves ont été enlevés de l’aquarium d’exposition et mis dans une chambre expérimentale, remplie d’eau non contaminée, et nourris avec des algues non contaminées. Les taux de filtration des bivalves ont été mesurés durant ces périodes d’alimentation. Dans des expériences subséquentes, les bivalves ont été nourris d’algues vertes (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) contaminées en Cd pendant 4 périodes d’alimentation de 4 h. Après la dernière exposition, les bivalves ont subi une période de dépuration de 8 j. Les taux de filtration des bivalves ont été mesurés durant l’expérience d’alimentation afin de calculer les taux d’ingestion des bivalves et l’efficacité d’assimilation du Cd ingéré. Dans une dernière expérience, la répartition subcellulaire du Cd a été déterminée chez des bivalves exposés au Cd aqueux ou alimentaire dans le but d’observer si l’accumulation du Cd dans les fractions subcellulaires changeait selon la provenance du métal.Alternate abstract:Contamination of marine and freshwater environments by metals has become a global problem. Several attempts have been made in recent years to use aquatic species as sentinel organisms, as they can reveal spatial and temporal variations in bioavailable metal concentrations and overall water quality. The use of bivalves as sentinels has become common practice as their relative long life-spans, their tolerance of high internal metal concentrations and their slow depuration rates allow them to be used as long-term biomonitors. However, the vast majority of past research on metal accumulation in molluscs has been focused on marine species. There has been some interest in recent years for adding freshwater bivalves to the list of sentinel organisms; one potential candidate is the freshwater bivalve, Pyganodon grandis.Recent spatial and temporal studies have shown a strong relationship between Cd concentrations in P. grandis and Cd concentrations in its environment. However, these studies were unable to determine whether P. grandis accumulated Cd from the dissolved or particulate phase (or both). If this bivalve is to be used as a Cd biomonitor, it is important to complement the field studies with laboratory studies that determine the filtration, ingestion and efflux rates, as well as Cd assimilation efficiencies from water and food, for this organism. The results from these laboratory studies could then be used in a bioaccumulation model to estimate the relative importance of waterborne and dietborne Cd as sources of Cd for this bivalve.The main objective of the present study was thus to determine the relative importance of water and food as sources of cadmium for the freshwater bivalve, Pyganodon grandis. In order to better evaluate cadmium uptake from either food or water, the animals were exposed to one source at a time, meaning separate aqueous and dietary exposures. The results of these experiments were then used in a bioaccumulation model to predict the relative importance of each pathway as a source of Cd for P. grandis.Adult specimens of P. grandis were collected from a lake having low trace-metal concentrations in the mining region of Rouyn-Noranda, and were transported to Quebec City to establish a stock culture in the laboratory. In a first series of experiments, bivalves were exposed to several different concentrations of dissolved Cd (0.1, 0.5, 5.0 and 20 nM) during short-term experiments (96 h). During these experiments, the bivalves were removed from their exposure aquaria and allowed to feed on noncontaminated food in a Cd-free medium for 4 h, during which time bivalve filtration rates were measured; these filtration rates were then used to calculate Cd absorption efficiencies from the inhaled water. In second series of experiments, bivalves were fed Cd-contaminated algae (Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) during 4 x 4-h feeding periods and allowed to depurate for 8 days follow the exposure to dietary Cd. Bivalve filtration rates were measured during the feeding experiments in order to calculate the bivalve ingestion rates and the assimilation efficiency of ingested Cd. In a third series of experiments, the subcellular partitioning of Cd was determined in bivalves exposed to either aqueous or dietary Cd. The goal was to see whether the subcellular partitioning of Cd in the gills and digestive gland of bivalves differed based on route of uptake.

T1  - Economics of alien invasive species management — choices of targets and policies
AN  - 2676583734
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present the economic analysis and research on invasive species management, which implies, in principle, a focus on two main questions: (i) how to set targets for species damage mitigation? and (ii) which policy instruments are best in achieving the target(s)? The results indicated that a majority of the studies recognize the need for addressing the links between economic and ecological systems and accounting for the uncertainty associated with predicting damages from invasive species. A common result is that strategies for prevention, control and damage reduction are complementary, and neglect of any of them may lead to unnecessary large social costs. Furthermore, unless economy-wide adjustments are accounted for when designing tariffs on imports, counteractive results may occur where the risk of invasive species damage increases. However, due to insufficient availability of data on the environmental impacts of alien invasive species, there is a lack of empirical applications.

T1  - Framing and Reframing in Invasion Biology
AN  - 217781970
AB  - In this essay, we focus on metaphors in invasion biology. The emergence of this discipline went hand in hand with heated debates on the so-called exotic species issue. The dualistic stalemate in which these debates have resulted-with only two extreme positions, nativism on the one hand and cosmopolitanism on the other-is at least partly connected to the dominance of loaded political metaphors. To break up this dichotomy to create space for fruitful debate, we will explore various metaphorical frames of ecological thinking and their implications for invasion biology. We will deconstruct the nativism-cosmopolitanism dichotomy by identifying various management practices, in each of which the native species issue is shaped differently. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An Evaluation Pattern for Antimacrofouling Procedures: Limnoperna fortunei Larvae Study in a Hydroelectric Power Plant in South America
AN  - 207669919; 18074895
AB  - The effects of global change and globalization of trade on the biosphere spur an increase in bioinvasions and their subsequent impact on ecosystems. Continental invading bivalves are important because of their impact on artificially-constructed structures. Limnoperna fortunei was first found in the Neotropical region in 1991. Since then it has dispersed upstream in the Plata and Guaíba basins at a rate of 240 km y^sup -1^. This species causes macrofouling in a manner similar to that caused by Dreissena polymorpha. This paper describes the biology of L. fortunei larvae from a hydroelectric power plant in South America. We suggest the importance of knowing the biology of the invading species and the need to consider the settlement patterns and densities of larvae in each of the sectors of the facility in order to achieve a sustainable prevention/control of macrofouling. This study acquires a global significance under the assumption that L. fortunei will eventually invade North America and Europe. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Fast Economic Development Accelerates Biological Invasions in China
AN  - 1950341942
AB  - Increasing levels of global trade and intercontinental travel have been cited as the major causes of biological invasion. However, indirect factors such as economic development that affect the intensity of invasion have not been quantitatively explored. Herein, using principal factor analysis, we investigated the relationship between biological invasion and economic development together with climatic information for China from the 1970s to present. We demonstrate that the increase in biological invasion is coincident with the rapid economic development that has occurred in China over the past three decades. The results indicate that the geographic prevalence of invasive species varies substantially on the provincial scale, but can be surprisingly well predicted using the combination of economic development (R2 = 0.378) and climatic factors (R2 = 0.347). Economic factors are proven to be at least equal to if not more determinant of the occurrence of invasive species than climatic factors. International travel and trade are shown to have played a less significant role in accounting for the intensity of biological invasion in China. Our results demonstrate that more attention should be paid to economic factors to improve the understanding, prediction and management of biological invasions.

T1  - Ecosystem Engineers:&nbsp;Plants to Protists
AN  - 2131007088
AB  - The first book entirely devoted to this topic, Ecosystem Engineers begins with the history of the concept, presenting opposing definitions of ecosystem engineeing. These varied definitions advance the debate and move past trivial difficulties to crystallize key issues such as the value of process-based vs. outcome-based. Authors include case studies spanning a wide spectrum of species and habitats, including above and below-ground, aquatic and terrestrial, and extant and paleontological examples. These studies enable readers to understand how the categorization of species as ecosystem engineers allows scientists to forge new explanatory generalizations. Key for all ecologists and environmentalists, this book ultimately illustrates how to inform and manage natural resources.  The only consolidated treatment available Provides definitions, case studies, and examples of ecological models Discusses how ecosystem engineering can inform and improve the management of natural resources Includes contributions from Clive Jones, the leading figure in the development of the ecosystem engineer concept, and many other eminent ecologists, such as Alan Hastings

T1  - Limnoecology: The Ecology of Lakes and Streams. Oxford Biology.
AN  - 2135390455
AB  - This concise, readable introduction to limnology (the science of investigating the structure and function of inland waters), places the subject in the context of modern ecology. Unlike most ecological textbooks, which use examples taken almost exclusively from terrestrial systems, this book integrates the fields of limnology and ecology by presenting empirical data drawn entirely from freshwater ecosystems in order to advance ecological theories (limnoecology). This second edition builds upon the strengths of the first with the structure of the book following the same hierarchical concept of ecology, from habitat properties, individuals, populations, coupled populations and communities to ecosystems. However, it has been thoroughly revised throughout to incorporate findings from new technologies and methods (notably the rapid development of molecular genetic methods and stable isotope techniques) that have allowed a rapid and ongoing development of the field. There is a new emphasis on food webs, species diversity and ecosystem functioning, climate change, and conservation management. Key ecological questions are examined in the light of the latest experimental evidence.; Throughout the text evolutionary theory is applied to an understanding of freshwater ecosystems, thereby filling a niche between traditional limnology and evolutionary ecology.

AB  - The main themes of the Symposium were biodiversity in enclosed and semi-enclosed seas and artificial habitats, and the restoration of degraded systems. These themes are highly relevant today both from a basic scientific point of view and from an applied approach. The papers dealing with the first theme represent current research and concerns about marine biodiversity in enclosed seas and will have wide appeal to all those interested in understanding and preserving the biodiversity of the seas and in particular of the Mediterranean and Black Seas. The papers in the second theme represent a synthesis of up-to-date knowledge on artificial habitats and how they can contribute to protection of coastal marine ecosystems, to enhancement of species diversity and biological resources and to restoration of degraded marine environments.Up-to-date knowledge on Artificial Marine Habitats Presents current research about Marine Biodiversity in enclosed seas

T1  - Removal by Sorption and In Situ Biodegradation of Oil Spills Limits Damage to Marine Biota: A Laboratory Simulation
AN  - 207668589; 17520931
AB  - This study examined the efficiency of cotton grass fibers in removing diesel oil from the surface of water in conditions prevailing in the Baltic Sea. The effect of low temperature, salinity, and bacterial amendments were tested in laboratory-scale set-ups, whereas 600-L mesocosms filled with Baltic Sea water were used for testing the effects of diesel oil and rapid removal of the oil on microorganisms, phytoplankton, and mussels. Cotton grass proved to be an excellent sorbent for diesel oil from the water surface at a low temperature. Inoculation with diesel-enriched microorganisms enhanced degradation of oil significantly in laboratory-scale experiments. In mesocosm experiments, the addition of diesel oil (0.66 mg L^sup -1^, 0.533 L m^sup -1^) to the basins resulted in higher microbial density than in all other basins, including inoculated ones, suggesting that the Baltic Sea contains indigenous hydrocarbon degraders. The removal of oil with cotton grass significantly improved the survival of mussels in the mesocosm tests: 100% mortality in diesel basins versus 0% mortality in basins with cotton grass, respectively. However, the surviving mussels suffered from histopathological changes such as inflammatory responses, degenerations, and cell death. The observed rescuing effect was observable even when the cotton grass-bound oil was left in the water. The results underline the importance of rapid action in limiting damage caused by oil spills.

T1  - Seasonal variations in population dynamics and biomass of two Unio pictorum mancus (Mollusca, Unionidae) populations from two lakes of different trophic state
AN  - 2417765773
AB  - Samples of Unio pictorum mancus collected monthly from spring 2003 to summer 2004 in the meso-oligotrophic Lake Maggiore and the eutrophic Lake Candia were compared to evaluate the influence of lake trophic conditions on mussel populations. Shell form, maximum age (8 years) and percentage of organic matter in the shell and soft tissues were similar in both lakes. However, comparisons between same size classes revealed that mussels from Lake Maggiore were generally older, their shells heavier and their soft tissues lighter than those from Lake Candia. Recruitment occurred in both populations in June-July. The frequency distributions of adult mussels (>30 mm) and their soft tissues and shell biomasses in all size classes (range = 2 mm) were normal, but the curves of the mussels from Lake Candia were flat in comparison to those of mussels from Lake Maggiore. The median body size of Lake Maggiore mussels was 58 mm, while that of the Lake Candia population was 72 mm. During the study period the population density of each lake was fairly constant, whereas the population structure, and consequently the biomass, showed seasonal variations. The greatest differences were found between population density and shell and tissue biomass of the two populations, which were respectively 46.86 ind. m-2; 408 g d.w. m-2 and 38.67 g d.w. m-2 in Lake Maggiore, and 6.93 ind. m-2; 92.29 g d.w. m-2 and 14.04 g d.w. m-2 in Lake Candia. These values testify to the phenotypical plasticity of Unio pictorum mancus in relation to environmental characteristics, without excluding a possible genetic influence as a result of geographical isolation and the respective selection mechanisms. The influence exerted by the lake trophic level and by the physical environment on some population characteristics is discussed.

T1  - Anthropogenic and landscape factors control stream nitrogen transformations at multiple spatial scales
AN  - 304832983
AB  - Anthropogenic alterations to the global nitrogen (N) cycle have doubled reactive N flux into the biosphere and altered aquatic ecosystem function. Streams modify N loads carried to coastal ecosystems by converting N to organic forms or removing it as gaseous N. Understanding how streams transform N can offer insight to ecologists and land managers about how stream ecosystems function under elevated N loads. I researched how anthropogenic and landscape factors affect N transformations by studying streams in two distinct biomes and at multiple spatial scales.   At the landscape scale, I studied N concentrations in streams draining the Teton Range (Wyoming, USA), a sub-alpine and alpine ecosystem with variable lithology. Streams draining crystalline geology had higher N compared to streams draining carbonate geology, which had more vegetation, suggesting that lithology mediated patterns in vegetation and terrestrial N retention. At the reach scale, I studied how land use influenced N uptake and transformation in Midwestern streams (Michigan, USA) and found that dissimilatory N transformation rates (i.e., nitrification and denitrification) within streams were not affected by riparian zones, which are commonly used to mitigate water quality degradation. Dissimilatory N transformation rates were always < 10% of whole-stream N uptake and nitrification rates balanced denitrification rates, implying that denitrification did not represent net N loss from the water column. At the substratum scale, sediment organic carbon content correlated with denitrification, but only when nitrate concentration exceeded a threshold. Finally, I returned to the Tetons and found that grazing activity by invasive snails can increase periphyton N fixation rates in a stream with low N concentrations.   A synthesis of my findings from high N streams in the Midwest suggests that land-use practices have increased temporary N removal at the expense of permanent N removal. In the low N streams of the Tetons, observations from different spatial scales suggest that landscape factors that lower stream N concentrations and high rates of grazing together can influence the importance of N fixation in streams. My dissertation highlights multiple constraints on N processing in streams and emphasizes that basic ecological research can yield important results for management agencies.

T1  - Development of a food web model to develop sediment target levels for selected Persistent Organic Pollutants in Burrard Inlet
AN  - 304723634
AB  - This study reports the development and testing of a computer simulation model of the fate of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in Burrard Inlet. POPs are introduced into Burrard Inlet by a number of sources including both,  point sources (e.g., industrial and municipal effluent discharges) and non-point sources such as storm water runoff. Once introduced to the inlet, contaminants are subject to physical, chemical and biological processes that lead to dispersion and accumulation in different matrices of the marine environment.    The main purpose of the model is to provide a comprehensive ecosystem-level assessment of the fate of contaminants in Burrard Inlet to characterize the relationship between concentrations of POPs in sediments and organisms of the Burrard Inlet food-web. The results provided significant evidence of bioaccumulation of a PCB mixture in some key biological receptors in the food web and also include recommendations for the development of sediment target levels and loading for PCBs in support management decisions regarding POPs in Burrard Inlet.    Keywords: Food web model, Biomagnification, PCBs, Burrard Inlet.

T1  - Validation des outils immunotoxicologiques pour l'étude des effets biologiques des contaminants chimiques en milieu marin
TT  - Validation of Immunotoxicological Tools for the Study of the Biological Effects of Chemical Contaminants in the Marine Environment
AN  - 2827703231
AB  - Les activités industrielles, agricoles ou urbaines de l'homme exercent une pression chimique sur l'environnement marin. Lors d'accidents, mais le plus souvent lors de contaminations chroniques des effluents anthropiques, cette pression peut engendrer des effets toxiques de l'échelle moléculaire à l'échelle écosystémique perturbant le fonctionnement de l'écosystème marin côtier. Le risque environnemental de ces substances chimiques est caractérisé à l'aide de biomarqueurs. Ces outils permettent la détection de ces polluants ou de leurs effets toxiques, la prédiction de ces effets sur les écosystèmes et la surveillance de leur évolution. Depuis une vingtaine d'années les biomarqueurs du système immunitaire sont utilisés pour diagnostiquer des effets immunotoxiques de nombreux groupes de polluants, sur plusieurs espèces sentinelles des écosystèmes terrestres et aquatiques, notamment chez les bivalves. Néanmoins, plusieurs facteurs endogènes et environnementaux peuvent moduler le fonctionnement du système immunitaire d'un individu et ainsi confondre le signal immunotoxique du polluant. Dans le cadre d'une collaboration franco-canadienne entre deux réseaux de recherche en écotoxicologie, le Réseau de recherche en écotoxicologie du Saint Laurent (RRESL) et le groupement de recherche « interactions moléculaires et physiologiques des contaminants du milieu marin (GDR IMOPHYS), ce travail de doctorat s'est attaché à étudier l'impact de certains facteurs confondants, en vue de valider l'utilisation de l'outil immunotoxicologique dans l'évaluation du risque environnemental en milieu marin.La stratégie de l'étude s'est orientée selon trois axes, en utilisant deux espèces modèles communes dans l'évaluation environnementale de 1'écosystème marin, de par leurs caractéristiques écologiques et leur importance économique, l'huître creuse, Crassostrea gigas, et la moule bleue, Mytilus edulis. Un premier axe méthodologique s'est attaché à comparer différentes techniques et méthodes d'analyses des paramètres des cellules de la défense immunitaire chez les bivalves, les hémocytes, à développer un nouveau protocole d'exposition individuelle et à mettre au point un indice global de la réponse immunotoxique. Un second axe, écophysiologique, a cherché à étudier l'impact des facteurs endogènes et saisonniers sur le fonctionnement individuel du système immunitaire chez ces deux espèces de bivalves. Un dernier axe, a enfm étudié l'impact de ces facteurs confondants sur le signal immunotoxique émis par des xénobiotiques caractérisant des activités anthropiques, en condition d'exposition individuelle.L'axe méthodologique a montré l'importance critique du site anatomique de prélèvement des hémocytes pour des études immunotoxicologiques. À la suite d'ateliers internationaux d'harmonisation de méthodes d'analyses des paramètres immunitaires, un ensemble de protocoles, à standardiser, a été proposé dans le cadre de suivi de sites ateliers d'un réseau de recherche transatlantique en écotoxicologie (Réseau de Recherche sur les bivalves). Un indice cumulé immunotoxicologique a été développé, offrant une vision globale de la réponse immunotoxique. Enfin, cet axe a permis la mise au point un nouveau protocole opérationnel d'exposition individuelle, adapté à l'évaluation du risque chimique en milieu marin, autorisant une standardisation des conditions d'exposition, l'ajout de la mesure d'un trait de vie adapté à des expositions aigues ou chroniques et l'augmentation de la sécurité chimique pour l'utilisateur.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerHuman industrial, agricultural or urban activities exert chemical pressure on the marine environment. During accidents, but most often during chronic contamination of anthropogenic effluents, this pressure can generate toxic effects from the molecular scale to the ecosystem scale, disrupting the functioning of the coastal marine ecosystem. The environmental risk of these chemical substances is characterized using biomarkers. These tools allow the detection of these pollutants or their toxic effects, the prediction of these effects on ecosystems and the monitoring of their evolution. For the past twenty years, biomarkers of the immune system have been used to diagnose the immunotoxic effects of numerous groups of pollutants, on several sentinel species of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, in particular bivalves. Nevertheless, several endogenous and environmental factors can modulate the functioning of an individual's immune system and thus confuse the immunotoxic signal of the pollutant. As part of a Franco-Canadian collaboration between two research networks in ecotoxicology, the Saint Lawrence Ecotoxicology Research Network (RRESL) and the research group "molecular and physiological interactions of contaminants in the marine environment (GDR IMOPHYS), this doctoral work focused on studying the impact of certain confounding factors, with a view to validating the use of the immunotoxicological tool in the assessment of environmental risk in the marine environment.The strategy of the study was oriented along three axes, using two common model species in the environmental assessment of the marine ecosystem, due to their ecological characteristics and their economic importance, the cupped oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. A first methodological axis focused on comparing different techniques and methods for analyzing the parameters of immune defense cells in bivalves, hemocytes, developing a new individual exposure protocol and developing an overall index of the immunotoxic response. A second axis, ecophysiological, sought to study the impact of endogenous and seasonal factors on the individual functioning of the immune system in these two species of bivalves. Finally, a last axis studied the impact of these confounding factors on the immunotoxic signal emitted by xenobiotics characterizing anthropic activities, under individual exposure conditions.The methodological axis showed the critical importance of the anatomical site of hemocyte collection for immunotoxicological studies. Following international workshops for the harmonization of methods for analyzing immune parameters, a set of protocols, to be standardized, was proposed as part of the monitoring of workshop sites of a transatlantic research network in ecotoxicology (Réseau de Bivalve Research). A cumulative immunotoxicological index has been developed, offering an overall view of the immunotoxic response. Finally, this axis has enabled the development of a new operational protocol for individual exposure, adapted to the assessment of chemical risk in the marine environment, authorizing standardization of exposure conditions, the addition of the measurement of a of life suitable for acute or chronic exposures and increased chemical safety for the user.

T1  - Long-term changes of the Lake Michigan fish community following the reduction of exotic alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus)
AN  - 219325545
AB  - From an ecological perspective, alewife consumption of native fish larvae and competition with native young-of-year fishes for limited zooplankton are believed to have resulted in the decline of several native fish species, including the deepwater sculpin (Myoxocephalus thompsonii; Madenjian et al. 2005a), emerald shiner (Notmpis atherinioides; Crowder 1980), cisco (also known as lake herring, Coregonus artedii; Smith 1970; Wells and McLain 1973), and yellow perch (Perca flavescem; Wells 1977; Jude and Tesar 1985; Eck and Wells 1987), and have limited the restoration of lake trout (Krueger et al. 1995).  Partially owing to the economic and ecological hardship wrought by the alewife, state management agencies launched a salmonine (i.e., lake trout, Chinook salmon, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and brown trout (Salmo trutta)) stocking program in Lake Michigan in the mid-1960s in an attempt to initiate top-down control of alewives, restore the native lake trout, and initiate a valuable sport fishery (Madenjian et al. 2002).

T1  - Exotic Invasive Species: The Guests That Won't Go Home
AN  - 228747544
AB  - By definition, an invasive exotic species is any species that is not native to that ecosystem, is capable of propagating itself, and whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health.1 Invasive exotic pests are not only plants: animals, fungi, and microorganisms are also players in this threat to biodiversity.  With plants, the incidence of invasiveness appears to follow a pattern known as the Tens Rule, which holds that of every 1,000 nonnative plant species introduced in a region, about 100 will escape to the wild and establish reproductive populations; of that number, 10 species will become firmly established; and 10 percent of those, or one species, will become a problem.7 Nevertheless, the relatively small percentage of introduced species that become invasive can seriously threaten native plants and ecosystems.

T1  - Nearshore-offshore comparison of chlorophyll a and phytoplankton production in the dreissenid-colonized eastern basin of Lake Erie
AN  - 219364295
AB  - Planktonic primary production, chlorophyll a (chl a), underwater light climate, and total phosphorus were measured at 18 stations during 2001 and 2002 in eastern Lake Erie to characterize spatial and seasonal patterns in this system colonized by dreissenid mussels (Dreissena spp.). Areal production rates and chl a displayed a seasonal pattern typical of the Laurentian Great Lakes, with highest production in the early and late summer. Daily and seasonal (May-October) primary production was significantly lower nearshore than offshore. Although light attenuation was similar between nearshore and offshore, the nearshore light climate was generally more favorable for phytoplankton because of shallower mixing depths. However, chl a was significantly lower nearshore, which accounted for most of the depression in production rates. Nearshore chl a was lower than predicted from relationships with total phosphorus in comparable dreissenid-free systems. Offshore, subepilimnetic communities contributed up to 67% of daily production but only up to 19% of seasonal production. The depression of chl a and primary production in the nearshore was a reversal from historic patterns in eastern Lake Erie and from the pattern traditionally expected in large lakes. Decreased external nutrient loading and dreissenid colonization may both have contributed to this new spatial pattern, but dreissenids appear to be key agents. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Historical changes in abundance and community structure of warmwater piscivore communities associated with changes in water clarity, nutrients, and temperature
AN  - 219364993
AB  - In this study, we assess changes in the piscivore community of four large, shallow lakes in the Kawartha Lakes region of central Ontario, Canada, over the period from 1980 to 2003 and relate these changes to temporal trends in phosphorus concentration, water clarity, and temperature. Over the 24-year period of data collection, there has been a regional-scale decline in the relative abundance of walleye (Sander vitreus) and an increase in the relative abundance of bass (Micropterus spp.) species. These changes were associated with reductions in phosphorus concentration and increases in water clarity and summer temperature. Results of a comparative field study conducted on 13 regional lakes indicate significant positive associations between concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a and zooplankton and walleye density. These data suggest that bottom-up effects are limiting walleye abundance either directly or in combination with abiotic conditions that favour bass over walleye. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An Introduction to Ecological Genomics
AN  - 2135000162
AB  - The genomics revolution has expanded from its origins in molecular biology to impact upon every discipline in the life sciences, including ecology. Several ecological questions can be profitably addressed using genomics technology, including issues of nutrient cycling, population structure, life-history variation, trophic interaction, stress responses and the ecological niche. An Introduction to Ecological Genomics focuses on three fundamental ecological questions: 1. What is the relationship between community structure and ecological function in ecosystems? 2. How can the variation in life-history patterns among species be explained from interaction between the genome and the environment? 3. To what extent can the limits of the ecological niche be understood from molecular stress responses? Each of these questions is evaluated in this book, in the light of recent advances in genomics research, paying particular attention to data obtained from sequencing and screening of environmental genomes (metagenomics), microarray-based transcription profiling, and gene expression directed by signal-transduction pathways. The chapters covering these key areas are preceded by discussions of genomics methodology and comparative genomics, and the book concludes with a chapter on integrativeapproaches such as ecological control analysis. An issue receiving particular attention is the genomic study of model species and the extrapolation of data obtained from them to an ecological context. The authors also provide a comparative survey the properties of genomes (genome size, gene families,synteny, polymorphism) for prokaryotes as well as the main eukaryotic models. This book incorporates a multitude of recent examples from microbiology, plant science, and zoology, drawing together a scattered literature in the first synthesis of the new and exciting field of ecological genomics. It will be of particular interest to senior undergraduate and graduate level students, as well as researchers in the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, genetics, and molecular biology.

T1  - Fish predation and trapping for rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) control: a whole-lake experiment
AN  - 219356034
AB  - Improved methods are needed for the prevention and control of invasive species. We investigated the potential to control a rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) population in an isolated lake in northern Wisconsin by trapping adult crayfish and restricting fishing, thereby increasing fish populations and predation on small crayfish. Over a 3 year period, traps and predatory fishes removed substantial portions of the rusty crayfish population. We used an age-structured population model to determine which removal method had the largest effect on crayfish population growth rates. Because more crayfish were vulnerable to and removed by fish predation than by trapping, fish predation caused a larger decline in the population growth rate. However, trapping removed crayfish with the highest reproductive value and caused the largest decline in population growth rate per individual crayfish removed. Consideration of density-dependent responses to removal is necessary to predict long-term effects on rusty crayfish population dynamics. Nonetheless, our results suggest that the combination of trapping and fish predation can control established rusty crayfish populations and deserves further consideration for management.

T1  - Understanding the effects of scuba divers on blackeye goby (Coryphopterus nicholsi) behaviour in a predation risk framework
AN  - 304930031
AB  - Ecotourism activities in which humans experience close contact with animals may affect animal behaviour by eliciting responses analogous to those towards a predatory threat. In addition, an animal's state may affect the form of its response. This thesis examines the effects of the ecotourism activity of SCUBA diving on the behavioural time allocation and reproductive success of the blackeye goby, Coryphopterus nicholsi, in Barkley Sound, on Vancouver Island, Canada. Using remote observation in both field and laboratory experiments, I found that neither long-term behaviour nor reproductive success are affected by ongoing SCUBA diving activity. However, the immediate presence of divers does result in less time allocated to more risky behaviours. No evidence of habituation was found. Size class of gobies affects both behaviour and reproductive success, especially in a predator-free environment. Larger males allocate less time to risky behaviours, and obtain more spawnings from females, than do smaller males.    Key words. Ecotourism; human-caused disturbance; SCUBA diving; Gobiidae; risk-disturbance hypothesis; behavioural time allocation; reproductive success

T1  - The Use Of Cotton Grass As Oil Sorbent In Marine Environmental Protection – Preliminary Results From Experiments
AN  - 2261110169
AB  - We have studied the use of cotton grass, a costless side product of peat excavation, as a sorbent of surface oil slicks in a brackish water environment. Two major experiments were run in 2005, where untreated water from the Gulf of Finland (including plankton organisms) was transported into eight large experiment tanks (400 liters each) and diesel oil, cotton grass, oil-degrading bacteria and nutrients, as well as blue (Mytilus spp.) and zebra (Dreissena sp.) mussels were added in different combinations. We studied the effect of diesel oil on phyto- and zooplankton, mussels, and the applicability of the use of cotton grass for eliminating the detrimental effects of oil on test organisms. The applicability of our results are within oil combating: the more we know about which, how, and in what concentrations key species in the Gulf of Finland ecosystem respond to oil, the better we can design and focus oil combating activities to the most ecologically vulnerable areas. In this paper we will introduce the experiment set-up, measured factors and the first results of our experiments.

T1  - Gorging on gobies: beneficial effects of alien prey on a threatened vertebrate
AN  - 220516372
AB  - Invasive species often have rapid and far-reaching negative impacts on populations and ecological communities. These effects are most common when invasive species have few competitors or predators. Although higher level carnivores do consume invasive species, quantitative effects of new and abundant food sources on predators have rarely been documented and, as a consequence, potentially positive effects of invasive species may be under appreciated. We investigated the effects of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814)) on diet composition, growth rate, and body size of the Lake Erie Water Snake (Nerodia sipedon insularum (Conant and Clay, 1937)), which is threatened in the USA and endangered in Ontario, Canada. Water Snakes have shifted their diet, and round gobies now constitute >92% of prey consumed. This shift in diet has occurred in just one or two Water Snake generations, yet has resulted in more rapid growth and attainment of larger body size in Water Snakes. These positive effects may reduce predation, speed reproductive maturity, increase offspring production, and fuel population growth of this threatened species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The science of mollusc-based art; When Simon Starling throws a statue in Lake Ontario, this is how the magic will happen: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 438916216
AB  - Modern-art darling Simon Starling, this year's winner of Britain's prestigious Turner Prize, is hoping to dunk a replica of Henry Moore's statue The Warrior into Lake Ontario to show how an invasion of zebra mussels has changed the lake's ecosystem.                 Once zebra mussels cover an entire surface, they actually start to grow on top of each other... So the potential is definitely there that there could be layers on layers of zebra mussels.              Barry Gray hamilton spectator In a less ambitious example of mollusc art, zebra mussels cling to an anchor pulled from the lake near Hamilton.

AB  - When the poisonous brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis) was accidentally introduced to the originally snake-free island of Guam in the Pacific Ocean, as a cargo ship stowaway in 1952, it ultimately caused the demise of twelve native bird species.  [...]among the many challenges in invasion biology is the development of tools to identify which exotic species are going to become invasive and where.  [...]an invasion is an interaction between the species' attributes and ecosystem--and the outcomes of interactions are intrinsically hard to predict," says Mark Lonsdale, Assistant Chief of Entomology at the Commonwealth Science and Industry Research Organization in Canberra, Australia.

T1  - Tracking invaders: Series: Invasion on the Lakes: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349178279
AB  - As part of her studies, [Kristina Kostuk] places a trio of traps nearby. They are designed to capture bugs migrating up from the sediment near the fish traps. Typically, Kostuk will gather between 50 and 100 bugs at a site -- mayflies, dragonflies and their ilk. The data should lead to conclusions about how insect populations relate to local fish.

              
   [Pat Chow-Fraser] figures the gobies have followed zebra mussels into the bay. The area's remoteness and the health of its wetlands have limited the spread of zebra mussels, which have caused disastrous disruptions in some areas of the lakes, most notably in Lake Erie. They flourish in areas of nutrient enrichment which comes usually in the form of runoff from human activity.

T1  - Alien Invasions
AN  - 218762209
AB  - Often damage done to ecosystems is irreversible by the time harm has been discovered. As prevention is the first and least costly line of defence, every alien species ought to be treated as potentially invasive unless convincing evidence indicates that is not. An alternative to the reactive "dirty list" approach would be a proactive and precautionary "clean list" approach, whereby government authorities would approve importation, introduction or release only after evidence has been provided showing an alien species will not become invasive or alternatively, that an adequate monitoring and management plan exists for the. foreign species.              Presently no single government department is responsible for addressing invasive alien species in Canada. Responsibility at the federal level is divided between seven different departments based on their different responsibilities.8 It was recognized by the Canadian Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development in 2002 that "no federal department sees the big picture or has overarching authority to ensure that federal priorities are established and action is taken."9 The commissioner recommended radical reforms in government to deal with invasive species comprehensively. Either a co-ordinating agency Within an existing department or a newly created agency needs to be responsible for implementing an invasive alien species program.              If an alien species is invasive it will not stay within the boundaries of an ecosystem, province or nation. For this reason, it is suggested that the problem of invasive alien species must be addressed at the federal level. Common pathways leading to introductions of invasives need to be identified and policies developed to address them in cooperation with various government agencies and other jurisdictions at the national and international level. Most importantly, core funding needs to be allocated for a national invasive species program and the public needs to be educated about changes in behaviour that may reduce alien species introductions.

T1  - Ecology of the Lake Huron fish community, 1970-1999(1)
AN  - 219349093
AB  - We review the status of the Lake Huron fish community between 1970 and 1999 and explore the effects of key stressors. Offshore waters changed little in terms of nutrient enrichment, while phosphorus levels declined in inner Saginaw Bay. Introduced mussels (Dreissena spp.) proliferated and may have caused a decline in Diporeia spp. This introduction could have caused a decline in lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) growth and condition, with serious repercussions for commercial fisheries. Bythotrephes, an exotic predatory cladoceran, and other new exotics may be influencing the fish community. Sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) remained prevalent, but intensive control efforts on the St. Mary's River may reduce their predation on salmonines. Overfishing was less of a problem than in the past, although fishing continued to reduce the amount of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) spawning biomass resulting from hatchery-reared fish planted to rehabilitate this species. Massive stocking programs have increased the abundance of top predators, but lake trout were rehabilitated in only one area. Successful lake trout rehabilitation may require lower densities of introduced pelagic prey fish than were seen in the 1990s, along with continued stocking of hatchery-reared lake trout and control of sea lamprey. Such reductions in prey fish could limit Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) fisheries. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Limits needed: Catch and size limits must be ready for next spring's season: [Final Edition]
AN  - 354855609
AB  - There are also important economic considerations. Tourism brings an estimated $200 million to this area annually, much of it from sport angling. Pickerel are the number one attraction; and not just pickerel, big pickerel - the potential trophy fish that excite experienced anglers.

              
   In 1999, an MNR fish biologist told The Examiner that while fish caught by anglers were getting smaller, the overall pickerel population in the Kawarthas has been stable for 20 years. Yet five years later, the ministry reported the number of pickerel in Rice Lake had dropped to 100,000 from 800,000 over the previous 20 years. The fall-off was nearly as dramatic in Pigeon Lake, and in Lake Ontario's Bay of Quinte.

              
   Zebra mussels, which arrived in the Kawartha Lakes in the early 1990s, are known to be a factor. They live on tiny bits of plankton, which filters the water and makes it clearer. Pickerel have large, light-sensitive eyes and prefer low-light conditions. Clearer water has been good to another invasive species, the black crappie, which push pickerel out of their natural habitat and feed on their just- hatched fry.

T1  - The Comparative Roles of Suspension-Feeders in Ecosystems:&nbsp;Proceedings of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop on the Comparative Roles of Suspension-Feeders in Ecosystems, Nida, Lithuania, 4-9 October 2003
AN  - 2147600673
AB  - Animals are a major link between the water column (pelagic) and the bottom (benthic) habitats in most shallow systems. This coupling is dominated by active processes such as suspension-feeding in which the organism actively uses energy to pump water that is then filtered to remove suspended particles that are consumed while undigested remains are deposited on the bottom. As a result of this feeding on and metabolism of particles, the animals excrete dissolved inorganic and organic waste back into the water column, and thus, become major components in the cycling and feedback of essential elements. With relatively high weight specific filtration rates of 1OCo 10 liters/hour/gram dry tissue and a propensity to form large aggregated populations (beds, reefs, schools and swarms), these organisms can play an important role in regulating water column processes Although estuarine bivalve molluscs such as oysters and mussels dominate the suspension-feeder literature, other groups including plankton and nekton that are found in estuarine as well as other aquatic systems are also potentially important removers of suspended particles. Thus, a significant part of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop focused on suspension-feeders as controllers of plankton abundance, biomass and diversity, system metabolism, nutrient cycling and scale dependency. Systems dominated by suspension-feeders are typically impacted by human activities including recreation, aquaculture, human and industrial pollution, and bilge water from shipping. Suspension-feeders are often impacted by fisheries and over-exploitation. These impacts commonly result in changes in ecosystem structure either through the food chain concentration of harmful substances or diseases, the introduction of alien species of suspension-feeders, or the instability of suspension-feeders systems through species displacement or phase shifts in the dominance between different suspension-feeding components such as nekton or zooplankton. These issues were addressed near the close of the workshop along with conclusions and syntheses developed by the working groups."

As a result of this feeding on and metabolism of particles, the animals excrete dissolved inorganic and organic waste back into the water column, and thus, become major components in the cycling and feedback of essential elements. With relatively high weight specific filtration rates of 1-- 10 liters/hour/gram dry tissue and a propensity to form large aggregated populations (beds, reefs, schools and swarms), these organisms can play an important role in regulating water column processes 
Although estuarine bivalve molluscs such as oysters and mussels dominate the suspension-feeder literature, other groups including plankton and nekton that are found in estuarine as well as other aquatic systems are also potentially important removers of suspended particles. Thus, a significant part of the NATO Advanced Research Workshop focused on suspension-feeders as controllers of plankton abundance, biomass and diversity, system metabolism, nutrient cycling and scale dependency. 
Systems dominated by suspension-feeders are typically impacted by human activities including recreation, aquaculture, human and industrial pollution, and bilge water from shipping. Suspension-feeders are often impacted by fisheries and over-exploitation. These impacts commonly result in changes in ecosystem structure either through the food chain concentration of harmful substances or diseases, the introduction of alien species of suspension-feeders, or the instability of suspension-feeders systems through species displacement or phase shifts in the dominance between different suspension-feeding components such as nekton or zooplankton. These issues were addressed near the close of the workshop along with conclusions and syntheses developed by the working groups.

T1  - Biology of Lakes and Ponds
AN  - 2131376471
AB  - `his concise yet comprehensive introduction to the biology of standing waters (lakes and ponds) combines traditional limnology with current ecological and evolutionary theory. It integrates the effects of abiotic constraints and biotic interactions at both the population and community level, allowing the reader to understand how the distribution and success of different organisms in this freshwater habitat can be explained and predicted. The book is focused on temperate lakes andponds, drawing on examples from polar and tropical systems to provide a broader context. The Biology of Lakes and Ponds, now in its second edition, will be a valuable text for university tuition. However, its lucid explanations and descriptions of adaptation, dominance, dispersal, and succession of organisms, as well as the effects of abiotic factors, predation, and competition, ensure its relevance and use to a broad audience of biologists and naturalists with an interest in freshwater ecology.

T1  - The limits of science in determining environmental priorities
AN  - 305374384
AB  - The dissertation examines the influence exerted by government's own experts, particularly natural, social and applied scientists, in the making of environmental policy. It focuses on the priorities for environmental policy, rather than the policies themselves, and addresses the question of how and under what conditions expertise resonates within environmental priority setting.    The research involved an extended case study within Environment Canada, between the years 1992 and 1995. In particular, it examined the Environment Canada Project Plan as it moved through its various stages of development, implementation and finally, failure to be approved. It examined other projects also proposed and possibly implemented during the same time period.    Based on an extensive collection of documents, including internal departmental memos provided to this research, interviews and participant observation, it was observed that government experts were not always influential even in situations where the professed method of policy making was “science-based.” The readily available government experts were not always asked for their advice, nor were they always listened to even when they were asked.    A great deal of expert influence, or lack of influence, can be accounted for by serendipity, the effect of particular individuals in particular positions at particular moments in time.    The overall conclusion of the research is that, despite adherence to the value of “science-based” decision-making, policy making (at least in this instance) was not science-based in any significant measure. Even in the setting of priorities for attention, and even in the field of the environment, policy making remains mainly responsive to factors other than science.    The dissertation concludes by suggesting that greater emphasis on “science-based” policy making might go some distance to redressing the lack of influence of government experts. The discussion of specific policies might also be widened to allow people other than government officials to participate. It may well be that more attention to the contribution of experts might occur were the public involved in pressing for “science-based” policy.

T1  - Energetic consequences of diet shifts in Lake Erie rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)
AN  - 219344738
AB  - The diet of eastern Lake Erie rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) has changed since the 1960s, reflecting food resource shifts due to phosphorus reductions and the invasion of exotic species (dreissenid mussels and Bythotrephes longimanus). Since rainbow smelt growth was lower in the 1990s than in the 1960s, we considered diet changes as an explanation. A decrease in the proportion of zooplankton occurred in the summer (May-August) diet of two size classes (63-88 and 89-114 mm fork length) between 1961 and 1999. Within the zooplankton, the proportion of Bythotrephes increased. In spite of these changes, energy density (joules per gram) of the summer (June-August) diet has not changed since 1961. However, during the late-summer and fall, predation on Bythotrephes, and therefore the proportion of indigestible spines in the stomach, increases. Using bioenergetics models, we show that Lake Erie rainbow smelt could achieve 66%-155% greater growth between June and October if Bythotrephes spines were replaced with digestible prey items, resulting in end-of-season weights and lengths similar to the 1985-1990 period. Our results indicate that indigestible Bythotrephes spines may reduce growth by occupying space in the stomach but providing no nutritional value to the fish, thereby reducing the realized daily ration for rainbow smelt.

T1  - Agonism and shelter competition between invasive and indigenous crayfish species
AN  - 220528176
AB  - Several crayfish species behave as biological invaders. Their establishment in an area has frequently been accompanied by the reduction or elimination of indigenous species. A laboratory study was designed to investigate whether the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) is dominant over the indigenous (to Delaware) crayfish Procambarus acutus acutus (Girard, 1852) in either the absence or the presence of a shelter as a limited resource. As expected, we found that P. clarkii is more aggressive than the similarly sized P. a. acutus, thus confirming previous studies that demonstrated an inherent dominance of the invasive over the indigenous crayfish. We then hypothesized that species showing a lower preference for an offered shelter (P. clarkii) should be less motivated to defend it. To the contrary, in a competitive context P. clarkii excluded P. a. acutus from the shelter but did not use the resource. Caution must be used in extrapolating these laboratory studies to the field, and future studies should analyze multiple factors, including the autoecology of the two species and their reproductive potential and recruitment patterns. However, our results might help in highlighting the risks for freshwater biodiversity created by the uncontrolled translocations of P. clarkii and other similar invasive species.

T1  - A long-term rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) invasion: dispersal patterns and community change in a north temperate lake
AN  - 219305289
AB  - Rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) were first observed in Trout Lake, Wisconsin, in 1979 and took 19 years to completely disperse around the littoral zone, advancing at an average rate of 0.68 km.year^sup -1^. With the invasion of rusty crayfish, we found that fishes that share prey taxa with crayfish declined in numbers over time, but piscivorous fish species did not change in abundance. Snails declined from >10 000 to <5 snails.m^sup -2^ in one of the first invaded areas. Mean abundance of Odonata, Amphipoda, and Trichoptera decreased significantly lake-wide. Resident crayfish species nearly disappeared, although total crayfish abundance, driven by high abundances of rusty crayfish, continued to rise. Submerged macrophyte species richness declined by as much as 80% at some locations. Together these responses demonstrate dramatic long-term changes in the littoral zone biota of Trout Lake. Continued invasions of similar lakes in the region suggest that these impacts are occurring on a region-wide basis with potentially irreversible effects on communities and ecosystems. Only through long-term natural experiments such as this study can researchers ascertain the full extent of invasions and their impacts on community and ecosystem process that respond at spatial and temporal scales not captured in mesocosm studies.

T1  - Nonnative Oysters in the Chesapeake Bay
AN  - 2131813158
AB  - The second edition of Smart Kids With Learning Difficulties is an updated and comprehensive must-read for parents, teachers, counselors, and other support professionals of bright kids who face learning challenges every day. This practical book discusses who these students are; how to identify them; what needs to be implemented; best practices, programs, and services; and specific actions to ensure student success. Along with tools and tips, each chapter includes Key Points,a new feature that will help focus and facilitate next steps, and desired outcomes and follow-up for parents and teachers. The new edition includes a look at current definitions of twice-exceptional students; updated research findings and identification methods; a detailed description of the laws and policies impacting this population; what works and what doesn't work; model schools; Response to Intervention; Understanding by Design; comprehensive assessments; social-emotional principles; and new assistive technology.
Nonnative Oysters in the Chesapeake Bay discusses the proposed plan to offset the dramatic decline in the bay's native oysters by introducing disease-resistant reproductive Suminoe oysters from Asia. It suggests this move should be delayed until more is known about the environmental risks, even though carefully regulated cultivation of sterile Asian oysters in contained areas could help the local industry and researchers. It is also noted that even though these oysters eat the excess algae caused by pollution, it could take decades before there are enough of them to improve water quality.

T1  - Neon:&nbsp;Addressing the Nation's Environmental Challenges
AN  - 2132092295
AB  - The book endorses the National Science Foundation's concept of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) for providing a nationwide network of facilities and infrastructure for ecological and environmental research that is impossible with existing infrastructure. The committee identified six grand challenges in environmental biology - biodiversity, biogeochemical cycles, climate change, ecology and evolution of infectious diseases, invasive species and land and habitat use -- that deserves high priority for research and needs to be addressed on a regional or continental scale. However, the book says that NEON needs a refined focus and a more detailed plan for its implementation to ensure the maximization of its contribution to science and to better fit within the purview of Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction funding.

T1  - Timing of pairing in Harlequin Ducks: Interaction of spacing behaviour, time budgets, and the influx of herring spawn
AN  - 305086111
AB  - This thesis had two major objectives. The first was to test predictions of previous and new theories to explain variation in the timing of pair formation in waterfowl by investigating how several aspects of the winter ecology of Harlequin Ducks, including distribution and spacing behaviour, time-activity budgets, and the use of herring spawn, may be related to the process of mate choice and the timing of pair formation. The second was to identify and address some of the gaps in our knowledge of the winter ecology and demography of Harlequin Ducks that currently handicap effective conservation action. Previous theory to account for variation in the timing of pairing, that primarily considered how phenotypic, social, and ecological factors affect male costs, poorly predicted pairing behaviour in Harlequin Ducks and other waterfowl. Female Harlequin Ducks invested considerable time and energy into selecting a mate, and decisions by females about how much time and energy to allocate to the pairing process appeared to be the main factor controlling the timing of pairing. Those decisions were affected by age, previous pairing experience, time required for other activities due to seasonal differences in day-length and food availability, and group spacing that affected the availability and likely the costs of mate sampling and in turn was also related to food availability. Spacing behaviour supported the hypothesis that unpaired birds will show adaptive changes in their spacing to reduce the costs of mate sampling. Aggregating at herring spawning sites in March provided birds with both direct nutritional benefits and indirect benefits related to changes in time budgets and spacing behaviour. Male and female interests necessarily interacted and a comprehensive theory to predict variation in pairing behaviour in waterfowl and other species requires consideration of benefits, costs, and conflicts of interest among individuals engaged in pairing decisions. The process of making mate-choice decisions, how the interactions of phenotypic, social, and ecological conditions affect that process, and how individuals integrate that process with other requirements of their life history are essential to consider in order to understand variation in the timing of pairing events.

T1  - The upland hardwood component of Prince Edward Island's remnant Acadian forest: determination of depth of edge and patterns of exotic plant invasion
AN  - 218605579
AB  - The upland hardwood component of Prince Edward Island's Acadian forest is among the best remaining examples of the precolonial landscape, but it has been severely fragmented during the past 300 years of human use and settlement. Despite the ecological importance of this remnant habitat and its level of fragmentation, there has been no assessment of depth of edge or exotic plant invasion in these areas. Three 300 m long edge-interior transects were established in each of six study sites. Nine 100-m^sup 2^ circular plots were sampled along each transect at distances from 5.7 to 300 m; one external plot was established at each transect to sample species in adjacent habitats. In each plot, all vascular plants were identified, a visual estimate of percent cover was made, and soil temperature, canopy cover, and tree diameters were measured. An edge-interior plant community gradient was found within these forests; a plant community characteristic of interior conditions was not reached until a distance of more than 120 m from an edge. This suggests that upland hardwood protected areas smaller than 240 m on a side (5.75 ha) are unlikely to include interior habitat, and sites should be greater than 320 m on all sides (10.24 ha) to ensure at least some interior habitat for vascular plants. Invasion by exotic species was found to be more extensive than that reported from other jurisdictions, and innermost (300 m) plots were not free from exotics. Fifteen exotic species were found within the study sites, with Veronica officinalis (common speedwell) and Hieracium lachenalii (hawkweed) being the most invasive, both in terms of distance penetrated and area covered. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]              Key words: Acadian forest, fragmentation, depth of edge, protected area, Veronica, Hieracium.

T1  - Pickerel face danger from invading fish: [Final Edition]
AN  - 351751661
AB  - The pickerel appears to be losing its habitat to a growing population of invading blue gill and black crappie, panfish species that have been multiplying since first noticed in the Kawarthas about 20 years ago.

              
   Another invading species, the zebra mussel, appears to be at the helm of this major shift, creating habitat that's right for the invading panfish, but wrong for pickerel.

              
   [Dave Brown] and federation fisheries biologist Francine MacDonald said pickerel appear to have "disappeared" from other traditional hot spots in Lake Erie and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario, areas that are also heavy with zebra mussels.

T1  - Meltdown: Invading species are rewriting the book of life in the lakes Series: Troubled Waters: [Final Edition]
AN  - 361255197
AB  - "Not much else feeds on the zebra mussels other than gobies, which are now one of the most abundant fish in the lakes and available to be fed upon by other fish and birds," says [Anthony Ricciardi], who believes the type-E botulism itself may not be indigenous to the basin. "So, the gobies act as a bio-accumulation link for the bacteria.

T1  - Meltdown: Invasive species taking over the neighbourhood: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359452687
AB  - By 1997, these zebra mussels had cleared so much of lakes that [Kimberly Monk] had a pristine view of shipwrecks like the Sligo -- a St. Catharines built vessel that sank off Toronto in the 19th century.                 [Anthony Ricciardi], who testified before the committee as it was preparing its report, says there are successes in combating alien invaders. In Australia's Darwin Harbour an infestation of black-striped mussels - - a creature similar to zebra mussels -- was wiped out in 1999.

T1  - The use of program theory for identifying and evaluating ‘best practices’ for implementing land-use policies
AN  - 305260938
AB  - Over the past decade, land-use planning in British Columbia has matured into the current, integrated land and resource-planning regime. Such an integrated planning approach attempts to balance environmental, economic, and social objectives to achieve sustainable use of the existing land-base. Moreover, planning activities such as these necessarily encompass a wide range of interests and stakeholders, as well as addressing a multitude of complex issues. Since most of the provincial plans initiated are now completed, attention is turning to the implementation phase, during which these consensus-based plans are instituted on the ground.    This report identifies the best implementation practices that should be used for implementing such land-use policies. Evaluating the best practices used by selected North American agencies—Bay Conservation and Development Commission, Fraser Basin Council, Land Conservation and Development Commission, Puget Sound Water Quality Action Team, and United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service—identifies which implementation practices are most critical to achieving policy objectives.

T1  - Mussels suspected for lake 'dead zone': [Final Edition]
AN  - 349437813
AB  - [Gerald Matisoff], a Case Western Reserve University professor, and Hunter Carrick of Penn State University have spent the summer on a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency research vessel trying to figure out what is causing a growing summer "dead zone" on the lake.

              
   Researchers have a "working hypothesis" that "the basic ecosystem of the lake has been significantly modified" by the presence of quagga mussels, an invasive species related to the zebra mussel, Matisoff said.

              
   While the mussels are a prime suspect for the dead zone, there may be other contributing factors. The water levels in the Great Lakes have been dropping, which could be changing the chemistry of the water. In addition, Matisoff said, it is possible sewage and agricultural runoff are depositing more nutrients into the lake than EPA data suggests.

T1  - Stalking the critters of the... deep: [Final Edition]
AN  - 270113202
AB  - The murkiness results, [Ralph Smith] suspects, from small particles sucked up by mussels in the shallow, nearshore areas that stay there and don't wash back out to deeper water. In addition, their fecal waste acts as fertilizer for algae that's becoming a nuisance on beaches.                 WHAT'S GOING ON BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE GREAT LAKES? - First it was zebra mussels. Then came oceangoing ships carrying more tiny bodies -- mingling species that had existed for millions of years without ever making contact. Now, Great Lakes scientists are trying to discover who they are and what they're doing to us.              Photo: Photos by Ron Pozzer, the Hamilton Spectator; A new 'dead zone' has been found in Lake Erie, which struggled back from contamination before. The latest dead zone is blamed on zebra and quagga mussels.; Photo:

T1  - Patterns and mechanisms of aquatic invertebrate introductions in the Ponto-Caspian region
AN  - 219297131
AB  - The Black, Azov, and Caspian sea drainages (i.e., Ponto-Caspian region) have an extensive and long history of species introductions. Here we review patterns and mechanisms of introductions of aquatic invertebrate species into these ecosystems. Since the late 1800s, 136 free-living and 27 parasitic invertebrate species have been introduced outside their native ranges and have established reproducing populations in the Ponto-Caspian region. The bulk of these introductions are represented by crustaceans (53%), flatworms (15%), and molluscs (13%). Most of the introduced species are native to other areas within the Ponto-Caspian region (37%), with other sizable contributions from the Atlantic-Mediterranean (15%) and boreal European-Siberian (14%) geographic regions. Mechanisms of introductions were dominated by deliberate releases (29%) and shipping activities (22%), with the former occurring principally in freshwater habitats and the latter in marine and estuarine ones. Other introductions resulted from unintentional release (21%) and hydrotechnical development (14%), notably the construction of reservoirs and canals. Global and regional trade, particularly that mediated by commercial ships, provides dispersal opportunities for nonindigenous invertebrates to and within the Ponto-Caspian region, rapidly changing the composition of its endemic fauna.

T1  - Distribution of phthalate esters in a marine food web
AN  - 305471507
AB  - Phthalate esters (PEs) are widely used chemicals, with over 4 million tonnes being produced worldwide each year. To investigate PE bioaccumulation in a marine food web, a field study was conducted in False Creek Harbour, Vancouver, Canada. The study involved collecting samples of seawater, sediment and eighteen marine species. Samples were analyzed by GC-LRMS for eight individual phthalate congeners (i.e., dimethyl, diethyl, di-iso-butyl, di-n-butyl, butyl-benzyl, di(2-ethylhexyl), di-n-octyl, di-n-nonyl), and by LC-ESI/MS for five isomeric mixtures (i.e., di-iso-hexyl (C6), di-iso-heptyl (C7), di-iso-octyl (C8), di-iso-nonyl (C9), di-iso-decyl (C10)). Environmental concentrations were determined and corresponding fugacities were calculated. PE fugacities in the sediment were greater than those in the freely dissolved water fraction. The degree of sediment-water disequilibrium decreased with K OW from a factor of 17,700 for dimethyl phthalate to values between 2.7 and 44 for the other twelve PEs. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - The Bioaccumulation of Metals and the Induction of Moulting in the Blue Swimmer Crab, Portunus Pelagicus (Linnaeus 1766)
AN  - 3039733194
AB  - This thesis presents work outlining the development of the Blue Swimmer Crab (Portunus pelagicus) as a biomonitor of available cadmium and also presents a proposed method for the production of “soft-shelled crabs” utilising P. pelagicus.The first experiments established that the Blue Swimmer Crab accumulates only cadmium in the hepatopancreas after being presented elevated levels of the metals Cd, Cu, Zn, As, Fe and Al via a food source, the mussel Trychomya hirsuta. Over eight weeks, crabs were fed a controlled diet to determine the accumulation of metals. Significant (p = 0.05) Cd accumulation was detected after four weeks of feeding. Food mussels were sourced from either “contaminated” or “uncontaminated” sites. Mussels from uncontaminated sites had an average Cd level of 0.07 µg/g wet weight and contaminated mussels had an average of 5.2 µg/g wet weight.Having established that the crab accumulated cadmium it was then necessary to determine the animal’s residency in a given area for it to reflect the available cadmium associated with a particular spatial scale. To do this it was necessary to test and develop a suitable tag for use in population studies. When applied as tested the standard “T” bar anchor tag (Hallprint Australia TBA-1, TBA-2), similar to the Floy anchor tag, was not successful for tagging P. pelagicus. A modified “T” Bar anchor tag, with the labeled barrel extending almost the complete length of the tag, was developed and data presented which show this tag to be superior for use with P. pelagicus.The development of this tag then allowed the conduct of a series of population studies to assess the residence of P. pelagicus in estuarine areas. The distribution of P. pelagicuswas found to equate with depth. This distribution results in a series of geographically distinct populations in the small bays along the Cowan Creek estuary during summer. Mark-recapture assessments in one of these bays, using the Weighted Mean Method over four consecutive capture release days, on two assessment periods, gave population estimates of 26.0 (±14.9) and 15.2 (±7.6). On two other sampling occasions during winter no crabs were captured suggesting the animals either move to deeper waters during colder months or lower their metabolism and remain in the sediment for these periods.During the population assessment work late stage berried females in the study area raised the question of female crab movements relating to the release of egg masses. An initial survey of the plankton for P. pelagicus larvae suggested that the life cycle could be similar to other swimming crabs such as the Blue Crab, Callinectes sapidus, which moves to the mouths of estuaries and releases larvae on the out going tide. This information casts some doubt on the residency of berried females and their use as a biomonitor of available cadmium.Previous work had established that this animal could accumulate cadmium and was at least resident on a scale of estuaries during summer months; the organism was then employed as a biomonitor of environmental cadmium levels. By examining the level of cadmium accumulation in the hepatopancreas of P. pelagicus, a number of New South Wales estuaries were assessed forpotential contamination by this metal. Crabs assessed from Lake Macquarie, on the New South Wales central coast, were found to be significantly (p<0.05) higher in cadmium in the hepatopancreas than levels found in crabs in other estuaries. This result is consistent with other studies which reflect metal contamination of the Lake by a number of industrial and domestic sources. Thus proving the utility of the Blue Swimmer Crab as a biomonitor of available cadmium in estuaries. Potential methods for the production of soft-shelled crabs were trialled using P. pelagicus. It was found that crabs held physically separated in a single aquaria, with both eyestalks ablated, resulted in the highest percentage of crabs moulting per unit time, (mean of 48% as opposed to 20% for controls). Crabs held as individuals, and completely isolated from others, again with both eyestalks ablated, resulted in the fastest mean days to moult when compared to crabs held in groups with double eyestalk ablation (19.0 days +/- 2.4). The injection of moulting hormone, 300C temperatures, single eyestalk ablation and male only treatments were found to have little effect on the initiation of moulting in this species.A method for the treatment and holding of P. pelagicusfor the production of softshelled crabs is proposed.

T1  - Creating an Environmental Education Website at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center
AN  - 2030074180
AB  - This report describes my 16-week internship at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC) in Edgewater, MD, where I started on 29 January 2001 as an "Education Specialist/Web Developer" at SERC's education department. I was responsible for the website for the Education Department and for a website related to Watershed Radio, an environmental education project about the Chesapeake Bay watershed. In this report, I describe the five phases of the development of the website, namely the 1) Information Planning Phase; 2) Content-Specification Phase; 3) Implementation Phase; 4) Production Phase; and 5) Evaluation Phase. I also discuss the difference between education and advocacy and how the combination of a non-contextualized model and a website-specific tutorial provides a good basis for developing a website. The internship report ends with the conclusion that my internship was successful; although I could have done a better job of planning and managing my project, I delivered a well-received product, learned a lot, and worked with great colleagues at an interesting organization.

T1  - Invasive Alien Species:&nbsp;A Toolkit of Best Prevention and Management Practices
AN  - 2131195417
AB  - Human activities have contributed to the distribution of many plant, animal and microbial species to parts of the world where they are not native. This spread of alien species can have devastating consequences on native biodiversity. Examples include alien mammals consuming native vegetation and alien insects spreading viruses, as well as plants such as water hyacinth, which has caused major problems to waterways when introduced from South America. The Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP) was established to address concerns with alien invasive species, formulated in the Convention on Biological Diversity, GISP is coordinated by: the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE); the World Conservation Union (ICUN); and CAB International. Its goal is to improve prevention and management of biological invasions, and this book represents a key outcome. It has been assembled by a team of international experts. Features include: case studies from around the globe, with some emphasis on islands; a focus on biodiversity, but with some consideration of traditional agriculture; advice on national management plans, including risk analysis.

T1  - Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates
AN  - 2131785831
AB  - The First Edition of Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates has been immensely popular with students and researchers interested in freshwater biology and ecology, limnology, environmental science, invertebrate zoology, and related fields. The First Edition has been widely used as a textbook and this Second Edition should continue to serve students in advanced classes. The Second Edition features expanded and updated chapters, especially with respect to the cited references and the classification of North American freshwater invertebrates. New chapters or substantially revised chapters include those on freshwater ecosystems, snails, aquatic spiders, aquatic insects, and crustaceans.  Most up-to-date and informative text of its kind Written by experts in the ecology of various invertebrate groups, coverage emphasizes ecological information within a current taxonomic framework Each chapter contains both morphological and taxonomic information, including keys to North American taxa (usually to the generic level) as well as bibliographic information and a list of further readings The text is geared toward researchers and advanced undergraduate and graduate students

T1  - Salmonine Introductions to the Laurentian Great Lakes:&nbsp;An Historical Review and Evaluation of Ecological Effects
AN  - 2131038259
AB  - This publication provides an historical review and evaluation of documented ecological effects associated with salmonine introductions to the Laurentian Great Lakes. The introduction of salmonines to the Great Lakes date back to the 1870s, when natural populations of native salmonines in the Great Lakes were in severe decline. 
 Using established evaluation protocols, it was determined that there is evidence of significant ecological effects in six different categories: (1) diseases and parasites, (2) predation on native species, (3) competition for limiting resources, (4) genetic alteration, (5) environmental alteration and (6) community alteration. Taken together, this body of evidence supports the conclusion that the ongoing introduction of non-native salmonines poses an ecologically-significant risk to the Great Lakes ecosystem and its native organisms, and that the introductions should be terminated.

T1  - Voices for the Watershed:&nbsp;Environmental Issues in the Great Lakes-St Lawrence Drainage Basin
AN  - 2131398188
AB  - Voices for the Watershed is a unique look at the singular and ecologically inter-connected region of the Great Lakes-St Lawrence watershed, including the headwater and upland regions. With contributions from experts from the United States, Quebec, and Ontario, this book offers an accessible introduction to the issues affecting the quality of our most essential and precious of natural resources - clean, fresh water - from headwater regions downstream to the Great lakes, the St Lawrence river, and ultimately the watershed's outflow to the sea. With thoughtful words and evocative photography, Voices for the Watershed promotes understanding and examines ecological problems, describing positive environmental actions and projects as well as ongoing concerns over the effects of pollution on wildlife and human health. The underlying themes throughout are that the drainage basins and ecosystems are under siege - from reckless land use decisions, soil erosion, acid rain, and massive habitat destruction - but that the situation is not hopeless. The authors feel strongly that education about the environmental threats - in the classroom and public forums - is essential to effecting positive change, and that conservation actions by citizen groups and individuals can be a driving force in effecting substantial reforms regarding environmental legislation and practices. Voices for the Watershed is an eye-opening look at not only the problems but possible solutions to help protect and preserve this resilient natural resource on which so many depend.

T1  - Why we shouldn't let the bugs in: [National Edition]
AN  - 329714290
AB  - In a recent column on these pages, Ron Bailey questions whether our ecosystems are really under attack by non-native species, and whether we should care if they are. Mr. Bailey makes use of Mark Sagoff's controversial views to suggest that non-native species are being unjustly targeted by ecologists even though they may generally cause no greater harm than native pests. Does the possibility that introduced Asian or Brown long-horn beetles will cause no greater damage than native spruce budworms mean attempts should not be made to eradicate the former? We think not. These species have the potential to cause serious economic and ecological harm to Canadian forests, and reasonable efforts ought to be made to eliminate such invaders. The fact that some type of vegetation would grow in place of tree species destroyed by exotic pests should provide us with little comfort. Unintentional introductions of pests by humans have dramatically changed the "face" of forests in eastern North America, with major losses of formerly dominant American chestnut and American elm. Certainly, native pests are costly, but we are adding to this pool with ever-increasing numbers of non-native pests; as a result, more than half (US$35-billion) the economic losses to U.S. crop production due to insect pests and plant diseases are caused by introduced species.

T1  - Waiting for the unwary: Human inadvertence will probably bring to the Great Lakes a weed that knows no limits: [National Edition]
AN  - 329687143
AB  - A hydrilla infestation swiftly obliterates the habitat of the fish and other creatures that live in the water and makes swimming, boating and fishing impossible. In Florida and elsewhere, the primary, albeit severely limited, remedies are herbicides and mechanical harvesters. Researchers have considered enlisting hydrilla-eating fish and insects and even manatees and cows, but these have proved to be, at best, of little use. Hydrilla has now spread across the southern U.S. to California and has recently appeared in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Washington State.                 More about Great Lakes invaders can be found at the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters' site, www.ofah.org; and at www.glc.great-lakes.org, which will get you into the Great Lakes Information Network. These sites are part of a continuous campaign to tell people that exotic invaders almost always arrive here with human help.                 "You can't really let up on it," says Alan Dextrase, an introductions biologist with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. "Last week I got a call from someone who thought zebra mussels were no longer a problem because he hadn't been reading about them in the papers. They probably aren't as newsworthy as they were when they first invaded, but there always seems to be another species, like hydrilla, around the corner, and zebra mussels are certainly still spreading in Ontario."

T1  - The political economy of the Great Lakes
AN  - 304671601
AB  - This dissertation reviews the history of Great Lakes region from its geological development through the end of the 20th century. It evaluates institutional changes and their effects on water quality issues. It begins with an introduction of property rights and their importance in a market economy. The paper provides a brief history and description of the physical characteristics of the lakes. The history of regulation in the Great Lakes is explained from the early common law remedies to centralized legislative control beginning in the 1970's. Cost data show that the command and control policies used to control pollution in the Great Lakes are cost-ineffective and Pareto-inefficient. The failure of regulation to meet environmental goals a explained by reference to public choice theory. Centralized, control of the Great Lakes does not provide the incentive structure allocate resources efficiently. The author recommends privatization of the Great Lakes as a means of controlling externalities and of providing incentives to overcome information problems.

T1  - Female and male reproductive strategies in the red -necked phalarope, a polyandrous shorebird
AN  - 304662538
AB  - I examined female and male reproductive strategies in a colour-banded population of Red-necked Phalaropes (Phalaropus lobatus) in a 10 year study in western Alaska. This study examined: (1) seasonal variation in reproductive strategies, (2) sex allocation, (3) paternity, and (4) factors limiting polyandry. Although only a small proportion (10%) of females became polyandrous, first mates of these females often benefited (50% of cases) by fertilizing an egg in clutches incubated by second males. I found costs for both sexes associated with early nesting, however, including: smaller egg size, longer time to produce a clutch, and longer incubation duration. Eggs laid early in the season were exposed to predators up to 42% longer than those in later nests, and predation on nests tended to be greater towards the start and end of the nesting season. Polyandrous females were in better body condition initially, showed no seasonal trend in body condition, and produced larger eggs, and proportionately more male chicks than monogamous females. DNA analyses showed that extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs) were low overall: 1.7% of 226 chicks, with one chick in each of 4 out of 63 total clutches. Second males of polyandrous females faced substantial risk, however, with 3 of 6 such clutches containing EPF young, in contrast to no EPF young in a female's first clutch (n = 25) and only 1 in 16 monogamous replacement clutches. Males appear to pursue a mixed reproductive strategy. They mate guard strongly, by approaching and accompanying females more often than reported for other shorebirds. Males increase within-pair copulation attempts coincident with the female's fertile period, but further increase attempts beyond the fertile period, apparently in an attempt to fertilize the next clutch. Renesting males guard against cuckoldry risk by repairing with their original females or by leaving the area. Although 76% of polyandrous nestings involved renesting males, only 6% of renesting males changed mates if the original female was still available. Moreover, polyandry rates did not increase with an increase in males recycled into the breeding pool. I conclude that the breeding system of phalaropes is fundamentally a renesting system that favors male incubation, and that polyandry occurs primarily when original females are unavailable to renesting males.

T1  - FISH STUNNED TO TEST LAKE'S HEALTH MINISTRY ANALYSIS OF TISSUE OF ERIE SPECIES SHOWS WATER IMPROVING: [FINAL EDITION]
AN  - 269954182
AB  - From April to September, the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR) has been using a $40,000 electro-fishing boat to study the diversity and number of fish species in a changing habitat, said Larry Halyk, lead biologist with the MNR's Lake Erie management unit during a recent media demonstration of the boat in Fort Erie.                 The habitat in the river and Lake Erie is changing because zebra mussels have been feeding on algae, which is making the water clearer. Industries that have been dumping pollutants like phosphates into the water for years have also been doing their part. They have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in an effort to clean up their act since a bi-national agreement was signed in 1987.                 MNR wildlife biologist Anne Yagi said that before zebra mussels were unexpectedly introduced to the Great Lakes about 20 years ago, a person looking into the murky depths of Lake Erie and the Niagara River could see no more than one metre. Now visibility extends up to 14 metres.

T1  - Sex ratio and physiological indicators of reproduction in the marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus)
AN  - 304572368
AB  - Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus) are atypical alcids (family Alcidae) in that they nest predominantly in large trees ($>$81 cm diameter at breast height) in coastal old-growth coniferous forests. In recent years, population declines have been speculated over much of the Marbled Murrelet's range resulting in its classification as a "threatened" species in Canada. Marbled Murrelets are difficult to study due to their cryptic nesting behaviour, sensitivity to disturbance, and habitat requirements that typically restrict them to relatively isolated and inaccessible locations. Traditional methods of studying the population dynamics of seabirds, such as the regular visitation of large numbers of nests, are therefore not readily applicable to the Marbled Murrelet, and as a result, little is known about their ecology and breeding biology. The primary goal of my research was to test and develop novel molecular and physiological techniques that could indirectly provide information about the breeding biology of the Marbled Murrelet.

T1  - Invaders: Exotic species infiltrating the Great Lakes are threatening to destroy the world's most valuable commercial freshwater fishery: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349185139
AB  - - Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus cernuus): More aggressive, with a higher reproductive potential than its commercially valuable cousins, walleye and perch. It comes from the Danube River and the Black Sea. First appeared in the Duluth Harbour, Minn., in 1986 and led to "dramatic" declines of such native species as yellow perch. Currently in northern Lake Huron but unconfirmed reports from anglers point to its presence in Lake Erie, much of which is ideal ruffe habitat -- warm and shallow.

T1  - Ecological scare stories ignore basics of nature: [Final Edition]
AN  - 275633296
AB  - That doesn't mean that the purple loosestrife, for instance, isn't threatening wetlands. In an attempt to contain the vibrantly colored plant, biologists have introduced European beetles that are, even now, munching through stands of loosestrife across southern Ontario. It will take several years to see if this works.                 Meanwhile, the war against purple loosestrife has been spearheaded by Ducks Unlimited, a group primarily concerned with maintaining healthy wetlands for the ducks they like to kill. As for the zebra mussel, environmentalist R.G Davis has written that it has "disturbed commercial, industrial and municipal uses of the Great Lakes, but this is not the mollusk's fault. Only industrial and commercial use and abuse of the waters makes the zebra mussel a pest."              Canadian Press Forget big, green monsters, we've got zebra mussels invading our lakes, loosestrife destroying wetlands, and now "greedy" goby feasting on innocent yellow perch. Last summer, Don MacIvor, of Shelburne, Ont., and his son Danny (left), introduced Galerucella beetles to a field of purple loosestrife in Cambridge. The European beetles are munching their way through stands of loosestrife across southern Ontario to save the wetlands.

T1  - Lake Erie walleye top yellow perch: [Final Edition]
AN  - 254266314
AB  - Even there the cleaner water is playing havoc with sport anglers. As Lake Erie cleans up, biologists and the angling community have noticed walleye becoming more sensitive and moving away from the shoreline areas and into less-accessible deeper waters.                 Yellow perch has been displaced by walleye, long the prize of the local sport fishery, as the bread and butter catch of what is a $150- million industry for shoreline communities in Essex and Kent counties. Success in battling pollution and nutrient overloading in the water, as well as invasions by such exotic species as zebra and quagga mussels, are credited with clearing up Lake Erie's water.

T1  - Freshwater Ecosystems:&nbsp;Revitalizing Educational Programs in Limnology
AN  - 2131202622
AB  - To fulfill its commitment to clean water, the United States depends on limnology, a multidisciplinary science that seeks to understand the behavior of freshwater bodies by integrating aspects of all basic sciences--from chemistry and fluid mechanics to botany, ichthyology, and microbiology. Now, prominent limnologists are concerned about this important field, citing the lack of adequate educational programs and other issues. Freshwater Ecosystems responds with recommendations for strengthening the field and ensuring the readiness of the next generation of practitioners. Highlighted with case studies, this book explores limnology's place in the university structure and the need for curriculum reform, with concrete suggestions for curricula and field research at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. The volume examines the wide-ranging career opportunities for limnologists and recommends strategies for integrating limnology more fully into water resource decision management. Freshwater Ecosystems tells the story of limnology and its most prominent practitioners and examines the current strengths and weaknesses of the field. The committee discusses how limnology can contribute to appropriate policies for industrial waste, wetlands destruction, the release of greenhouse gases, extensive damming of rivers, the zebra mussel and other "invasions" of species-- the broad spectrum of problems that threaten the nation's freshwater supply. Freshwater Ecosystems provides the foundation for improving a field whose importance will continue to increase as human populations grow and place even greater demands on freshwater resources. This volume will be of value to administrators of university and government science programs, faculty and students in aquatic science, aquatic resource managers, and clean-water advocates--and it is readily accessible to the concerned individual.

T1  - Science and the Endangered Species Act
AN  - 2131797319
AB  - The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is a far-reaching law that has sparked intense controversies over the use of public lands, the rights of property owners, and economic versus environmental benefits. 
In this volume a distinguished committee focuses on the science underlying the ESA and offers recommendations for making the act more effective. 
The committee provides an overview of what scientists know about extinction--and what this understanding means to implementation of the ESA. Habitat--its destruction, conservation, and fundamental importance to the ESA--is explored in detail. 
The book analyzes Concepts of species--how the term "species" arose and how it has been interpreted for purposes of the ESA. Conflicts between species when individual species are identified for protection, including several case studies. Assessment of extinction risk and decisions under the ESA--how these decisions can be made more effectively. The book concludes with a look beyond the Endangered Species Act and suggests additional means of biological conservation and ways to reduce conflicts. It will be useful to policymakers, regulators, scientists, natural-resource managers, industry and environmental organizations, and those interested in biological conservation.

AN  - 384980474
AB  - Just like the false stonework and fake cows, Lake Ontario's ecosystem  is contrived by humans. And beneath the lake's surface is a troubling  problem: Knocked off kilter by human interference and non-native species,  the lake's ecosystem is in an unpredictable cycle of peak and crash that  is almost impossible to manage or to steer back toward equilibrium.  "There's nothing natural about that lake.

T1  - Fish stocking now seen by many as a form of pollution Critics say practice displaces wild fish, creates infertile breeds and masks major loss of habitat: [Final Edition]
AN  - 437250615
AB  - Fish stocking, now under way across the province, is an unsustainable practice wreaking havoc with aquatic ecosystems and damaging nature's regenerative powers, according to an increasing number of fisheries experts.              ``There's a growing consensus that stocking is not the way to go,'' says Mart Gross, a University of Toronto biologist who recently released a study indicating salmon stocking programs could threaten the entire species. ``We can never duplicate nature, which is more complex than we can ever hope to understand,''              ``We're at the same place with stocking that we were with smoking 20 years ago: a dialogue has begun and a few steps to stop it,'' says Bernie May, a fish geneticist at Cornell University who has studied stocking across North America. ``Gradually people will realize things have to change.''

T1  - Minnesotas St. Croix River Valley and Anoka Sandplain:&nbsp;A Guide to Native Habitats
AN  - 2131255672
AB  - We tend to take the landscape around us for granted, believing that the land has looked, smelled, and sounded as it does now for as far back in time as we can imagine.—from the bookJust 150 years after the first Euro-American settlers moved into the region now known as the St. Croix River Valley and Anoka Sandplain, only small fragments of the native landscape remain. For example, only about 6 percent of the forests present 150 years ago are left, and a mere 1 percent of the prairies remain. Minnesota's St. Croix River Valley and Anoka Sandplain offers a fascinating landscape history of this six-county region in east-central Minnesota, including detailed descriptions of thirty-nine varieties of native habitats that still exist there. The region includes the counties of Anoka, Chisago, Isanti, Ramsey, Sherburne, and Washington.Much of the data presented in Minnesota's St. Croix River Valley and Anoka Sandplain was recently gathered by the Minnesota County Biological Survey, and is appearing in print for the first time. All of the data is summarized and interpreted to provide a convenient guide for anyone interested in the natural history of the region, including landowners seeking more information on a forest or prairie on their land, persons interested in visiting native habitats in the region, government planners and resource managers, and high school biology classes.For each native habitat, the authors include descriptive text, photographs, line drawings, distribution maps, and lists of associated plants and animals. The book also contains a guide providing directions to and interpretation of 35 sites accessible to the public where these native habitats can be explored. No other single book gives such a thorough and integrated treatment of the native habitats and landscape of the area. A set of companion color wall maps is also available (Minnesota's St. Croix River Valley and Anoka Sandplain: Maps of Native Habitats). These document the location of the remaining native habitats, along with rare plants and animals.

T1  - Mussel power taking over Great Lakes: [City Edition]
AN  - 275144382
AB  - OTTAWA - Canada must get tough with sea-going freighters or suffer "massive invasions" of foreign pests like the zebra mussel in the Great Lakes, the International Joint Commission says.                 Extremes of acidity or alkalinity also also deadly to the zebra mussel. Nevertheles, they can survive almost anywhere in a range that covers about two-thirds of the United States and the southern part of Canada.                 In addition to the tongue-like "feet" that mussels use to push themselves along the bottom, zebra mussels, alone among freshwater mussels, possess clumps of threads that allow the mussel to attach itself to hard surfaces, like rocks or steel, or other mussels.

T1  - Mussel invasion 'worse than oil spill' Potentially disastrous mollusks making their way toward Metro: [FIN Edition]
AN  - 436152906
AB  - The zebra mussels, which arrived here from Europe only a few years ago, are certainly established. They enter water pipes while still tiny, and then attach themselves to the insides of the pipes with their biological "threads" and stick like glue.                 Officials say Metro's four huge water intake pipes, between 6 and 11 feet (1.8 and 3.3 metres) in diameter, will probably survive any attack, because zebra mussels prefer pipes no wider than a foot.                 To this end, U.S. Senator [John Glenn]'s $40 million bill proposes three steps - helping American cities repair their damage from mussels, increasing research and making it against the law to dump ballast water that contains any foreign species.
