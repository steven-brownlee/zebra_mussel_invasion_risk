	abstract = {Sexual systems are highly diverse and have profound consequences for population dynamics and resilience. Yet, little is known about how they evolved. Using phylogenetic Bayesian modelling and a sample of 4614 species, we show that gonochorism is the likely ancestral condition in teleost fish. While all hermaphroditic forms revert quickly to gonochorism, protogyny and simultaneous hermaphroditism are evolutionarily more stable than protandry. In line with theoretical expectations, simultaneous hermaphroditism does not evolve directly from gonochorism but can evolve slowly from sequential hermaphroditism, particularly protandry. We find support for the predictions from life history theory that protogynous, but not protandrous, species live longer than gonochoristic species and invest the least in male gonad mass. The distribution of sexual systems of teleosts on the tree of life does not seem to reflect just adaptive predictions, suggesting that adaptations alone may not fully explain why some sexual forms evolve in some taxa but not others (Williams' paradox). We propose that future studies should incorporate mating systems, spawning behaviours, and the diversity of sex determining mechanisms. Some of the latter might constrain the evolution of hermaphroditism, while the non-duality of the embryological origin of teleost gonads might explain why protogyny predominates over protandry in teleosts.

Footnotes
* We have revised the assignment of the sexual system of all hermaphrodites and thus updated our dataset. We consider hermaphrodites only the species for which functional hermaphroditism has been proved in the primary literature. Details can be found in the Materials \& Methods section, and an overview of all the process of data acquisition and curation is presented the new Suppl. Fig. 1, which also indicates the source of the phylogenetic tree used. Mating systems and spawning behavior definitions have been improved and clarified. Some of the predictions of life history theory have been clarified and all the analyses are now corrected for allometry. Thus, - figures 2, 4 and 5 revised. - tables 2 and 3 revised. - new figure 3 uploaded. Most of the conclusions of our study hold although some results using this new dataset change slightly. Specifically, we still find that: i) both types of sequential hermaphroditism can evolve slowly from gonochorism and revert quickly to it; ii) protogyny is lost at low rate to protandry and simultaneous hermaphroditism; iii) protandry is not evolutionarily stable and is quickly lost to gonochorism, protogyny and, to a lesser degree, simultaneous hermaphroditism. However, we now find that simultaneous hermaphroditism does not evolve directly from gonochorism but via sequential hermaphroditism, most likely protandry, thus confirming theoretical predictions. In addition, simultaneous hermaphroditism is more likely to be lost to gonochorism than to either form of sequential hermaphroditism. Analyses on life history traits confirm that protogynous (but not protandrous) species live longer than gonochoristic and present the smallest GSI. With the new dataset we no longer find evidence that protandrous species are smaller and mature later than protogynous species.},

	abstract = {On his death, Arthur Boucot (1924-2017) left an unfinished manuscript in which he surveyed the skeletal, behavioural, and cultural changes that have characterized Homo from its first recognition in the Late Pliocene to the present. The subjects he treated were as varied as the preparation of food for infants, the length of intestines, hafting, plastering, use of flint and metals, the domestication of grains and animals, and the prevalence of parasitic diseases. His text repeatedly notes the difficulties imposed by the enormous gaps in both fossil and archaeological records. Boucot deduced a continuity in basic human behaviours from the Oldowan and Acheulian into modern forms, and made a point of including Neandertals and Denisovans. But he also pointed out that morphological changes in successive species of Homo do not coincide in time with major changes in lithic technologies. Boucot concluded that a quantum evolutionary gap separates hominins from the great apes: that members of our line were sapient and had been using language long before they became sapiens. In his text he also indicates his concern for changes to the environment wrought by human activities. The results of this late-life effort, edited after his death, provide a heavily referenced sourcebook for future workers in diverse fields.},

Plastic products contribute heavily to anthropogenic pollution of the oceans. Small plastic particles in the micro- and nanoscale ranges have been found in all marine ecosystems, but little is known about their effects upon marine organisms. In this study we examine changes in cell growth, aggregation, and gene expression of two symbiotic dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae, Symbiodinium tridacnidorum (clade A3) and Cladocopium sp. (clade C), under exposure to 42-nm polystyrene beads. In laboratory experiments, cell number and aggregation were reduced after 10 days of nanoplastic exposure at 0.01, 0.1, and 10 mg/L concentrations, but no clear correlation with plastic concentration was observed. Genes involved in dynein motor function were upregulated compared to control conditions, while genes related to photosynthesis, mitosis, and intracellular degradation were downregulated. Overall, nanoplastic exposure led to more genes being downregulated than upregulated and the number of genes with altered expression was larger in Cladocopium sp. than in S. tridacnidorum, suggesting different sensitivity to nanoplastic between species. Our data show that nanoplastic inhibits growth and alters aggregation properties of microalgae, which may negatively affect the uptake of these indispensable symbionts by coral reef organisms.

Laboratory and field tests show traces of oral contraceptives causing the feminisation of fish and amphibians, and residues of psychiatric drugs altering fish behaviour. Antimicrobial resistance, linked to the overuse of antibiotics, has rapidly escalated into a global health crisis. Unless adequate measures are taken to manage the risks, pharmaceutical residues will increasingly be released into the environment as ageing populations, advances in healthcare, and intensification of meat and fish production spur the demand for pharmaceuticals worldwide. The report outlines a collective, life?cycle approach to managing pharmaceuticals in the environment. A policy mix of source?directed, use?orientated and end?of?pipe measures, involving several policy sectors, can help to improve health and protect the environment.},

Wasser und Abfall 10/2012 Landschafts- und Klimawandel haben Auswirkungen auf alle Umweltmedien, Anpassungsmaßnahmen sind in allen Bereichen, insbesondere im Bereich Wasser, notwendig. Welche Auswirkungen aber haben diese wasserbezogenen Anpassungsmaßnahmen auf die Umwelt? Antworten auf diese Frage bietet das neu erschienene Buch „Wasserbezogene Anpassungsmaßnahmen an den Landschafts- und Klimwandel“. Im Mittelpunkt des Buches stehen praktische Beispiele. Die Autoren stellen die landschaftsbaulichen Maßnahmen im Braunkohleabbaugebiet der Lausitz vor und diskutieren den dort vorhandenen weiteren Handlungsbedarf aufgrund des Klimawandels. Notwendige und optionale Wassermanagement-Maßnahmen zeigen sie anhand des Rheins und der Elbe auf. Auch die Unterschiede zwischen wasserreichen Bundesländern wie Bayern und wasserarmen Ländern in Nordostdeutschland kommen zur Sprache. Aktuelle Beispiele für die technische, wirtschaftliche und infrastrukturelle Gestaltung des Wandels durch angepasste Verfahren runden das Buch ab. Korrespondenz Wasserwirtschaft 2012 (5) Nr. 11 29 Beiträge von einzelnen oder mehreren Autoren enthalten in 6 Kapiteln zusammenfassend die wichtigsten Ergebnisse eines Fachsymposium (22. bis 24.6.2011) in Großräschen in der im Umbruch befindlichen Bergbaufolgelandschaft der Niederlausitz. Die einzelnen Kapitelüberschriften lauten: - Einführung, - Landschaftswandel, globaler Wandel und regionale Anpassung: Perspektiven, - Landschaftswandel und wasserbezogene Anpassungsmaßnahmen am Beispiel der Region Lausitz, - Wasserbezogene Anpassungsmaßnahmen in Regionen und Flusseinzugsgebieten, - Ansätze und Instrumente zur gesellschaftlichen Steuerung wasserbezogener Anpassungsmaßnahmen, - Technische, wirtschaftliche und infrastrukturelle Gestaltung des Wandels. Die neuen Ansätze und Instrumente zur gesellschaftlichen Steuerung wasserbezogener Anpassungsmaßnahmen werden durch zahlreiche Beispiele für die technische, wirtschaftliche und infrastrukturelle Gestaltung des Wandels vervollständigt.

	abstract = {There is an urgent need to rethink relationships between systems of government and those who are 'governed'. This book explores ways of rethinking those relationships by bringing communities normally excluded from decision-making to centre stage to experiment with new methods of regulating for engagement. Using original, co-produced research, it innovatively shows how we can better use a 'bottom-up' approach to design regulatory regimes that recognise the capabilities of communities at the margins and powerfully support the knowledge, passions and creativity of citizens. The authors provide essential guidance for all those working on co-produced research to make impactful change.There is an urgent need to rethink the relationships between systems of government and those who are 'governed'. The contemporary transfer of state regulation to the market-based regulation of corporate interests has marginalised many communities in the regulatory systems of everyday life. Exploring a broad range of intersecting areas including immigration, social work, food regulation, space and surveillance, older people, ethnicity and faith, this book takes a 'bottom up' approach that brings to the fore the experiences and expertise of these communities in order to examine ways that we can better design regulatory systems that support the knowledge and creativity of citizens.},

	abstract = {This two-volume publication offers an in-depth analysis of ophidian symbolism in Eastern Africa, while setting the topic within its regional and historical context: namely, with regards to the rest of Africa, ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Greek world, ancient Palestine, Arabia, India, and medieval and pre-Christian Europe. Through the ages, most of those areas have connected with Eastern Africa in a broad sense, where ophidian symbolism was as "rampant" and far-reaching, if not more so, as anywhere else on the continent, and perhaps in past civilisations. Much as in the wider context, snakes were held to be long-lived, closely related to holes, caverns, trees, and water, life and death, and credited with a liking for milk. Even though ophidian symbolism has always been developed out of the outstanding biological and ethological features of snakes, the process of symbolisation, which plays a crucial role in the elaboration of cultural systems and the shaping of human experience, was inevitably at work. This first volume deals with snakes as a zoological category; snake symbolism as perceived by encyclopaedists and psychologists; and ophidian symbolism as it occurred in ancient civilisations. It explores the traditional African scene in general with a view to set the scene for a more proximate baseline for comparison. The divide between animals and humans was porous, and snakes had a more or less equal footing in both the animal realm and the spiritual world. Key features of snake symbolism in traditional Eastern Africa are then examined in detail, especially phantasmagorical snakes, the rainbow serpent, snake-totems, and snake-related witches and ritual leaders, among others. In Eastern Africa, the meanings attributed to snakes were multifaceted and paradoxical. Overall, the two volumes of this publication show that African snake symbolism broadly echoed the diverse representations of ancient civilisations. The widely acknowledged assimilation of snakes to death and Evil is therefore unrepresentative, both historically and culturally.},

"Relationships between humans and non-human animals are deeply complex and often governed by tensions and paradoxes. Both wild and domestic, metaphorical and real, assistants and adversaries, animals effortlessly bridge cultural and natural spaces and form an integral part of human lives. This volume addresses several currently debated topics in science and culture: How shall we rethink, rebuild and re-envision our relationships with other animals? How do we construct ideas of 'the animal'? How can we negotiate animal interests against our own? In which ways do we make sense - and use - of animals in 'human' cultural spaces? Addressing the non-human animal from the standpoint of various social and cultural constructions from a global and multidisciplinary perspective, the chapters within this volume do not seek to answer these questions, but rather to draw attention to the complexity of the underlying issues and the manifold dimensions of the animal-human bond."},

'A very readable history of an important group of Australian pioneers' - Graham Seal, author of the bestselling Great Australian Stories


For the early settlers who came from Britain's crowded cities and tiny villages, it must have been extraordinarily liberating to pack their belongings onto a bullock dray and head beyond the reach of meddlesome authorities to claim new land for themselves.

Settlers spread out across inland Australia constructing windmills and fences, dry-stone walls and storehouses, livestock yards and droving routes, the traces of which can still be seen today. The fortunate and indomitable succeeded, while countless others succumbed to drought and flood. Those who were successful became a class all their own: the scrub aristocrats.

Barry Stone has scoured through diaries, journals and newspapers, and sorted myth from legend. He tells the stories of pioneers whose vision and hard work built pastoral empires running thousands of head of stock, providing meat for a growing colony and wool for export, a rural juggernaut that would lay the foundations of a prosperous nation.},

These volumes teach readers to think beyond apoptosis and describes all of the known processes that cells can undergo which result in cell death
This two-volume set is the first comprehensive collection to cover all of the known processes that cells undergo when they die. It is also the only one of its kind to compare these processes. It seeks to enlighten those in the field and stimulate their thinking by looking at these pathways when their research system does not show classic signs of apoptotic pathway activation. In addition, it links activities like the molecular biology of one process to another (e.g. Necrosis to Apoptosis) and contrasts those that are closely related.
Volume 1 of
Apoptosis and Beyond: The Many Ways Cells Die begins with a general view of the cytoplasmic and nuclear features of apoptosis. It then goes on to offer chapters on targeting the cell death mechanism; microbial programmed cell death; autophagy; cell injury, adaptation, and necrosis; necroptosis; ferroptosis; anoikis; pyronecrosis; and more. Volume 2 covers subjects such as phenoptosis; pyroptosis; hematopoiesis and eryptosis; cyclophilin d-dependent necrosis; and the role of phospholipase in cell death.

Covers all the known processes that dying cells undergo
Provides extensive coverage of a topic not fully covered before
Offers chapters written by top researchers in the field
Provides activities that link and contrast processes to each other

Apoptosis and Beyond: The Many Ways Cells Die will appeal to students and researchers/clinicians in cell biology, molecular biology, oncology, and tumor biology.

	abstract = {Bacterial genomes evolve in complex ecosystems and are best understood in this natural context, but replicating such conditions in the lab is challenging. We used transposon sequencing to define the fitness consequences of gene disruption in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus grown in natural freshwater, compared to axenic growth in common laboratory media. Gene disruptions in amino acid and nucleotide sugar pathways and in metabolic substrate transport machinery impaired fitness in both lake water and defined minimal medium relative to complex peptone broth. Fitness in lake water was enhanced by insertions in genes required for flagellum biosynthesis and reduced by insertions in genes involved in biosynthesis of the holdfast surface adhesin. We further uncovered numerous hypothetical and uncharacterized genes for which disruption impaired fitness in lake water, defined minimal medium, or both. At the genome scale, the fitness profile of mutants cultivated in lake water was more similar to that in complex peptone broth than in defined minimal medium. Microfiltration of lake water did not significantly affect the terminal cell density or the fitness profile of the transposon mutant pool, suggesting that Caulobacter does not strongly interact with other microbes in this ecosystem on the measured timescale. Fitness of select mutants with defects in cell surface biosynthesis and environmental sensing were significantly more variable in lake water than in defined medium, presumably owing to day-to-day heterogeneity in the lake environment. This study reveals genetic interactions between Caulobacter and a natural freshwater environment, and provides a new avenue to study gene function in complex ecosystems.

	abstract = {Now in one convenient volume, Vocal Health and Pedagogy: Science, Assessment, and Treatment, Third Edition answers every question you've ever had about the voice, from the physics of sounds, to vocal technique, to medications, to performance anxiety. It presents anatomical, physiological, and neurological considerations, as well as covers critical issues related to patient history, laryngeal function, the physical examination, and historical perspectives of vocal pedagogy. The first part of the book introduces basic concepts of voice science, assessment, and training. It focuses on the science behind the common problems that afflict voice users and enables understanding of the medical approach to problem analysis. The second part of the book contains additional information on the specific health and performance conditions that affect the voice and their assessment and treatment. It considers the medical and nonmedical issues affecting the human voice, including diagnosis and treatment of voice problems, the effects of physical injury, posture, pollutants and irritants, psychological effects, voice therapy, medication, and more. New to this edition: New chapters on topics such as pedagogy for children, the importance of studying music, laryngeal issues involving wind instrument performance, high-speed digital imaging, the evolution of technology, pediatric voice disorders, thyroid disorders, the vocal effects of birth control medications, and autoimmune disorders. Many chapters have been extensively revised to update previous content and add new information on material such as choral pedagogy for geriatric singers, World Trade Center syndrome, and laryngeal effects of asbestos exposure. Chapters on medications for performers have been revised to delete medications no longer used frequently and to add various medications and drug classes that were not included previously, as well as information on alternative and complementary medicines. References have been updated throughout to include discussion of new studies and a review of the latest literature, while also retaining the classic literature. Includes the most recent practices and techniques, the latest information on surgical and adjunctive therapy, and important changes in criteria and strategy. Vocal Health and Pedagogy: Science, Assessment, and Treatment, Third Edition is ideal for courses in vocal pedagogy and speech-language pathology.

Neurobiology of Motor Control brings together contributions from an interdisciplinary group of experts to provide a review of the current state of knowledge about the initiation and execution of movement, as well as the latest methods and tools for investigating them.
The book ranges from the findings of basic scientists studying model organisms such as mollusks and
Drosophila, to biomedical researchers investigating vertebrate motor production to neuroengineers working to develop robotic and smart prostheses technologies. Following foundational chapters on current molecular biological techniques, neuronal ensemble recording, and computer simulation, it explores a broad range of related topics, including the evolution of motor systems, directed targeted movements, plasticity and learning, and robotics.

Explores motor control and movement in a wide variety of organisms, from simple invertebrates to human beings
Offers concise summaries of motor control systems across a variety of animals and movement types
Explores an array of tools and methodologies, including electrophysiological techniques, neurogenic and molecular techniques, large ensemble recordings, and computational methods
Considers unresolved questions and how current scientific advances may be used to solve them going forward

Written specifically to encourage interdisciplinary understanding and collaboration, and offering the most wide-ranging, timely, and comprehensive look at the science of motor control and movement currently available,
Neurobiology of Motor Control is a must-read for all who study movement production and the neurobiological basis of movement--from molecular biologists to roboticists.

Food Safety in China: Science, Technology, Management and Regulation presents a comprehensive overview of the history and current state of food safety in China, along with emerging regulatory trends and the likely future needs of the country. Although the focus is on China, global perspectives are presented in the chapters and 33 of the 99 authors are from outside China. Introductory chapters address such issues as the shared responsibility for food safety, the development of China's food industry, the current status of China's food safety, and educational and training courses designed to ensure food safety in China. The scientific aspects of food safety are explored next, with seven chapters on food microbiology, five on food chemistry and four chapters on risk assessment. A series of six chapters then addresses China's relatively new food laws and regulations, inspection methods and international trade. This is followed by a focus on six major commodity groups: meat, dairy, fruits and vegetables, fats and oils, cereals and seafood. Four concluding chapters discuss the application of innovative technologies to food safety.

Plant species, microorganisms and marine flora and fauna produce hundreds of toxic compounds for defence and to promote their chances of survival, and these can be isolated and appropriated for our own use. Many of these toxins have yet to be thoroughly described, despite being studied for years. Focusing on the natural toxins that are purely toxic to insects, this book contains over 500 chemical structures. It discusses the concepts and mechanisms involved in toxicity, bioassay procedures for evaluation, structure-activity relationships, and the potential for future commercialization of these compounds. A comprehensive review of the subject, this book forms an important source of information for researchers and students of crop protection, pest control, phytochemistry and those dealing in insect-plant interactions.},

	abstract = {"Brings novel, synthetic insight to understanding a region that was a hub of waterborne trade and an important locus of production for some of the Maya's most valued crops."--Cynthia Robin, author of Everyday Life Matters: Maya Farmers at Chan "This one of a kind volume shows us how important this region was to the ancient Maya with detailed and vivid descriptions of sociopolitical and economic organization and their relation to the unique landscape and geography of Chetumal Bay."--Laura J. Kosakowsky, author of Preclassic Maya Pottery at Cuello, Belize Chetumal Bay is central to discussions of ancient Maya politics, warfare, economy, exchange and communication because of its unique location. Although the ancient Maya invested prodigious amounts of labor in the construction of road systems called sacbeob for communication and trade, recent archaeological discoveries around Chetumal Bay in both Belize and Mexico reveal an economic alternative to these roads: an extensive network of riverine and maritime waterways. Focusing on sites ringing the bay such as Cerro Maya, Oxtankah, and Santa Rita Corozal, the contributors to this volume explore how the bay and its feeder rivers affected all aspects of Maya culture from settlement, food production, and the production and use of special goods to political relationships and social organization. Besides being a nexus for long distance exchange in valuable materials such as jade and obsidian, the region was recognized for its high quality agricultural produce, including cacao, achiote, vanilla, local fruits, honey, and salt, and for its rich marine environment. The Maya living on the fringes of the bay perceived the entire region as a single resource procurement zone. Waterborne trade brought the world to them, providing a wider horizon than would have been available to inland cities dependent only on Maya roads for news of the world. The research reveals that trade relations played a central role in the organization of human social life on Chetumal Bay.

Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) speciation is an important area of nutrient research, both in terms of biodegradability in wastewater treatment and bioavailability in the water environment. Water quality modeling may not be reflecting all that is known about point source effluent N and P from treatment facilities that reduce the total amount of nutrients discharged and also change N and P speciation and reduce bioavailability. WERF research into advanced levels of nutrient removal treatment is revealing new information about N and P speciation and reduced bioavailability of the N and P remaining after advanced treatment.Many of the more sophisticated mechanistic water quality models have the ability to simulate N and P species, and to some degree reflect refractory organic nutrient inputs and their subsequent degradation. Selecting water quality models with the capability of simulating nutrient species, and gathering monitoring data to characterize nutrient species and refractory compounds, is important to support enhancements in modeling.},

	abstract = {Chromatin Signaling and Diseases covers the molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression, which govern everything from embryonic development, growth, and human pathologies associated with aging, such as cancer. This book helps researchers learn about or keep up with the quickly expanding field of chromatin signaling. After reading this book, clinicians will be more capable of explaining the mechanisms of gene expression regulation to their patients to reassure them about new drug developments that target chromatin signaling mechanisms. For example, several epigenetic drugs that act on chromatin signaling factors are in clinical trials or even approved for usage in cancer treatments, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases. Other epigenetic drugs are in development to regulate various class of chromatin signaling factors. To keep up with this changing landscape, clinicians and doctors will need to stay familiar with genetic advances that translate to clinical practice, such as chromatin signaling. Although sequencing of the human genome was completed over a decade ago and its structure investigated for nearly half a century, molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression remain largely misunderstood. An emerging concept called chromatin signaling proposes that small protein domains recognize chemical modifications on the genome scaffolding histone proteins, facilitating the nucleation of enzymatic complexes at specific loci that then open up or shut down the access to genetic information, thereby regulating gene expression. The addition and removal of chemical modifications on histones, as well as the proteins that specifically recognize these, is reviewed in Chromatin Signaling and Diseases. Finally, the impact of gene expression defects associated with malfunctioning chromatin signaling is also explored. Explains molecular mechanisms that regulate gene expression, which governs everything from embryonic development, growth, and human pathologies associated with aging Educates clinicians and researchers about chromatin signaling, a molecular mechanism that is changing our understanding of human pathology Explores the addition and removal of chemical modifications on histones, the proteins that specifically recognize these, and the impact of gene expression defects associated with malfunctioning chromatin signaling Helps researchers learn about the quickly expanding field of chromatin signaling},

	abstract = {Maintaining ideal fish health and production, both of farmed and wild fish populations, requires continuous infrastructural and process upgrades to avoid significant losses as well as to facilitate seafood safety. Aquaculture is multidisciplinary in nature, combining knowledge from biology, veterinary medicine and food technology. Practical Notions on Fish Health and Production brings an integrated approach concerning practical aspects of ichthyology, fish health and aquaculture systems. The textbook will give readers a better understanding of issues related to the management of fish health and production, seafood processing, security, quality and safety. The book is organized in three sections which cover 1) general aspects of fish biology and development, 2) fish diseases and veterinary medicine, and 3) aquaculture and marine food supply chain management. Practical Notions on Fish Health and Production is an essential text for students, food industry professionals and novice fish farmers undertaking courses or training programs in veterinary medicine, aquaculture, and marine food processing systems.},

	abstract = {Florida has an amazing biohistory. Its fossil record reveals that 8-ton ground sloths, giant beavers, and tiny horses once roamed its 66,000 square miles. Its human history is the story of people who arrived some 12,000 years ago after a journey that took them from Asia across the Bering land bridge and then south across the North American continent. Today, Florida is home to historic St. Augustine, the futuristic Kennedy Space Center, and the mysterious Everglades. Hosting a diverse ecology and a rich human history, Florida now faces a tenuous future as its natural resources are depleted, new species of plants, animals and diseases invade, and climate changes loom. This fascinating biohistory, prehistoric to present-day, and with an eye to the future, is told with verve and clarity. The result is a fascinating story of how they all interrelate.},

	abstract = {In the hard sciences, which can often feel out of grasp for many lay readers, there are "great thinkers" who go far beyond the equations, formulas, and research. Minds such as Stephen Hawking philosophize about the functions and nature of the universe, the implications of our existence, and other impossibly fascinating, yet difficult questions. Stuart A. Kauffman is one of those great thinkers. He has dedicated his lifetime to researching "complex systems" at prestigious institutions and now writes his treatise on the most complex system of all: our universe.A recent Scientific American article claims that "philosophy begins where physics ends, and physics begins where philosophy ends," and perhaps no better quote sums up what Kauffman's latest book offers. Grounded in his rigorous training and research background, Kauffman is inter-disciplinary in every sense of the word, sorting through the major questions and theories in biology, physics, and philosophy. Best known for his philosophy of evolutionary biology, Kauffman coined the term "prestatability" to call into question whether science can ever accurately and precisely predict the future development of biological features in organisms. As evidenced by the title's mention of creativity, the book refreshingly argues that our preoccupation to explain all things with scientific law has deadened our creative natures. In this fascinating read, Kauffman concludes that the development of life on earth is not entirely predictable, because no theory could ever fully account for the limitless variations of evolution. Sure to cause a stir, this book will be discussed for years to come and may even set the tone for the next "great thinker."},

His research interests lie in the formulation of an integrative developmental theory that can account for both normal and abnormal forms of ontogenesis. His work has several foci: 1) developmental psychopathology; 2) the developmental consequences of child maltreatment; 3) neural plasticity and sensitive periods; 4) the impact of traumatic experiences upon brain development; 5) the biology and psychology of unipolar and bipolar depressive diseases; 6) the interrelationships among molecular genetic, neurobiological, socio-emotional, cognitive, linguistic and representational development in normal and pathological populations; and 7) the study of attachment relations and representational models of the self and its disorders across the life span. Cicchetti has published hundreds of articles, books, and journals that have had far-reaching impact on developmental theory as well as science, policy, and practice related to child maltreatment, depression, mental retardation, and numerous other domains of development.},

Part one introduces the field of embodied language processing, before part two presents recent developments in our understanding of embodied conceptual understanding. The final two parts look at the applied nature of embodied cognition, exploring the embodied nature of social co-ordination as well as the emerging field of artificial embodiment. Building on the idea that knowledge acquisition, retention and retrieval are intimately interconnected with sensory and motor processes, Foundations of Embodied Cognition is a landmark publication in the field. It will be of great interest to researchers and advanced students from across the cognitive sciences, including those specialising in psychology, neuroscience, intelligent systems and robotics, philosophy, linguistics and anthropology.},

The topics covered in this new handbook pertain to issues such as love and marriage, belief in God, hell, and the devil, education, lordship and servitude, Christianity versus Judaism and Islam, health, medicine, the rural world, the rise of the urban class, travel, roads and bridges, entertainment, games, and sport activities, numbers, measuring, the education system, the papacy, saints, the senses, death, and money.
A follow-up publication to the Handbook of Medieval Studies, this new reference work turns to a different focus: medieval culture.

	abstract = {Science, Technology, and New Challenges to Ocean Law offers fresh perspectives on a set of vital issues in the field of ocean law and policy. Since the early period of the industrial revolution, successive waves of revolutionary scientific discoveries and technological innovations have intensified the global population's exploitation of ocean and coastal resources. In this volume, several leading authorities in the field address major dimensions of the interface of science, technology and ocean law--both historically and in current-day perspective--and emergent challenges in legal ordering of ocean uses for sustainability and equitability. Among the topics that are analysed in these readable, accessible papers are ecosystem approaches to resource management, the historic interplay of science and military concerns, the place of science in dispute-settlement processes, the varied human uses of the seabed, the roles in ocean governance of indigenous peoples, legal issues in fisheries management and conservation, and special regional problems of the Arctic, the Bering Strait, the South China Sea, and the eastern Mediterranean. The urgent importance of the subjects addressed here, together with the variety of disciplinary approaches deployed by the authors, enhance the value of this book's unique contribution to the literature of ocean studies.},

Despite an increasing trend toward the use of phytotherapies for chemoprevention and management of disease in healthcare, the published work about their efficacy and safety is scattered - and scientists need to understand these key issues along with regulatory aspects of phytotherpeutic agents. A number of herbs are likely to cause adverse effects if not properly standardized in clinical trials. 
Covering fundamentals and new developments in phytotherapy, this book combines pharmaceutical sciences and chemistry - including herbal medicine clinical trials, specific applications of phytomedicine, successful case studies, and international regulatory perspectives that are essential for research and development of phytotherapeutics.
The book discusses a wide range of topics and focuses on the clinical aspect of phytotherapeutic agents. It describes the major groups of phytotherapeutics, scientific and pharmacological basis for efficacy, active components and ingredients, the metabolism and interactions of these drugs, and future perspectives on phytotherapeutics. In addition, chapters deal with international regulatory aspects and crucial topics for proper clinical trials - analytical challenges for quality control, examples of clinical trials, and drug delivery and formulation issues. Specific types of regional phytomedicines feature alongside those used for different applications like cellular drug targets or chemoprevention. Chapters also deal with phytotherapies for major diseases like cancer, liver disorders, inflammation, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.
In offering such a thorough collection of information on phytotherapies, this unique book helps practicing scientists and medical and pharmaceutical science researchers understand the fundamentals and most effective application of phytotherapeutic agents.

	abstract = {Chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel diseases, and others typically stimulate a systemic response of the entire body. This response has a uniform character in many diseases because common pathways are switched on. The uniform response regulates systemic energy and water provision. However, long-term application of this program leads to typical disease sequelae such as fatigue / depressive symptoms, sleep disturbances, anorexia, malnutrition, muscle wasting cachexia, cachectic obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, alterations of steroid hormone axes, disturbances of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, elevated sympathetic tone, hypertension, volume expansion, decreased parasympathetic tone, inflammation related anemia, bone loss, hypercoagulability, circadian rhythms of symptoms, and disease exacerbation by stress ." " "The Origin of Chronic Inflammatory Systemic Diseases" "and Their Sequelae "demonstrates concepts of neuroendocrine immunology, energy and water regulation, and evolutionary medicine in order to show that the uniform response that regulates systemic energy and water provision, has been positively selected for acute physiological responses and short-lived disease states, but is a misguided program in chronic inflammatory diseases and aging. * Offers a broad conceptual framework with a strong clinical link, written in an easy to grasp style and demonstrating the link to aging research * Describes the important principles derived from basic immunology that are used to explain pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory systemic diseases with a focus on autoimmunity * Defines the bioenergetics and energy regulation of the body explaining common response pathways typical for systemic inflammation * Makes use of evolutionary medicine theory to demonstrate the uniformity of the systemic response * Explains the appearance of typical disease sequelae on the basis of the three pillars: neuroendocrine immunology, energy regulation, and evolutionary medicine theory * Contains color figures and tables that explain the field to newcomers"},

Ben Beattie is a fishing guide and outdoor writer living in Sioux Lookout, in northwestern Ontario's Sunset Country.

His love of fishing and hunting brought him to Sioux Lookout, where he has guided for the last 12 years.              Muskie is his No. 1 passion, and he works hard to make sure these trophy fish are released properly, through correct handling and with minimal stress. Beattie says hanging them vertically without support is not acceptable anymore, especially when using a scale or jaw grabber. Large pike and muskie are extremely susceptible to delayed mortality when handled this way.              We then decided to move east towards the main island and shallower water. I knew we were on the right track when longtime guide Lee Nolden stopped by to chat. There probably isn't anybody who sport fishes Lake Winnipeg that knows more about the fishery than Lee.},

The absence of an anti-Leishmania vaccine, the toxicity of current anti-parasite drugs, coupled with the rapid emergence of drug resistant Leishmania strains remain significant challenges for disease control. This has spurred a plethora of research initiatives into the parasite biology, parasite-host interaction, mechanisms of disease pathogenesis, drug development and molecular mechanism of drug resistance. Insights obtained from various such studies are essential for the development of novel anti-Leishmania treatment strategies. In this timely book respected Leismania experts distil the important current research highlighting the most insightful discoveries in the field. Topics covered include: modulation of host miRNA; heat shock proteins; Iron in the Leishmania-macrophage interaction; oxidative and nitrosative stress response; cell death; strategies for immune evasion; STAT signalling; parasite modulation of toll-like receptors in macrophages; T cells in Leishmania infection; vaccine biology; inhibitors of Leishmania DNA topoisomerases; and mechanism of drug resistance in visceral Leishmaniasis.

	abstract = {Rosenberg's Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurologic and Psychiatric Disease, Fifth Edition provides a comprehensive introduction and reference to the foundations and key practical aspects relevant to the majority of neurologic and psychiatric disease. A favorite of over three generations of students, clinicians and scholars, this new edition retains and expands the informative, concise and critical tone of the first edition. This is an essential reference for general medical practitioners, neurologists, psychiatrists, geneticists, and related professionals, and for the neuroscience and neurology research community. The content covers all aspects essential to the practice of neurogenetics to inform clinical diagnosis, treatment and genetic counseling. Every chapter has been thoroughly revised or newly commissioned to reflect the latest scientific and medical advances by an international team of leading scientists and clinicians. The contents have been expanded to include disorders for which a genetic basis has been recently identified, together with abundant original illustrations that convey and clarify the key points of the text in an attractive, didactic format. 
Previous editions have established this book as the leading tutorial reference on neurogenetics. Researchers will find great value in the coverage of genomics, animal models and diagnostic methods along with a better understanding of the clinical implications. Clinicians will rely on the coverage of the basic science of neurogenetics and the methods for evaluating patients with biochemical abnormalities or gene mutations, including links to genetic testing for specific diseases.

	abstract = {Really hasn't seen much change since I started down this path back in 1986. The responsibilities of landowners are, in my opinion, nigh impossible to achieve. I'll paraphrase the Act, Section 5, which outlines the duty of an individual for pests and nuisances: "An owner or occupant of land or property shall take active measures to prevent the establishment of pests, control or destroy all pests on their property (not just land) and destroy any crop that contributes or may contribute to the maintenance or spread of a pest."


last year about our blackleg findings, the response from many was, 'So what? I still pulled off a 50 bu/ac crop. So finding blackleg is not a big deal, right?' In my opinion, we are courting disaster, big time, with our shortened rotations. Certainly, right now, blackleg doesn't appear to be hurting yields much if at all.


blackleg has a fantastic ability to cross and create new strains. It has the potential to morph from a virulent blackleg that is kept in check by our resistant varieties, to one which overcomes resistance, putting us back to the late 80's when blackleg nearly wiped out our canola industry, and everyone wore leg warmers. Canola growers are getting a wakeup call in the clubroot hot spots of the province, where clubroot resistance has broken down in some fields.},

	abstract = {Battarbee and Namatjira is the double biography of artists Rex Battarbee and Albert Namatjira, one white Australian from Warrnambool in Victoria, the other Aboriginal, of the Arrernte people, from the Hermannsburg Mission west of Alice Springs. From their first encounters in the early 1930s, when Battarbee introduced Namatjira to the techniques of watercolour painting, through the period of Namatjira’s extraordinary popularity as a painter, to his tragic death in 1959, their close relationship was to have a decisive impact on Australian art. This double biography makes extensive use of Battarbee’s diaries for the first time, to throw new light on Namatjira’s life, and to bring Battarbee, who has been largely ignored by biographers, back into focus. Moving between the artists and their backgrounds, Edmond portrays the personal and social difficulties the two men faced, while at the same time illuminating large cultural themes - the traditions and legacies of the Arrernte, the influence of the Lutheran church, the development of anthropology and the evolution of Australian art. A book full of startling insights. Might colour be the foundation of Arrernte philosophy? Might we understand each other, Arrernte style, in the same way we understand a colour - as a vividness that registers and enriches only in relation to the colours glowing nearby? For this seems to be the way these two vivid men - Battarbee and Namatjira - cast their peculiar hues. Each a catalyst and a primer for the other, each shimmering alongside the other. Ross Gibson Critical responses to Martin Edmond’s writing: ‘Luca Antara is a book-lover’s book, a graceful and mesmerising blend of history, autobiography, travel and romance.’ JM Coetzee ‘He is constantly demonstrating that the natural world is as splendiferous as any fable.

	abstract = {Wrestling with Words and Meanings honors the life and career of Professor Keith Allan, commemorating at the same time the occasion of his 70th birthday. The book brings together top-level researchers in linguistics - colleagues, collaborators, and former students - who have all been inspired by Allan's work in some way. These appropriately eclectic contributions are organized into the three main themes that run through Allan's multifaceted and multifarious research: word meaning, pragmatics and discourse, and semantic theory and philosophy of language. The festschrift offers glimpses into corpus linguistics, cognitive linguistics, and cultural linguistics, as well as the more traditional descriptive, diachronic, and typological perspectives. It is an outstanding collection in honor of an outstanding researcher. (Series: Linguistics)},

	abstract = {While most works of southeastern archaeology focus on stone artifacts or ceramics, this volume is the first to bring together past and current trends in zooarchaeological studies. Faunal reports are often relegated to appendices and not synthesized with the rest of the archaeological data, but 
Trends and Traditions in Southeastern Zooarchaeology calls attention to the diversity of information that faunal remains can reveal about rituals, ideologies, socio-economic organization, trade, and past environments.
These essays, by leading practitioners in this developing field, highlight the differences between the archaeological focus on animals as the food source of their time and the belief among zooarchaeologists that animals represent a far more complex ecology. With broad methodological and interpretive analysis of sites throughout the region, the essays range in topic from the enduring symbolism of shells for more than 5,000 years to the domesticated dog cemeteries of Spirit Hill in Jackson County, Alabama, and to the subsistence strategies of Confederate soldiers at the Florence Stockade in South Carolina.
Ultimately challenging traditional concepts of the roles animals have played in the social and economic development of southeastern cultures, this book is a groundbreaking and seminal archaeological study.},

	abstract = {The personal story and philosophy of one of the world's most famous urban architects is vividly presented in words and pictures. Discover the life, architecture, and philosophy of Eberhard Heinrich Zeidler, starting with his early life, his studies at the Bauhaus, and his reasons for leaving Germany. In his early days in Peterborough, Ontario, he became a partner of Blackwell and Craig and created homes, schools, hospitals, and the Peterborough Memorial Centre. After moving to Toronto, Zeidler designed the McMaster Health Sciences Centre, which started a new direction in healthcare buildings and attracted thousands of visiting architects. Many hospitals of this type followed, and architects all over the world appropriated Zeidler's philosophy. His design of the Eaton Centre succeeded in stimulating Toronto's dying downtown, bringing new life to it. Zeidler married Jane Abbott, lived on a farm, and had three children, two girls and one boy. A third daughter was born, and he renovated an old house in one of Toronto's ravines to raise his family. Projects all over the world followed, including ones in England, Germany, Calgary, Vancouver, Victoria, West Palm Beach, Beijing, Shanghai, and Dubai.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of the neurobiological basis of psychiatric disease has accelerated in the past five years. The fourth edition of Neurobiology of Mental Illness has been completely revamped given these advances and discoveries on the neurobiologic foundations of psychiatry. Like its predecessors the book begins with an overview of the basic science. The emerging technologies in Section 2 have been extensively redone to match the progress in the field including new chapters on the applications of stem cells, optogenetics, and image guided stimulation to our understanding and treatment of psychiatric disorders. Sections' 3 through 8 pertain to the major psychiatric syndromes-the psychoses, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, dementias, and disorders of childhood-onset. Each of these sections includes our knowledge of their etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment. The final section discusses special topic areas including the neurobiology of sleep, resilience, social attachment, aggression, personality disorders and eating disorders. In all, there are 32 new chapters in this volume including unique insights on DSM-5, the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) from NIMH, and a perspective on the continuing challenges of diagnosis given what we know of the brain and the mechanisms pertaining to mental illness. This book provides information from numerous levels of analysis including molecular biology and genetics, cellular physiology, neuroanatomy, neuropharmacology, epidemiology, and behavior. In doing so it translates information from the basic laboratory to the clinical laboratory and finally to clinical treatment. No other book distills the basic science and underpinnings of mental disorders and explains the clinical significance to the scope and breadth of this classic text. The result is an excellent and cutting-edge resource for psychiatric residents, psychiatric researchers, doctoral students, and postdoctoral fellows the neurosciences.},

	abstract = {Health risks are real and ever-changing, especially while traveling abroad. To stay abreast of the most up-to-date health recommendations, experienced travelers and health care professionals have always relied on CDC's user-friendly Health Information for International Travel (commonly known as the The Yellow Book) as their one indispensable guide. Updated biennially by a team of almost two hundred experts-including both CDC staff and travel medicine experts--this book is the only publication that contains all of the official government recommendations for international travel. Clearly written and featuring full-color illustrations, the book provides easy-to-read disease risk maps, information on where to find health care during travel, advice for those traveling with infants and children, a comprehensive catalog of diseases, and detailed country-specific health warnings. For example, the section on the Caribbean lays out the recommended immunizations and examines specific health risks for travelers to the region, ranging from malaria to dengue, yellow fever, and traveler's diarrhea. But the book goes beyond the risk of disease to discuss dangers such as violent crime-fortunately, not a great danger to tourists in the area-and also to remind travelers that the single greatest cause of injury death among visitors are traffic accidents. The section on the Caribbean also notes hurricane season and outlines the risks involved in snorkeling, diving, and other water activities common to the area. Every facet of the previous edition has been revisited and revised where necessary, including country-by-country immunization suggestions and new drug information. For the primary care clinician, the specialized travel medicine clinician, or the avid or first-time international traveler, this book is an indispensable safety net, providing readers with everything they need to know to prevent or to seek treatment for illness abroad.},

The nervous tissue functions because of the coherent and concerted action of many different cell types, each contributing to an ultimate output. This reaches its zenith in humans, with the creation of thoughts, underlying acquisition of knowledge, its analysis and synthesis, and contemplating the Universe and our place in it.


An up-to-date and fully referenced text on the most numerous cells in the human brain
Detailed coverage of the morphology and interrelationships between glial cells and neurones in different parts of the nervous system
Describes the role og glial cells in neuropathology

	abstract = {Examines methanol toxicity in humans, animals, and the environment 
Methanol is a natural product widely used as a chemical intermediate and as a component in a broad range of consumer products. It can also be highly toxic. This book offers a comprehensive review of the toxicity of methanol and its effects on humans, animals, and the environment. Much of the current research on methanol's toxicity involves animal models; however, the author explains how the results of this research can apply to humans.

The Toxicology of Methanol begins with an introduction to methanol production and markets. It then explores the impact of methanol on the environment, presenting realistic scenarios that demonstrate what can happen when large quantities of methanol are accidentally released into the environment. Next, the book covers:

Human toxicity, including exposure, metabolism, in utero exposure, controlled human studies, and management of methanol poisoning
Animal and aquatic toxicity, including acute toxicity, irritation, sensitization, and repeat exposures
Developmental and reproductive toxicology of methanol as well as the pathogenesis of methanol-induced birth defects
Key differences between PBPK models of methanol disposition in mice and in humans
Oxidative stress and species differences in the metabolism, developmental toxicity, and carcinogenic potential of methanol and ethanol
The final chapter is dedicated to methanol and cancer, exploring potential mechanisms such as genotoxicity and oxidative damage. Each chapter in the book ends with conclusions underscoring what we can glean from current research results. Each chapter also includes extensive references leading to the primary literature in the field.
Reviewing all the latest research studies,
The Toxicology of Methanol will help toxicologists, industrial hygienists, environmental scientists, and product safety professionals better understand and manage the hazards of methanol toxicity.

The Board's activities have corresponded with increased policy recognition of the importance of knowledge and technology to economic growth. The goal of the this symposium was to conduct two public symposia to review and analyze the potential contributions of public-private partnerships and identify other relevant issues for the Department of Energy, Office of Vehicle Technologies, Energy Storage Team's activities in the energy storage research and development area. The symposia will also identify lessons from these and other domestic and international experiences to help inform DoE as to whether its activities are complete and appropriately focused. Additional topics that emerge in the course of the planning may also be addressed. Building the U.S. Battery Industry for Electric Drive Vehicles: Summary of a Symposium gathers representatives from leading battery manufacturers, automotive firms, university researchers, academic and industry analysts, congressional staff, and federal agency representatives. An individually-authored summary of each symposium will be issued. 
The symposium was held in Michigan in order to provide direct access to the policymakers and industrial participants drawn from the concentration of battery manufacturers and automotive firms in the region. The symposium reviewed the current state, needs, and challenges of the U.S. advanced battery manufacturing industry; challenges and opportunities in battery R\&D, commercialization, and deployment; collaborations between the automotive industry and battery industry; workforce issues, and supply chain development. It also focused on the impact of DoE's investments and the role of state and federal programs in support of this growing industry. This task of this report is to summarize the presentations and discussions that took place at this symposium. Needless to say, the battery industry has evolved very substantially since the conference was held, and indeed some of the caveats raised by the speakers with regard to overall demand for batteries and the prospects of multiple producers now seem prescient. At the same time, it is important to understand that it is unrealistic to expect that all recipients of local, state, or federal support in a complex and rapidly evolving industry will necessarily succeed. A number of the firms discussed here have been absorbed by competitors, others have gone out of business, and others continue to progress.

	abstract = {This is a true story of discovery and discoverers in what was the northern frontier region of Mexico in the years before the Mexican War. In 1826, when the story begins, the region was claimed by both Mexico and the United States. Neither country knew much about the lands crossed by such rivers as the Guadalupe, Brazos, Nueces, Trinity, and Rio Grande. Jean Louis Berlandier, a French naturalist, was part of a team sent out by the Mexican Boundary Commission to explore the area. His role was to collect specimens of flora and fauna and to record detailed observations of the landscapes and peoples through which the exploring party traveled. His observations, including sketches and paintings of plants, landmarks, and American Indians, were the first compendium of scientific observations of the region to be collected and eventually published. Here, historian Russell Lawson tells the story of this multinational expedition, using Berlandier's copious records as a way of conveying his view of the natural environment. Lawson's narrative allows us to peer over Berlandier's shoulder as he traveled and recorded his experiences.

	abstract = {An argument that the way we listen to speech is shaped by our experience with our native language. 
Understanding speech in our native tongue seems natural and effortless; listening to speech in a nonnative language is a different experience. In this book, Anne Cutler argues that listening to speech is a process of native listening because so much of it is exquisitely tailored to the requirements of the native language. Her cross-linguistic study (drawing on experimental work in languages that range from English and Dutch to Chinese and Japanese) documents what is universal and what is language specific in the way we listen to spoken language.
Cutler describes the formidable range of mental tasks we carry out, all at once, with astonishing speed and accuracy, when we listen. These include evaluating probabilities arising from the structure of the native vocabulary, tracking information to locate the boundaries between words, paying attention to the way the words are pronounced, and assessing not only the sounds of speech but prosodic information that spans sequences of sounds. She describes infant speech perception, the consequences of language-specific specialization for listening to other languages, the flexibility and adaptability of listening (to our native languages), and how language-specificity and universality fit together in our language processing system.
Drawing on her four decades of work as a psycholinguist, Cutler documents the recent growth in our knowledge about how spoken-word recognition works and the role of language structure in this process. Her book is a significant contribution to a vibrant and rapidly developing field.},

Vasile I. Parvulescu received his master's degree in Catalysis from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest in 1979 and in 1986 gained his PhD in Chemistry from the same university, where he investigated the selectivity of bi- and multimetal catalysts in hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons. After several years as high-senior researcher at the Institute of Inorganic Chemistry and Rare Metals, in 1992 he joined the University of Bucharest, where he became full professor in 1999. His current interest concerns the study of heterogeneous catalysts for green and fine chemistry and environmental protection. He authored more than 230 papers, 25 patents, and 4 books. He was awarded in 1990 with the prize of the Romanian Academy and in 2008 Proclaimed Knight of the National Order for Merit by the Romanian President.

	abstract = {Action Analysis is one of the fundamental princples of animation that underpins all types of animation: 2d, 3d, computer animation, stop motion, etc. This is a fundamental skill that all animators need to create polished, believable animation. An example of Action Analysis would be Shrek's swagger in the film, Shrek. The animators clearly understood (through action analysis) the type of walk achieved by a large and heavy individual (the real) and then applied their observations to the animated character of an ogre (the fantastic). It is action analysis that enabled the animation team to visually translate a real life situation into an ogre's walk, achieving such fantastic results. Key animation skills are demonstrated with in-depth illustrations, photographs and live action footage filmed with high speed cameras. Detailed Case Studies, practical assignments and industry interviews ground action analysis methodology with real life examples. Action Analysis for Animators is a essential guide for students, amateurs and professionals.},

	abstract = {Transnational crimes involve border crossings as an integral part of the criminal activity. They also include crimes that take place in one country with consequences that significantly affect other countries. Examples include human trafficking, smuggling (arms, drugs, currency), sex slavery, non-domestic terrorism, and financial crimes. Transnational organized crime refers specifically to transnational crime carried out by organized crime syndicates. Although several encyclopedias cover aspects of transnational crime, it is this encyclopedia's emphasis on transnational justice, as well, that differentiates it from the pack. Not only do we define, describe, and chart the crimes and criminal activity, we also will include significant coverage of policing those crimes and prosecuting them within domestic and international court systems. Accessible and jargon-free and available in both print and electronic formats, the one-volume Encyclopedia of Transnational Crime and Justice will contain such entries as arms smuggling, art fraud, charity fraud, hacking and computer viruses, copyright infringement, counterfeiting, drug smuggling, extradition, human trafficking, intelligence agencies, international banking laws, Internet scams, Interpol, money laundering, pollution and waste disposal, price fixing, prosecution, sanctions, sex slavery, tax evasion, terrorism, war crimes, the World Court, and more. Features \& Benefits: 150 signed entries (each with Cross References and Further Readings) are organized in A-to-Z fashion to give students easy access to the full range of topics in transnational crime and justice. A thematic Reader's Guide in the front matter groups entries by broad topical or thematic areas to make it easy for users to find related entries at a glance. In the electronic version, the Reader's Guide combines with a detailed Index and the Cross References to provide users with convenient search-and-browse capacities. A Chronology in the back matter helps students put individual events into broader historical context. A Glossary provides students with concise definitions of key terms in the field. A Resource Guide to classic books, journals, and web sites (along with the Further Readings accompanying each entry) helps guide students to further resources in their research journeys. An Appendix includes the Congressional Research Service Report on International Terrorism and Transnational Crime.},

Trust and cooperation are the first problems we had to solve before we could become a social species. In the 21st century, they have become the most important problems we need to solve--again. Our global society has become so large and complex that our traditional trust mechanisms no longer work.
Bruce Schneier, world-renowned for his level-headed thinking on security and technology, tackles this complex subject head-on. Society can't function without trust, and yet must function even when people are untrustworthy.

Liars and Outliers reaches across academic disciplines to develop an understanding of trust, cooperation, and social stability. From the subtle social cues we use to recognize trustworthy people to the laws that punish the noncompliant, from the way our brains reward our honesty to the bank vaults that keep out the dishonest, keeping people cooperative is a delicate balance of rewards and punishments. It's a series of evolutionary tricks, social pressures, legal mechanisms, and physical barriers.
In the absence of personal relationships, we have no choice but to substitute security for trust, compliance for trustworthiness. This progression has enabled society to scale to unprecedented complexity, but has also permitted massive global failures.
At the same time, too much cooperation is bad. Without some level of rule-breaking, innovation and social progress become impossible. Society stagnates.

	abstract = {Neuroendocrinology, the discipline concerned with how the nervous system controls hormonal secretion and how hormones control the brain, is pivotal to physiology and medicine. Neuroendocrinology has disclosed and underpins fundamental physiological, molecular biological and genetic principles such as the regulation of gene transcription and translation, the mechanisms of chemical neurotransmission and intracellular and systemic feedback control systems. Reproduction, growth, stress, aggression, metabolism, birth, feeding and drinking and blood pressure are some of the bodily functions that are triggered and/or controlled by neuroendocrine systems. In turn, neuroendocrine dysfunction due to genetic or other deficits can lead, for example, to infertility, impotence, precocious or delayed puberty, defective or excessive growth, obesity and anorexia, Cushing's Syndrome, hypertension or thyroid disorders. These as well as neuroendocrine tumors are some of the themes covered in the 36 chapters of the Handbook. Drafted by internationally acknowledged experts in the field, the Handbook chapters feature detailed up-to-date bibliographies as well as "how do we know?" call out sections that highlight the experimental or technical foundations for major concepts, principles, or methodological advances in each area. Aimed at senior undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty in neuroscience, medicine, endocrinology, psychiatry, psychology and cognate disciplines, the Handbook of Neuroendocrinology satisfies an unmet need that will prove useful at the laboratory bench as well as in the office.

	abstract = {Leading researchers examine the usefulness and limitations of fuzzy logic for the psychology of concepts. 
The classical view of concepts in psychology was challenged in the 1970s when experimental evidence showed that concept categories are graded and thus cannot be represented adequately by classical sets. The possibility of using fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic for representing and dealing with concepts was recognized initially but then virtually abandoned in the early 1980s. In this volume, leading researchers--both psychologists working on concepts and mathematicians working on fuzzy logic--reassess the usefulness of fuzzy logic for the psychology of concepts.
The book begins with two tutorials--one on concepts and the other on fuzzy logic--aimed at making relevant experimental and theoretical issues accessible to researchers in both fields. The contributors then discuss the experiments that led to the rejection of the classical view of concepts; analyze the various arguments against the use of fuzzy logic in the psychology of concepts and show that they are fallacious; review methods based on sound measurement principles for constructing fuzzy sets; introduce formal concept analysis and its capabilities when generalized by using fuzzy logic; consider conceptual combinations; examine lexical concepts; and propose a research program based on cooperation between researchers in the psychology of concepts and fuzzy logic.},

It explores women's education and upbringing; their reading practices; the meanings of the social spaces and activities in which they engaged and how this fed over into the realm of politics; and the fashion for tourism at home and abroad.

	abstract = {Patrick Riley was born in Paris in 1935 and was educated in Zurich and at King Edward VII School, King's Lynn. He graduated from University College Hospital Medical School in 1960 and gained his Ph.D. from the Department of Dermatological Histopathology under Arthur Jarrett. He joined the Department of Claude Rimington and began a series of cellular studies culminating in his appointment to a Chair of Cell Pathology at UCL in 1984. His work covered many fundamental aspects of cell pathology including free radical pathology, cell size control, regulation of cell proliferation and cancer. Patrick Riley was a founder member of the European Society for Pigment Cell Research and the International Federation of Pigment Cell Societies. He was the organiser and Chairman of the XVth International Pigment Cell Conference. He was the recipient of the Myron Gordon Award in 1993 and the Centenary Medal of Charles University. He has published extensively on melanocytes, melanogenesis and melanoma. He was joint Charman with Jan Borovansky of the recent FEBS Symposium on Melanins and Melanogenesis. 

Jan Borovansky was born in Prague in 1943. He graduated from Faculty of General Medicine, Charles University in 1966 and gained his Ph.D. in 1976 from the Department of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry under Professor J. Duchon. From 1970 to 1980 he was Lecturer in Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry. In 1980 he defended his Habilitation Thesis and became Associate Professor at the Charles University, and in 2004 he was appointed a Full Professor of Biochemistry. In 2008 he was elected to the Senate of the 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague. From the outset of his research career he has been involved in biochemical studies of melanosomes, and the enzymes associated with them. He has also published important studies on metal binding by melanins, the cytotoxicity of zinc, and free radical processes in normal and malignant pigment cells. Since 1979 he has been member of the International Pigment Cell Society and following its transformation into European Society for Pigment Cell Research (ESPCR) he was elected to its Council (1990-1998). In 1981 he was General Secretary of the 3rd European Workshop on Melanin Pigmentation and in 1998 he was President of the 8th Meeting of the ESPCR organized in Prague. As a long-standing member of the Editorial Board of Pigment Cell Research (1995-1998) he received a special Certificate of Appreciation from the International Federation of Pigment Cell Societies and Munksgaard in 1999. Since 2000 he has been a member of the International Board of the Pigment Cell Research Bulletin to which he regularly contributes with critical bibliographical reviews concerning melanosomes. He is a member of the Editorial Board of Folia Biologica (Prague) (2006-present) and a member of the Board of Advisors of the American Biographical Institute. He was an Honorary Research Fellow at University College London (1980, 1984) and has been a Visiting Scientist at several other institutions including Sheffield University (1978) and Leiden University Medical Centre (1997). He was the recipient of the Annual award of the Czechoslovak Oncological Society in 1975. Recently, he was appointed a member of the Organizing Committee of the 34th FEBS Meeting held in Prague and was responsible for planning the Symposium on Melanins and Melanogenesis.},

The results have been momentous. Scientists have identified more than twenty species of extinct humans. They have firmly established Africa as the birthplace not only of humankind but also of modern humans. They have revealed how early technology, language ability, and artistic endeavour all originated in Africa; and they have shown how small groups of Africans spread out from Africa in an exodus sixty thousand years ago to populate the rest of the world.

Experiences of Freedom opens with an introductory philosophical essay by Achille Mbembe and is divided into four sections that consider: * resisting history and colonialism * the right to move and to belong * the right to (believe in) free futures * imaginative freedom and critical engagement. Each section contains a piece of creative writing directly connected to these topics from authors Chris Abani, Anita Desai, Caryl Phillips, and Alexis Wright, followed by a selection of critical essays.

	abstract = {While it is true that members of most sexually reproducing species can be defined as either male or female, those who belong to the rest of the biological world are not so simply understood. Hermaphroditic creatures reproduce both as male and as female individuals, providing a fascinating glimpse into alternative sexual practices in nature and their ecological and evolutionary successes and failures. Eloquently written by an award-winning biologist and pioneer in molecular ecology, this primer on hermaphroditism traces the phenomenon throughout Earth's myriad species, accounting for the adaptive significance of alternative sexual systems. Accessible and richly illustrated, the text maps the evolutionary origins of hermaphroditism, as well as its historical instances and fictional representations, underscoring the relevance of dual sexuality to our biological, intellectual, and cultural making. John C. Avise describes the genetics, ecology, phylogeny, and natural history of hermaphroditic plants, fish, and invertebrate animals and details organisms that either reproduce simultaneously as male and female or switch routinely between one sex and the other. Filled with surprising creatures and compelling revelations, this textbook stands alone in its clear yet comprehensive treatment of hermaphroditism and its unique challenge to the supremacy of separate sexes.},

The unimaginable had happened right on the doorstep of the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus. Many of the first responders were from the University, persevering in the midst of chaos and disbelief. In the ensuing weeks, research and engineering teams from the University reviewed the wreckage, searched for causes, and began planning for the future. The City, the River, the Bridge represents another set of responses to the disaster. Stemming from a 2008 University of Minnesota symposium on the bridge collapse and the building of a new bridge, it addresses the ramifications of the disaster from the perspectives of history, engineering, architecture, water science, community-based journalism, and geography. Contributors examine the factors that led to the collapse, the lessons learned from the disaster and the response, the policy and planning changes that have occurred or are likely to occur, and the impact on the city and the Mississippi River. The City, the River, the Bridge demonstrates the University's commitment to issues that concern the community and shares insights on public questions of city building, infrastructure, and design policy.

This collection of essays, which celebrates the achievement of the Swedish Africanist and postcolonial scholar Raoul Granqvist, deal with the broad theme of exit - in the form of exile, displacement, suicide, endings and, indeed, beginnings. After all, "In my end is my beginning" (T.S. Eliot).

Childhood as exit rite in contemporary African literature (Camara Laye's
L'Enfant Noir and Ishmael Beah's
Long Way Gone); the Cameroonian director Jean Pierre Bekolo's controversial film
Les Saignantes; an early play by Wole Soyinka; Ghana during the First World War; Zakes Mda's
Cion; proto-nationalist writing on the Gold Coast; passing in Zoë Wicomb's
Playing in the Light; the exile of South African and Caribbean writers; translation theory in the global South; public representations of Africans in north-east Bavaria; oral poetry in rural England; Fred Wah's Swedish-Chinese background in twentieth-century Canada; Toni Morrison's
Beloved and infanticide; the open endings of the poetry of Paul Muldoon; the suicide of Virginia Woolf; the viability of global environmental policies - these are some of the topics that this book, in defiance of neat disciplinary boundaries, addresses. The closing section, "Voicing the Exit," transcends the academic format with its evocative literary representations of the experience of exit (in Tanzania, Uganda, Ukrainian Canada and elsewhere).},

"The editors fully achieved their goal of producing a state-of-the-science stress reference for use by investigators, educators, and practitioners with clinical and health interests."--
Psycho-Oncology
"This is an important book about the scientific study of stress and human adaptation. It brings together both empirical data and theoretical developments that address the fundamental question of how psychosocial variables get inside the body to influence neurobiological processes that culminate in physical disease." From the Foreword by
David C. Glass, PhD
Emeritus Professor of Psychology
Stony Brook University
Edited by two leading health psychologists,
The Handbook of Stress Science presents a detailed overview of key topics in stress and health psychology. With discussions on how stress influences physical health-including its effects on the nervous, endocrine, cardiovascular, and immune systems-the text is a valuable source for health psychologists, as well as researchers in behavioral medicine, neuroscience, genetics, clinical and social psychology, sociology, and public health.
This state-of-the-art resource reviews conceptual developments, empirical findings, clinical applications, and investigative strategies and tools from the past few decades of stress research. It represents all major approaches to defining stress and describes the themes and developments that characterize the field of health-related stress research.
The five sections of this handbook cover:


Current knowledge regarding the major biological structures and systems that are involved in the stress response
Social-contextual contributions to stress and to processes of adaptation to stress, including the workplace, socioeconomic status, and social support
The concept of cognitive appraisal as it relates to stress and emotion psychological factors influencing stress such as, personality, gender, and adult development
The evidence linking stress to health-related behaviors and mental and physical health outcomes
Research methods, tools, and strategies, including the principles and techniques of both laboratory experimentation and naturalistic stress research},

Unlike most of the recent Anglo-centric literature that tends to focus almost exclusively on Darwin and natural selection, it follows the work of naturalists of many nationalities who used paleontology, comparative anatomy, and embryology in order to establish a linear continuity of evolving life though the long span of geological time. 

Thorough historical survey of the development of the concept of evolution before the publication of Darwin's 'The Origin of Species'.
Providing an alternative view of the recent literature and journal articles commemorating Darwin's 200th birthday and the 150th anniversary of publication of 'The Origin of Species'.

Alex McBirney, a retired professor of Geology at the University of Oregon is the author of several books on the history of science, as well as his many studies on volcanology and igneous petrology. He developed an interest in Darwin while working in the Galapagos Islands and learned about Perrier's long-overlooked book through his friend, Philippe Janvier, at the Museum of Natural History in Paris. He saw that it was a very scholarly book of broad interest, but after reading few pages he realized why it had been almost totally ignored. Much of the text is very convoluted and almost incomprehensible, even to native French speakers. Enlisting the help of two colleagues, Gregory Retallack, a paleontologist, and Stanton Cook, a biologist, he undertook the task of translating it into a more readable form, so that it would be available to wide audience. The text has been annotated to take into account more recent work, and an extensive Glossary and Biographical Index have been added to provide a ready reference to the technical terms and persons cited in the text.},

	abstract = {This book is designed for the neurologist who (in this day of unusually strict accountability) needs to have at hand an authoritative guide to the diagnostic criteria for all conditions that he or she may be faced with in clinical practice. While originally conceived as a compendium of diagnostic criteria, the author has felt the need to expand the work to include definitions of practically all terms that are used in neurology today. Historical elements are also provided--including entries of important neurologists and neurosurgeons who have impacted the field. The result is an effective representation of the tools of the trade for the neurologist in training and a concise and precise source for the practicing neurologist. The second edition was published in 2003. Since then, advances in the definition of many neurological conditions have been made, all of which have been incorporated in the third edition. There has also been a fine tuning of the definitions and diagnostic criteria of many other conditions. The author has collated over 1300 articles since the last edition in order to update many of the entries. As such, the entries will have the most up-to-date definition of diseases, symptoms, diagnostic tests, and pearls of wisdom. The third edition remains an invaluable guide to the spectrum of neurological practice and with nearly 7,000 references this truly is the bible of neurological terms and conditions.},

"No one predicted it could have happened so quickly. We can't protect the Great Lakes if there's no water in them ... The cocktail of assaults may be pushing the Great Lakes toward a tipping point, an irreversible change in the food web."                Venturing "light ship" (without cargo) across the stormy lakes of autumn can be unsettling. When 50-knot northerly winds lash the surface of Lake Erie, sending some lakers into sheltered anchorages, Captain [George Wheeler] decides to maintain course. Lake Erie is shallower than the other Great Lakes and more likely to be whipped up by storms. Ships at anchor off Toledo, Ohio, may suddenly find themselves aground when a short-term natural effect called "seiching" (pronounced "SAY-shing") drives surface water towards Buffalo, N.Y., at the eastern end of Lake Erie.                Sewage overflows are a major problem. "During heavy rainstorms," [Cameron Davis] says, "it's easy for treatment plants to risk being overwhelmed. There are two things we can do to help: Conserve water, so that we're not using as much, and use 'green infrastructure,' like rooftop gardens, to cut the amount of stormwater that needs to be treated."},

Whereas traditional descriptions of noun inflection are notoriously complex and filled with exceptions and irregularities, this reference guide provides a systematic and straightforward characterization of nominal paradigms, which also captures important generalizations about the inflection of nouns. Andrew Carnie proposes ten declension classes instead of the traditional five and separates off. seven major types of plural formation. He provides fully inflected paradigms for 1200 nouns, and a reference list of 10,000 Irish nouns annotated with their new declension class, their plural type and the form of the genitive singular and common case (nominative) plural. The book also includes. parallel information on the inflection of adjectives and prepositions.

	abstract = {Health risks are dynamic and ever-changing, both at home and while traveling abroad. To stay abreast of the most up-to-date health recommendations, for decades health care professionals and travelers have relied on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's user-friendly Health Information for International Travel (commonly referred to as the The Yellow Book) as a trusted reference. Updated biennially by a team of experts, this book is the only publication for all official government recommendations for international travel. The book's features include clear and easy-to-read disease risk maps, information on where to find health care during travel, specific health information and itineraries for popular tourist destinations, detailed country-specific information for yellow fever and malaria, advice for those traveling with infants and children, and a comprehensive catalog of diseases, their clinical pictures, and their epidemiologies. The Yellow Book addresses the pre-travel consult and provides post-travel clinical guidance on ways to approach common syndromes of returned travelers who are ill.},

	abstract = {The ubiquitous marine microalgal species Phaeocystis plays an important role in biogeochemical cycles. Phaeocystis has a complicated life cycle, which makes it hard to decipher the role of this organism in ecosystem dynamics and hence its role in elemental cycles. This volume offers a selection of papers that have been presented at the final meeting of Working Group \# 120 "Phaeocystis, major link in the biogeochemical cycling of climate-relevant elements", of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research (SCOR). The combination of a diverse yet well selected spectrum of scientific disciplines - varying from phylogeny to microbiogeochemistry and ecological modeling - makes this a very complete volume; it will no doubt become an important reference to all those working with Phaeocystis. This book comprises important review papers by various top authors in the field. Topics that are addressed reach from the organism level (taxonomy and life cycles) to ecosystem dynamics (interaction with viruses and grazing dynamics). The role of Phaeocystis in carbon cycling is focus of various chapters, as well as its role in sulphur cycling. The last treatise of this volume comprises a synthesis of all the presentations of the meeting. This chapter highlights the most relevant insights that have been gained so far and defines urgent questions that need to be addressed in future research.High quality papers by leading authors Complete coverage of topics (including review papers and new science) Topics of broad geoscience relevance Up-to-date knowledge},

	url = {http://proxy.lib.sfu.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/books/illusion-certainty/docview/2131300572/se-2?accountid=13800},
	abstract = {The Illusion of Certainty: Health Benefits and Risks peels away the "veneer of certainty" which many of us attach to health risk and benefit information given to us in our daily lives. It was written and designed primarily to assist the public in comprehending and interpreting the uncertainty associated with the overwhelming amount of information on medical and environmental health risks.  The book uses unique, visual presentations and case studies to explain the benefits of medical screening tests (e.g., mammography, prostate and colorectal cancer screening, cholesterol screening) and drugs (e.g., statins, Vioxx(tm)) and the risks associated with exposure to environmental contaminants (e.g., lead, dioxin, radon).  This book will help patients and their families get more involved in making medical decisions, and citizens face critical questions about the environment. By putting the complexities of risk analysis in terms the general public can relate to, the authors are empowering people to make well-informed decisions. 
About the Authors:
Erik Rifkin is the president of an environmental consulting firm that specializes in the characterization of ecological and human health risks from exposure to soil, water, air and sediments. His firm provides assistance and guidance to federal and state regulatory agencies and corporations regarding the nature and magnitude of environmental risks and potential remediation strategies. Dr. Rifkin's broad experience includes the communication of health risks and benefits to groups concerned with these issues.
Edward J. Bouwer is Professor of Environmental Engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.  He has extensive experience with water and soil pollution and treatment.  His research provides guidance on defining and managing environmental risks and how to interpret human and ecological health risk data.  Dr. Bouwer has served on several National Research Council committees that provide guidance on managing human and ecological risk
Guest Author Bob Sheff, MD, received his medical training as a radiologist at UCLA and Johns Hopkins Medical Center. He spent his career praticing medicine and running one of the largest medical managed-care systems in the U.S. Now semi-retired, he devotes his time to helping non-profit organizations and individual people address their medical concerns. He lives in Columbia, Maryland.
Written for:
Undergraduate, graduate, medical and nursing students, engineers, government advisory agencies, research scientists, lawyers, politicians and anyone interested in risk analysis and the interpretation of risk values.
This book provides the reader with an understanding and appreciation of the risk assessment process and the ability to objectively interpret health risk values. Included is an explanation of the uncertainty inherent in the assessment of risks as well as an explanation of how the communication and characterization of risks can dramatically alter the perception of those risks. Risk statements tend to be presented as if they are authoritative, definitive, and based on clear and unequivocal evidence, which leads to the illusion of certainty. In this context, this book compares and contrasts the differences between risk assessment and causality. Case studies illustrate the strengths and limitations of characterizing certain risks. Using the accepted risk assessment paradigm proposed by the National Research Council, these case studies illustrate which risk values have merit and why other assessments fail to meet basic criteria.
Foreword is written by Dr. Jared Cohon, President of Carnegie Mellon University
Of interest to millions of people who are concerned with true benefit of screening tests such as mammography, prostate cancer screening, cholesterol screening and colorectal cancer screening
Informs the public on true risks and benefits of taking statins, drugs such as Vioxx(tm), the risks of smoking and the risks of exposure to environmental contaminants such as dioxin, mercury and radon
Provides practical information and tools to make informed decision on risk and benefits
Book is written to explain complex concepts in an accessible manner

The Sea Grant program has been a major source of funding in the United States for work in the areas of marine aquaculture, shellfish disease, aquatic nuisance species, coastal and estuarine ecology, seafood safety, marine biotechnology, marine engineering, marine technology development, and marine policy. An earlier National Research Council report (1994) recommended that Sea Grant develop a process to review the individual programs on a four year cycle. A review process was implemented in 1998 and modified by Congress in the 2002 reauthorization of the Sea Grant program. The legislation also contained a request for this National Research Council study to provide an assessment of the review process and recommendations for ways to improve the overall effectiveness of the evaluation process to ensure fairness, consistency, and enhancement of performance. The report recommends strengthening the strategic planning process for the individual programs, increasing the interaction between the National Sea Grant Office and the individual programs, and improving the program rating and ranking process through annual assessments by the national office. In addition, the report provides recommendations for improving the independent reviews that are conducted on a four year cycle.

A review process was implemented in 1998 and modified by Congress in the 2002 reauthorization of the Sea Grant program. The legislation also contained a request for this National Research Council study to provide an assessment of the review process and recommendations for ways to improve the overall effectiveness of the evaluation process to ensure fairness, consistency, and enhancement of performance. The report recommends strengthening the strategic planning process for the individual programs, increasing the interaction between the National Sea Grant Office and the individual programs, and improving the program rating and ranking process through annual assessments by the national office. In addition, the report provides recommendations for improving the independent reviews that are conducted on a four year cycle.},

	abstract = {Over the last few years, the language of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology has expanded enormously to the extent that few scientists can expect to be familiar with all the terms and concepts. This is partly due the massive influence of the Genome and successive "-omics" projects which have developed in to many new areas of research. At the same time, terms from other subject areas - including mathematics, statistics, physics and other life sciences - appear increasingly in the; biochemical literature.; The Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology provides a comprehensive and 'encyclopaedic' survey of modern biochemistry and molecular biology. This new edition of the popular dictionary has been comprehensively reviewed and updated to include many important new concepts and words. The entries are short but informative, providing up-to-date information on a broad range of topics, including definitions for terms from the fields of Bioinformatics, Biophysics, Cell Biology,; Chemistry, Genetics, Immunology, Mathematics, Microbiology, Pharmacology, Systems Biology, and Toxicology. There are over 21000 main entries, which include: details of biochemical substances and the processes in which they are involved, methods and concepts in molecular biology, and definitions of biochemical; symbols and abbreviations. Each entry is accessibly written. They point out pitfalls where terms are often confused, and explain the precise syntax of biochemical terms such as Greek letters and other formatting, which are invariably lost when searching the Internet. In addition, the dictionary is generously illustrated with over 900 chemical structures.; The Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology will serve as an invaluable reference text for student and professional biochemists and molecular biologists seeking information both from within and outside their own fields. It will also be of relevance and use to a broader audience of life scientists seeking an authoritative overview of fundamental principles.},

	abstract = {The job of any sensory system is to create objects in the world out of the incoming proximal stimulus energy. The energy is neutral; it does not specify the objects itself. Thus, sensory systems must abstract the energy that does specify objects and differentiate it from the noise energy. The perceptual variables that specify objects for both listening and looking become those of contrast and correlated change across space and time, so that perceiving occurs at several spatial and temporal scales in parallel. Given that the perceptual goals and perceptual variables are equivalent, the rules of perceiving will be the same for all senses.The goal of this book is to describe these conceptual similarities and differences between hearing and seeing. Although it is mathematical and conceptually analytical, the book does not make explicit use of advanced mathematical concepts. Each chapter combines information on hearing and seeing, and gives a detailed treatment of a small number of topics. The first three chapters present introductory information, including properties of auditory and visual worlds, how receptive fields are organized to pick out those properties, and whether the receptive fields are optimized to pick up the structure of the sensory world. Each subsequent chapter considers one type of perceptual element: texture, motion, contrast and noise, color, timbre, and object segmentation. Each type of perceptual situation is described as a problem of discovering the correlated energy, and the research presented focuses on how humans manage to perceive given the complicated set of skills required. This book is intended for use in upper-division undergraduate courses in perception and sensation, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience. It will fill the slot between textbooks that cover perception and sensory physiology and neuroscience, and more advanced monographs that cover one sense or topic in detail.},

	abstract = {Widely considered cute and virtually always the first wild animal encountered by most of us, Eastern grey squirrels generally blend into the background, except when they're begging for bread crumbs. Of course, they're not without their bad habits. Eastern grey squirrels - which are commonly black in many areas, especially southern Ontario - are expert at raiding bird feeders and will occasionally search inside poorly covered garbage cans and bags for a quick meal, but are generally considered more curious than notorious.                 Grey squirrels don't just outcompete red squirrels, which are about one-third their size, they also take their nest holes and kill their young. Worse yet, grey squirrels carry parapoxvirus, a disease also known as squirrel pox, which is harmless in greys but often fatal in reds. The overall result has been the greys have largely replaced reds wherever greys exist. According to a 1995 study commissioned by the European Squirrel Initiative, a watchdog group representing national governments and universities, there were about 2 million Eastern grey squirrels in England and no more than 30,000 reds.                 "All data gathered in Britain and Italy confirm that in areas colonized by the grey squirrel, the native red squirrel rapidly becomes extinct," says Piero Genovesi, a professor at the University of Bologna, a researcher with the Italian Wildlife Institute and an expert on the squirrel invasion. "In Piedmont, the grey squirrel had been confined until 1970 within the suburbs of Turin in Stupinigi Park where the red squirrel was also present. The last observation of a red squirrel there was recorded during the winter of 1979-80."},

In broad general terms, at the POSC all candidates night, questions will be entertained which directly pertain to federal jurisdiction, addressing matters which impact negatively on our heritage activities, eg. angling, hunting, trapping and recreational target shooting plus firearm ownership.


Insects hiding in packaging materials also enter our continent, with the potential of wiping out massive acreages of forest lands.

	abstract = {Categorization, the basic cognitive process of arranging objects into categories, is a fundamental process in human and machine intelligence and is central to investigations and research in cognitive science. Until now, categorization has been approached from singular disciplinary perspectives with little overlap or communication between the disciplines involved (Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Cognitive Anthropology). Henri Cohen and Claire Lefebvre have gathered together a stellar collection of contributors in this unique, ambitious attempt to bring together converging disciplinary and conceptual perspectives on this topic.Categorization is a key concept across the range of cognitive sciences, including linguistics and philosophy, yet hitherto it has been hard to find accounts that go beyond the concerns of one or two individual disciplines. The Handbook of Categorization in Cognitive Science provides just the sort of interdisciplinary approach that is necessary to synthesize knowledge from the different fields and provide the basis for future innovation.  Professor Bernard Comrie, Department of Linguistics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Germany Anyone concerned with language, semantics, or categorization will want to have this encyclopedic collection.

The book deals with a range of issues, from the effects of the GI Bill to the effects of school environment on student learning, from the political realities of educational policy to social realities of teachers. Like subsequent volumes, this book brings together evidence and insights on educational change issues from leading writers and researchers in the field from across the world.Brings together evidence and insights on educational change issues from leading writers and researchers in the field from across the world Will help educators understand and deal effectively with the immensely complex change problems that are customary today Each of the four volumes of this Handbook of Educational Change form state-of-the-art collections of analyses of eductional change processes and practices},

Within the basic structure of simple genetic material lies the limitless potential for the existence of all living things, be they man or beast. So, too, within the simple structure of the sonnet, there is a similar universe of untold possibilities. Now, in these robust and stylish poems, the mysteries of the animal kingdom are explored with genuine scientific curiosity and rendered with tenderness, stimulating language and unmistakable Irish wit. From the reviled Portuguese man o' war to the glorious hyacinth macaw, from the elusive snow leopard to the bizarre pangolin and even to the human animal itself, Cole demonstrates how life exists in inexplicable but nonetheless indispensable variety. This collection serves to remind us what we stand to lose if we fail to appreciate the small states of grace that befall us in the disappearing natural wonders of our world.},

"[Belle Ewart] has a good, long public pier where people catch yellow perch, bass and the odd pike. And they can fish off the shore in Innisfil Beach Park. It's a great place for a family to spend a couple of hours - Innisfil residents are lucky to have it so near."


"The adults stay in Georgian Bay and migrate up the Nottawasaga River and various tributaries - including Innisfil Creek - to lay their eggs in March and April. Brook trout are a resident species and remain in Innisfil Creek all year long - they are predominately in the headwaters near Line 5," he said.},

The editors set the stage with an extended introduction to historical controversies and cutting-edge empirical methods for Rorschach validation. Each chapter presents a different Rorschach scoring system. A brief history is followed by detailed information on scoring and interpretation, a comprehensive summary of evidence bearing on construct validity, and discussion of clinical applications, empirical limitations, and future directions. A user-friendly scoring "manual" for each system offers readers practical guidance. The systems tap a broad array of content areas including ego defenses, thought disorder, mental representations of self and others, implicit motives, personality traits, and potential for psychotherapy.

Critics of Fahnenstiel's idea to shut the canal for good say it would cripple the economy of Niagara and the region surrounding the Great Lakes. "It just doesn't make sense," said Port Colborne Mayor Ron Bodner, whose city is still bisected by the fourth canal built in 1932.


Aside from the economic destruction the canal closing would bring, Bodner said it would have widespread environmental impacts across the Great Lakes region if the 32-million tonnes of coal, grain, steel slabs and other cargo that is shipped via the canal each year had to be delivered by transport truck.},

The closure would surely cause economic, trade and logistical problems, but it would eliminate the spread of invasive species in all of the Great Lakes except Ontario, [Gary Fahnenstiel] said.


Fahnenstiel said compared to complex environmental problems such as global climate change, the solution for saving the Great Lakes from invasive species is relatively simple. He said it just means stopping sea-going ships from entering the lakes.


Fahnenstiel said he would support a proposal by some Canadian scientists to stop transatlantic shipping at Montreal and have loads transferred to Great Lakes ships. That would lead to an environmental solution -- and full use of the underutilized Great Lakes fleet -- without closing the canal, he said.},

	abstract = {How do brand names differ from other names, and what goes into making a good name great and a bad name ghastly? Knowing this can spell the difference between bankruptcy and marketplace triumph. In this indispensable guide, the authors share the secrets of successful brand names-how they've indelibly stamped cultures around the world; who makes them; why they're made; and how they're compiled, bought, sold, and protected. The book outlines what kind of names exist-the initialized, descriptive, allusive, and coined. How namers surf on brainwaves. The do's, don'ts, and nevers of naming, how the structure of names is built from the ground up and how their sounds are engineered. Why names symbolize benefits. Where in the world brands may be found, and what will become of them. Fast-paced, illustration-packed, gazing at the past and probing into the future, this is the definitive book on naming. "The Making of A Name" is the one book anyone interested in "owned words" must have. "Right now, all over America, millions of freelancers are starting companies, inventing products and marketing their services.; Whether they're laid-off dot-com kids or unfulfilled Boomers, they have one thing in common-they all need names. Sadly for them, there's no book on the market that lays out the process. Rivkin and Sutherland's book will fill that gap. It's packed with useful 'how to' as well as tales both inspiring and cautionary: back-stories on the brand names we know-and whywe love or hate them.},

	abstract = {Speaking to a group of Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources employees at MNR's Peterborough headquarters, Dr. [John Casselman] outlined the plight of the eel. Earlier this week Ontario's natural resources minister David Ramsay announced plans to close both the commercial and sport harvest of eels in Ontario and to help find ways for eels to safely pass through dams and turbines on the St. Lawrence River as they head down river for the Sargasso Sea to spawn.


The American eel has been harvested for centuries by aboriginal peoples along the St. Lawrence in a system of traps called weirs. Ontario's commercial harvest of eels (a delicacy in Europe) peaked at about 500,000 pounds in 1978 and remained stable at 228,000 to 273,000 pounds between 1984 and 1993. But since then, Dr. Casselman says, the commercial harvest has declined precipitously to less than 30,000 pounds in 2003. Since 1998, the number of eels reaching the ladder around the Moses Saunders dam at Cornwall has dropped from a million a year (early 1980s) to fewer than 3,500 per year.


In addition to Ontario (and New York state) plans to close the eel harvest, the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the maritime provinces are working to develop a plan to protect eels. There is an inter-state initiative in the U.S. to protect eels and the Atlantic coastal states are seeking to have the eel designated under the U.S. endangered species act.},

	abstract = {Garden Insects of North America is the most comprehensive and user-friendly guide to the common insects and mites affecting yard and garden plants in North America. In a manner no previous book has come close to achieving, through full-color photos and concise, clear, scientifically accurate text, it describes the vast majority of species associated with shade trees and shrubs, turfgrass, flowers and ornamental plants, vegetables, and fruits--1,420 of them, including crickets, katydids, fruit flies, mealybugs, moths, maggots, borers, aphids, ants, bees, and many, many more. For particularly abundant bugs adept at damaging garden plants, management tips are also included. Covering all of the continental United States and Canada, this is the definitive one-volume resource for amateur gardeners, insect lovers, and professional entomologists alike. To ease identification, the book is organized by plant area affected (e.g., foliage, flowers, stems) and within that, by taxa. Close to a third of the species are primarily leaf chewers, with about the same number of sap suckers. Multiple photos of various life stages and typical plant symptoms are included for key species. The text, on the facing page, provides basic information on host plants, characteristic damage caused to plants, distribution, life history, habits, and, where necessary, how to keep "pests" in check--in short, the essentials to better understanding, appreciating, and tolerating these creatures. Whether managing, studying, or simply observing insects, identification is the first step--and this book is the key. With it in hand, the marvelous microcosm right outside the house finally comes fully into view. Describes more than 1,400 species--twice as many as in any other field guide Full-color photos for most species--more than five times the number in most comparable guides Up-to-date pest management tips Organized by plant area affected and by taxa for easy identification Covers the continental United States and Canada Provides species level treatment of all insects and mites important to gardens Illustrates all life stages of key garden insects and commonly associated plant injuries Concise, clear, scientifically accurate text Comprehensive and user-friendly},

The strongly comparative orientation of the contributions allow for the identification of broad similarities as well as intriguing differences across a wide range of historically and socially diverse language histories. Two chapters by the editors provide an overview of the theoretical background and rationale of comparative standardization research, and outline directions for further research in the area.

Abrupt climate changes of the magnitude seen in the past would have far-reaching implications for human society and ecosystems, including major impacts on energy consumption and water supply demands.

Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises looks at the current scientific evidence and theoretical understanding to describe what is currently known about abrupt climate change, including patterns and magnitudes, mechanisms, and probability of occurrence. It identifies critical knowledge gaps concerning the potential for future abrupt changes, including those aspects of change most important to society and economies, and outlines a research strategy to close those gaps. Based on the best and most current research available, this book surveys the history of climate change and makes a series of specific recommendations for the future.

The biggest problem right now is the disruption of the natural order of things in our Great Lakes.

The overall aim of PRADS symposia is to advance the design of ships and other floating structures as a professional discipline and science by exchanging knowledge and promoting discussion of relevant topics in the fields of naval architecture and marine and offshore engineering. In line with the aim, in welcoming the new era, this Symposium is intended to increase international co-operation and give a momentum for the new development of design and production technology of ships and other floating structures for efficiency, economy, safety, and environmental production. The main themes of this Symposium are Design Synthesis, Production, Hydrodynamics, Structures and Materials of Ships and Floating Systems. Proposals for over 270 papers from 26 countries and regions within the themes were received for PRADS 2001, and about 170 papers were accepted for presentation at the symposium. With the high quality of the proposed papers the Local Organising Committee had a difficult task to make a balanced selection and to control the total number of papers for fitting into the allocated time schedule approved by the Standing Committee of PRADS. Volume I covers design synthesis, production and part of hydrodynamics. Volume II contains the rest of hydrodynamics, and structures and materials.},

	abstract = {In Genes, Categories and Species, Jody Hey provides an enlightening new solution to one of biology's most ironic and perplexing puzzles. When Darwin showed that life evolves, and that it does so by natural selection, he transformed our understanding of living things. But the very question Darwin addressed-the nature of species-continues to pose an awkward conundrum for biologists. Despite enormous efforts by a great many scholars, biologists still cannot agree on how to identify species or even how to define the word species. Genes, Categories, and Species is not like other books on the species problem, for it does not begin by asking, What is a species? Instead, it focuses on the very fact that biologists are stumped by species and their curious behavior in coping with that uncertainty. Faced with a persistent conundrum-and no lack of data on the subject-biologists who ponder the species problem have ceased to ask the most essential of scientific questions: What new information do we need to resolve the problem? This is the question that motivates this book and leads to the discoveries it reveals. The answer to the species problem lies not with the processes and patterns of biological diversity, Hey contends, but rather in the way the human mind perceives and categorizes that diversity. The promise of this book is twofold. First, it allows biologists to understand the causes of the species problem and to use this knowledge to avoid the major confusions that arise over species. Second, with its explanation of the species problem, it gives scholars and students of human nature a humbling example of how ill-suited the human mind is for certain kinds of scientific questions.a"},

Among its research projects is the study of tundra swan migration routes by radio-tracking, the continental decline of scaup ducks and black duck populations and the invasion of a plant species inhospitable to waterfowl.


Most spectacular of the present research subjects are the graceful tundra swans, which have tripled in population since the fifties. Seen locally in flocks of hundreds as they work their way northward, Long Point visitors are thrilled by literally thousands of the huge, snow-white birds. Dr.Petrie and his research staff pioneered the radio-tracking of tundra swans and the information gathered has been quite astounding.},

This fall, researchers at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Maryland, published a paper in the scientific journal, Nature, reporting on a project that discovered a multitude of micro-organisms in ballast water in ships entering Chesapeake Bay, including Vibrio cholera, the bacteria that causes cholera in humans. Chesapeake Bay alone receives 10 billion litres of foreign ballast water each year. Vibrio cholera was found in ballast samples in all ships tested by Smithsonian researchers.                 The Smithsonian study wasn't the first time cholera bacteria had been linked to ballast water. Nine years ago, when oysters in Mobile Bay, Alabama, tested positive for cholera bacteria, scientists discovered ballast water in three ships in the area also contained cholera bacteria. These ships had recently visited South America, where there had been an outbreak of cholera, which itself was also linked to ship ballast water.                 The United States now requires ships to report how they are handling their ballast to a National Ballast Water Clearing House established in conjunction with the coast guard at the Smithsonian Center. This fall, the Clearing House reported that only 20 per cent of the ships entering U.S. waters were reporting as required by law. Of the ships that did report an intention to discharge ballast water in U.S. waters, only about 20 per cent had undergone a complete mid- ocean ballast exchange.},

Some ports, like Vancouver, BC, have regulations requiring foreign ships to discharge ballast water at sea before entering the harbour, but many others do not. Furthermore, discharge alone does not remove all the organisms from the water, and if conditions are rough, ships don't have to obey the regulation for safety reasons. Currently, billions of litres of foreign ballast water are still finding their way into ports across North America, but there are few studies on the fate of the vast number of foreign microorganisms hitchhiking with it.},

	abstract = {This new Oxford Companion is the first comprehensive reference source for 20th-century literature in English from all round the world. It offers information on all significant international writers in English and their works: from America, the United Kingdom, and Australia, from Canada and New Zealand, India and Ireland, Africa and the Caribbean. Far more inclusive than any of its rivals, the book is alphabetically arranged, up to date, and cross-referenced throughout. -;This is a unique new reference book to English-language writers and writing throughout the present century, in all major genres and from all around the world - from Joseph Conrad to Will Self, Virginia Woolf to David Mamet, Ezra Pound to Peter Carey, James Joyce to Amy Tan. The survivors of the Victorian age who feature in The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Literature in English - writers such as Thomas Hardy, Olive Schreiner, Rabindranath Tagore, Henry James - could hardly have imagined how richly diverse Literature in English' would become by the end of the century. Fiction, plays, poetry, and a whole range of non-fictional writing are celebrated in this informative, readable, and catholic reference book, which includes entries on literary. movements, periodicals, and over 400 individual works, as well as articles on some 2,400 authors. All the great literary figures are included, whether American or Australian, British, Irish, or Indian, African or Canadian or Caribbean - among them Samuel Beckett, Edith Wharton, Patrick White, T. S. Eliot, Derek Walcott, D. H. Lawrence, Tennessee Williams, Vladimir Nabokov, Wole Soyinka, Sylvia Plath - as well as a wealth of less obviously canonical writers, from Ana--iuml--;s Nin to L. M. Montgomery, Bob Dylan to Terry Pratchett. The book comes right up to date with contemporary figures such. as Toni Morrison, Ben Okri, Salman Rushdie, Carol Shields, Tim Winton, Nadine Gordimer, Vikram Seth, Don Delillo, and many others. Title entries range from Aaron's Rod to The Zoo Story; topics from Angry Young Men, Bestsellers, and Concrete Poetry to Soap Opera, Vietnam Writing, and Westerns. A lively introduction by John Sutherland highlights the various and sometimes contradictory canons that have emerged over the century, and the increasingly international sources of writing in English which the Companion records. Catering for all literary tastes, this is the most comprehensive single-volume guide to modern (and postmodern) literature. -},

When the Atlantic salmon were killed off in Lake Ontario, they were replaced with rainbow trout and coho salmon. When the whitefish, herring, lake trout, blue pike and sturgeon of the Upper Lakes were poisoned and netted, fisheries departments introduced smelts, chinook salmon, splake and pink salmon.                 We're caught in a dangerous environmental game with the Great Lakes. We've hammered them by spewing poisons from our factories and towns. Now our tax dollars are being spent to attack them genetically for short-term gain. Tourism operators and fishermen may like the big, new trophy fish, but the stocking program has been a genetic assault on the lakes that will be hard to justify in the long term.},

	abstract = {The Kentucky Encyclopedia's 2,000-plus entries are the work of more than five hundred writers. Their subjects reflect all areas of the commonwealth and span the time from prehistoric settlement to today's headlines, recording Kentuckians' achievements in art, architecture, business, education, politics, religion, science, and sports. Biographical sketches portray all of Kentucky's governors and U.S. senators, as well as note congressmen and state and local politicians. Kentucky's impact on the national scene is registered in the lives of such figures as Carry Nation, Henry Clay, Louis Brandeis, and Alben Barkley. The commonwealth's high range from writers Harriette Arnow and Jesse Stuart, reformers Laura Clay and Mary Breckinridge, and civil rights leaders Whitney Young, Jr., and Georgia Powers, to sports figures Muhammad Ali and Adolph Rupp and entertainers Loretta Lynn, Merle Travis, and the Everly Brothers. Entries describe each county and county seat and each community with a population above 2,500. Broad overview articles examine such topics as agriculture, segregation, transportation, literature, and folklife. Frequently misunderstood aspects of Kentucky's history and culture are clarified and popular misconceptions corrected. The facts on such subjects as mint juleps, Fort Knox, Boone's coonskin cap, the Kentucky hot brown, and Morgan's Raiders will settle many an argument. For both the researcher and the more casual reader, this collection of facts and fancies about Kentucky and Kentuckians will be an invaluable resource.
The Kentucky Encyclopedia is available on-line for libraries and other subscribers. See www.kyenc.com for information.},

	abstract = {Earlier this month, 130 imported red deer - a larger, stronger relative of our own white-tail deer - were slaughtered in Owen Sound after they became infected with a deadly neurological parasite. The parasite, known as "muscle worm," has the potential to devastate our native populations of deer and moose, biologists say.                 In 1990, tuberculosis epidemics at a number of Alberta game farms resulted in the slaughter of more than 2,000 elk and red deer. And 10 Alberta cattle ranchers later tested positive for TB - an ominous sign, critics say.                 If these animals escape and establish themselves in the wild, ecological havoc can result when they compete with existing species. This has already occurred on a large scale in some U.S. states, where red deer have virtually eliminated the white-tail deer in certain areas.},

	abstract = {Aquatic biologist Paul Bertram of the Environmental Protection Agency, [Joseph Makarewicz]'s research associate, agreed: "Lake Erie was never dead. Lake Erie had too much life in it."                 As the populations of predatory fish expanded, they began consuming and dramatically reducing the numbers of alewives, perch and minnows in Lake Erie. The decrease in smaller fish numbers took the pressure off smaller, algae-eating zooplankton, such as water fleas, and the algae-eaters became much more abundant.                 "These things are like vacuum cleaners; they are very, very adept at grazing algae," Makarewicz said. So the combined result of less phosphorus and more game fish was that Lake Erie's water began clearing up.},

New industries with new technologies no longer make it necessary to locate industry in cities, and social and fiscal pressures are drawing people out into the countryside. Thus a conflict is growing with cities dying for lack of industry and new housing-- whilst conservationists resist the spread of development into the green belts or further into the rural landscape. This book is an important contribution to a contemporary debate which is of significance to everyone living in Britain: the need for a land-use policy which looks simultaneously at the towns and country and strikes a balance between urban and rural renewal},
