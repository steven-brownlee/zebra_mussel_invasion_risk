	abstract = {Adult molluscs produce shells with diverse morphologies and ornamentations, different colour patterns and microstructures. The larval shell however, is a phenotypically more conserved structure. How do developmental and evolutionary processes generate varying diversity at different life history stages? Using live-imaging, histology, scanning electron microscopy and transcriptomic profiling, we have described shell development in a heteroconchian bivalve the Antarctic clam, Laternula elliptica and compared it to adult shell secretion processes in the same species. Adult downstream shell genes, such as those encoding extracellular matrix proteins and biomineralisation enzymes, were largely not expressed during shell development, and instead, a development-specific downstream gene repertoire was expressed. Upstream regulatory genes such as transcription factors and signalling molecules were conserved between developmental and adult shell secretion. Comparing heteroconchian transcriptomic data with recently reported pteriomorphian larval shell proteome data suggests that, despite being phenotypically more conserved, the downstream effectors constituting the larval shell tool-kit may be as diverse as that of adults. Overall, our new data suggests that a larval shell formed using development-specific downstream effector genes is a conserved and ancestral feature of the bivalve lineage, and possibly more broadly across the molluscs.

	abstract = {The potential for trophic transfer of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was assessed using the green algae Tetraselmis suecica and the blue mussel Mytilus edulis in a series of laboratory experiments. Swanee River Natural Organic Matter (SRNOM)-dispersed SWCNTs were introduced into growing algal cultures. Light microscopical observations, confirmed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy, showed that SWCNT agglomerates adhered to the external algal cell walls and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) results suggested internalization. A direct effect of SWCNT exposure on the algae was a significant decrease in growth, expressed as chlorophyll a concentration and cell viability. Mussels, fed with algae in the presence of SWCNTs, led to significantly increased pseudofaeces production, indicating selective feeding. Nevertheless, histological sections of the mussel digestive gland following exposure showed evidence of SWCNT-containing algae. Furthermore, DNA damage and oxidative stress biomarker responses in the mussel haemocytes and gill tissue were significantly altered from baseline values and were consistent with previously observed responses to SWCNT exposure. In conclusion, the observed SWCNT-algal interaction demonstrated the potential for SWCNT entrance at the base of the food chain, which may facilitate their trophic transfer with potential consequences for human exposure and health.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), recognized worldwide as emerging pollutants, may pose a substantial threat to human health and our environment due to their stability, high concentrations, wide distribution, and easy accumulation. Ever since perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid were recognized by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the public has become increasingly concerned about potential contamination and the environmental risks associated with PFASs. Ubiquitous PFAS contamination of drinking water, groundwater, surface water, and sediment has been detected, especially in areas with rapid industrial and economic development. Its accumulation in living organisms and foods has accentuated the importance of investigations into aquatic organisms at the bottom of the food chain, as the stability and integrity of the food web as well as the population quantity and structure of the aquatic ecosystem may be affected. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the toxic and toxicity-related effects of PFASs on aquatic plankton, aquatic invertebrates and microorganisms, the characteristics of different target aquatic organisms in toxicity investigations, and a feasibility evaluation of PFAS substitutes to provide valuable suggestions for further utilization and regulation of PFASs and their substitutes.},

	abstract = {Remediation of water quality by stimulating algal photosynthesis using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has attracted attention, but few studies have examined this in outdoor freshwater environments. To understand the effects of LED illumination on water quality, the dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature, pH, and electric conductivity were monitored over 5 months in three depressions with or without a red/blue LED light at the bottom of an experimental pond. The effects of the blue LED on water quality were evident in the period with less rainfall after the change of water quality to an equilibrium state; DO and pH were higher, and EC was lower for the blue LED than for the control. The diel changes of these variables were also lower for the blue LED. The effects of the red LED on DO and pH were also evident, but to a lesser extent compared to those of the blue LED. A vertical mixing of water associated with a nighttime cooling of the surface water was suggested by a rapid DO increase after a temperature decrease in the control. Such internal water circulation and an inflow of water after rainfall might have obscured the LED effects in the rainy period. The bottom water of the blue LED had a higher density and species richness of phytoplankton than that of the control at the end of the experiment. A lower density of phytoplankton and higher nutrient concentrations in the red LED might have been due to a higher density and feeding activity by zooplankton. Our results confirmed the applicability of LED illumination in stimulating algal photosynthesis, and in improving the oxygen condition of the bottom water in freshwater ponds.},

Este estudo quantificou as concentraçöes de clorofila-a na coluna de agua da bacia hidrográfica do rio Miranda - MS, situada na regiao oeste do Brasil, uma das principais formadoras do bioma Pantanal, para identificar as principais influencias na biomassa do fitoplâncton. Métodos: Temperatura, profundidade, velocidade de correnteza, turbidez, transparencia por Disco de Secchi, e concentraçöes de nutrientes, sólidos em suspensâo, e clorofila-a foram medidos a intervalos aproximadamente mensais, durante um ano, em cinco pontos do planalto e tres pontos na planicie. Relaçöes entre clorofila a e concentraçöes de nutrientes, tempo de viagem e disponibilidade de luz foram examinados. Resultados: Os niveis de nutrientes foram geralmente baixos, sendo oligo- a mesotrófico. Altas concentraçöes de sólidos em suspensâo foram encontradas (até aproximadamente 250 mg.L-1), especialmente na época chuvosa nos pontos no planalto. No planalto ocorreram baixas concentraçöes de clorofila-a, enquanto nos pontos da planicie, com exceçâo de um, ocorreram dois picos, no inverno (época seca) e no verâo (época chuvosa), de 4,9 e 2,4 pg.L'1, respectivamente, coincidindo com concentraçöes reduzidas de sólidos em suspensâo. Conclusoes: Os baixos niveis de nutrientes provavelmente estâo relacionados ao uso da terra, principalmente para pecuaria. As altas concentraçöes de sólidos devem estar relacionadas a degradaçâo da vegetaçâo nativa, especialmente da mata ciliar nas últimas décadas. O tempo de viagem de aproximadamente tres a quarto dias nos pontos de planalto, comparado ao tempo de aproximadamente dez dias nos pontos da planicie, podem ter sido um fator determinante na diminuiçâo da abundância de algas no planalto, enquanto a limitaçâo por luz poderia ter sido importante diminuindo o crescimento de algas na planicie.Alternate abstract:Aim: Knowledge of the factors influencing the biomass of phytoplankton in rivers is important with reference to the characterization of water quality and predicting the effects of environmental change on such ecosystems. The present study quantified the concentrations of chlorophyll-a in the water column of the Miranda River Basin, located in western Brazil, contributing to form the Pantanal Wetland, and attempted to identify the primary environmental influences on the phytoplankton biomass. Methods: Temperature, depth, current speed, turbidity, Secchi transparency and concentrations of nutrients, suspended solids and chlorophyll-a were measured at approximate monthly intervals during the course of a year, at five upland and three lowland sites. Relationships between chlorophyll-a and nutrient concentrations, travel times and light availability were examined. Results: Nutrient levels were generally low, being oligo- to mesotrophic. High levels of suspended solids were recorded (up to approximately 250 mg.L-1), especially in the rainy season at the upland sites. The latter showed low chlorophyll-a concentrations, while lowland sites, with the exception of one, showed two peaks, one in winter (dry season) and the other in summer (wet season), of 4.9 and 2.4qg.L-1, respectively, coincident with reduced concentrations of suspended solids. Conclusions: The low nutrient levels recorded may have been due to the main land use being cattle rearing. The high solids concentrations found may have been due to the degradation of native vegetation, especially riparian, that has occurred over the past decades. Travel times of approximately three to four days may have been a factor in retarding algal abundance in the upland sites, as opposed to approximately ten days in the lowland sites, where light limitation may have been a factor reducing algal growth.},

The widespread use of these substances over the years has led to a significant increase of their presence in the marine environment. These compounds were identified as environmental and human threats. As a result of an international ban, research in the last decade has focused on developing a new generation of benign antifoulant paints. This review outlines the detrimental effects associated with biocide versus eco-friendly antifoulants, highlighting what are effective antifoulants and why there is a need to monitor them. We examine the effects of biocide and eco-friendly antifoulants on the antioxidative defence mechanism and settlement in a higher sessile organism, specifically the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis. These antifoulants can indirectly assess the potential of these two parameters in order to outline implementation of sustainable antifoulants.},

Comparison of the main indicators of phytoplankton in the reservoirs was carried out together with its spatial distribution. It was found that the distribution of coenotic groups of plankton in the cooling reservoir corresponds to thermal conditions. In the Alexandrovskoye reservoir, separate communities of plankton are formed along its length. The description of indicator species of algae in two reservoirs is given. The important role of the catchment basin was demonstrated with statistical maps.

	abstract = {The relationship between humans and plastics has become intricate due to their versatile nature and low production cost. Plastics generation has surpassed that of other manufactured products, which, coupled with the prevailing poor waste management systems, makes it a serious problem for the terrestrial and aquatic environments as its final destination. Their extensive presence has continued to pose a significant threat, not only to the aquatic ecosystem but also to the approximately 3 billion people relying on it for their livelihood. Even more disturbing were the recent findings of these plastics in food and drinking water and the evidence of human exposure, the long-term health effects of which are largely unknown. This ubiquitous phenomenon has over time put plastics under critical observation, leading to the development of many local and international policies, resolutions, and directives aimed at addressing and reversing the menace. This review provided the first snapshot of the global and local governance strategies currently aimed at mitigating plastic pollution, their limitations, and future directions. The findings of the review revealed several aspects of microplastics (MPs) pollution to be overlooked in policy formulation, a laxity in policy implementation, and an apparent lack of indices to ascertain the impact of the regulations. Furthermore, there is currently no regulation on MPs contamination of food and drinking water and an apparent lack of funding for research into the health effects of plastics and their alternatives. This, therefore, necessitates the need for a well-coordinated approach at international and national levels to scale up these policies in all countries and translate them from paper to measurable, holistic, and realizable actions that will address all forms of plastic pollution.},

The presence of P. leniusculus was detected through this new LAMP assay in all but one of the nine sites sampled. No correlation was found between ddPCR absolute concentration measurements and the number of LAMP-positive technical replicates. However, we showed that using dependent technical replicates could significantly enhance the detection sensitivity of the LAMP assay. Applied to other assays, it could improve sensitivity and thus allow for a more efficient use of eDNA-based LAMP assays for invasive species detection in aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The contamination of marine water bodies with petroleum hydrocarbons represents a threat to ecosystems and human health. In addition to the surface slick of crude oil, the water-soluble fraction of petroleum is responsible for the induction of severe toxic effects at different cellular and molecular levels. Some petroleum-derived hydrocarbons are classified as carcinogenic and mutagenic contaminants; therefore, the oil spill into the marine environment can have long term consequences to the biota. Therefore, new tools able to remediate crude oil water accommodation fraction pollution in marine water are highly recommended. Nanomaterials were recently proposed in environmental remediation processes. In the present in vivo study, the efficacy of pure anatase titanium nanoparticles (n-TiO2) was tested on Dicentrarchus labrax exposed to the accommodated fraction of crude oil. It was found that n-TiO2 nano-powders themselves were harmless in terms of DNA primary damage, and the capability of pure anatase n-TiO2 to lower the levels of DNA damage induced by a mixture of genotoxic pollutant was revealed. These preliminary results on a laboratory scale are the prerequisite for deepening this new technology for the abatement of the cellular effects related with oil spill pollutants released in marine environments.},

	abstract = {Based on the Baltic Earth Assessment Reports of this thematic issue in Earth System Dynamics and recent peer-reviewed literature, current knowledge of the effects of global warming on past and future changes in climate of the Baltic Sea region is summarised  and assessed. The study is an update of the Second Assessment of Climate Change (BACC II) published in 2015 and focuses on the atmosphere, land, cryosphere, ocean, sediments, and the terrestrial and marine biosphere. Based on the summaries of the recent knowledge gained in palaeo-, historical, and future regional climate research, we find that the main conclusions from earlier assessments still remain valid. However, new long-term, homogenous observational records, for example, for Scandinavian glacier inventories, sea-level-driven saltwater inflows, so-called Major Baltic Inflows, and phytoplankton species distribution, and new scenario simulations with improved models, for example, for glaciers, lake ice, and marine food web, have become available. In many cases, uncertainties can now be better estimated than before because more models were included in the ensembles, especially for the Baltic Sea. With the help of coupled models, feedbacks between several components of the Earth system have been studied, and multiple driver studies were performed, e.g. projections of the food web that include fisheries, eutrophication, and climate change. New datasets and projections have led to a revised understanding of changes in some variables such as salinity. Furthermore, it has become evident that natural variability, in particular for the ocean on multidecadal timescales, is greater than previously estimated, challenging our ability to detect observed and projected changes in climate. In this context, the first palaeoclimate simulations regionalised for the Baltic Sea region are instructive. Hence, estimated uncertainties for the projections of many variables increased. In addition to the well-known influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation, it was found that also other low-frequency modes of internal variability, such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability, have profound effects on the climate of the Baltic Sea region. Challenges were also identified, such as the systematic discrepancy between future cloudiness trends in global and regional models and the difficulty of confidently attributing large observed changes in marine ecosystems to climate change. Finally, we compare our results with other coastal sea assessments, such as the North Sea Region Climate Change Assessment (NOSCCA), and find that the effects of climate change on the Baltic Sea differ from those on the North Sea, since Baltic Sea oceanography and ecosystems are very different from other coastal seas such as the North Sea. While the North Sea dynamics are dominated by tides, the Baltic Sea is characterised by brackish water, a perennial vertical stratification in the southern subbasins, and a seasonal sea ice cover in the northern subbasins.},

This study consisted of four trials examining the effects of direct transfer from hard (345 mg/L CaCO3) to soft water on mortality and glucose stress response of two different sizes and strains of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. The first trial subjected 90 g Shasta strain rainbow trout to a direct transfer to soft water (70 or 160 mg/L as CaCO3). The second trial used the same strain and size trout, with transfer to lower hardness values of either 0 or 35 mg/L. The third and fourth trials used 3 to 5 g Arlee strain rainbow trout. The third trial transferred the fish from 345 mg/L hardness water to water at a hardness of either 0 or 35 mg/L. The fourth trial added a secondary temperature stressor of 20 °C (versus the experimental standard of 11 °C) in combination with a hardness level of 0 mg/L. In every trial, survival was not significantly different among all treatments. Sudden and extreme changes in water hardness, even in combination with increased water temperature, did not cause trout mortality. There was also no significant difference in blood glucose over time among any of the treatments in the first three trials. In the fourth trial, glucose values did significantly vary among the treatments at 48 and 168 h after the start of the trial. However, all glucose values were relatively close to the basal level. These results indicate that changes in water hardness likely do not impact the survival of rainbow trout, negating the need for tempering or acclimation.},

	abstract = {The ubiquitous presence of microplastics in bivalve mollusks and related risks have raised particular concerns. In this study, the available data on the abundance and polymer type of microplastics in bivalves from twenty-two countries were extracted to comprehensively understand the risks of microplastics in bivalves. Following the data from 52 peer-reviewed papers, the abundance, chemical composition, and human exposure risks of microplastics of bivalves among countries were initially assessed. Abundance risk results indicated that bivalves from 22 countries presented a low pollution load index, showing a lower risk level (level I). The polymer risk index (H) of bivalves from Portugal (Hcountry = 1335, level IV) and India (Hcountry = 1187, level IV) were higher than the other countries due to the occurrence of hazardous microplastics, such as polyvinyl chloride. For the human exposure risks, the global mean value of microplastic exposure to humans via mollusk consumption is estimated to be 751 microplastics/capita/year, with the maximum intake by the Chinese. This study suggests that abundance risk may be a fundamental indicator for assessing the potential hazard to humans until the chemical composition risks are confirmed. This study is the first attempt to assess the potential risks of microplastics in bivalves using three evaluation models based on microplastic abundances and polymer types, which will contribute to establishing future human health risk assessment frameworks. These findings will also assist efforts in policy-making to minimize microplastic risks in seafood.},

	abstract = {We present a case study for Bayesian analysis and proper representation of distributions and dependence among parameters when calibrating process-oriented environmental models. A simple water quality model for the Elbe River (Germany) is referred to as an example, but the approach is applicable to a wide range of environmental models with time-series output. Model parameters are estimated by Bayesian inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. While the best-fit solution matches usual least-squares model calibration (with a penalty term for excessive parameter values), the Bayesian approach has the advantage of yielding a joint probability distribution for parameters. This posterior distribution encompasses all possible parameter combinations that produce a simulation output that fits observed data within measurement and modeling uncertainty. Bayesian inference further permits the introduction of prior knowledge, e.g., positivity of certain parameters. The estimated distribution shows to which extent model parameters are controlled by observations through the process of inference, highlighting issues that cannot be settled unless more information becomes available. An interactive interface enables tracking for how ranges of parameter values that are consistent with observations change during the process of a step-by-step assignment of fixed parameter values. Based on an initial analysis of the posterior via an undirected Gaussian graphical model, a directed Bayesian network (BN) is constructed. The BN transparently conveys information on the interdependence of parameters after calibration. Finally, a strategy to reduce the number of expensive model runs in MCMC sampling for the presented purpose is introduced based on a newly developed variant of delayed acceptance sampling with a Gaussian process surrogate and linear dimensionality reduction to support function-valued outputs.},

	abstract = {Background: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are persistent pollutants routinely detected in aquatic ecosystems. It is, therefore, necessary to assess the link between deleterious marine biota PAH effects, especially in commercialized and consumed animals, environmental health status, and potential human health risks originating from the consumption of contaminated seafood products. Thus, this review seeks to verify the relationships of ecotoxicological studies in determining effect and safety concentrations on animals routinely consumed by humans. Methods: A total of 52 published studies between 2011 and 2021, indexed in three databases, were selected following the PICO methodology, and information on test animals, evaluated PAH, and endpoints were extracted. Results: Benzo(a)pyrene and phenanthrene were the most investigated PAHs in terms of biomarkers and test organisms, and mussels were the most evaluated bioindicator species, with an emphasis on reproductive responses. Furthermore, despite the apparent correlation between environmental PAH dynamics and effects on aquatic biota and human health, few assessments have been performed in a multidisciplinary manner to evaluate these three variables together. Conclusions: The links between human and environmental sciences must be strengthened to enable complete and realistic toxicity assessments as despite the application of seafood assessments, especially to mussels, in bioassays, the connection between toxicological animal responses and risks associated with their consumption is still understudied.},

This mussel has experienced population declines across large parts of its distribution and is imperiled in many jurisdictions. Obovaria olivaria uses the similarly imperiled Acipenser fulvescens (Lake Sturgeon) as a host for its glochidia. We employed mitochondrial DNA sequencing and restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) to assess patterns of genetic diversity and population structure of O. olivaria from 19 collection locations including the St. Lawrence River drainage, the Great Lakes drainage, the Upper Mississippi River drainage, the Ohioan River drainage, and the Mississippi Embayment. Heterozygosity was highest in Upper Mississippi and Great Lakes populations, followed by a reduction in diversity and relative effective population size in the St. Lawrence populations. Pairwise FST ranged from 0.00 to 0.20, and analyses of genetic structure revealed two major ancestral populations, one including all St. Lawrence River/Ottawa River sites and the other including remaining sites; however, significant admixture and isolation by river distance across the range were evident. The genetic diversity and structure of O. olivaria is consistent with the existing literature on Acipenser fulvescens and suggests that, although northern and southern O. olivaria populations are genetically distinct, genetic structure in O. olivaria is largely clinal rather than discrete across its range. Conservation and restoration efforts of O. olivaria should prioritize the maintenance and restoration of locations where O. olivaria remain, especially in northern rivers, and to ensure connectivity that will facilitate dispersal of Acipenser fulvescens and movement of encysted glochidia.},

We used multivariate and Partial Least Squares Path Modeling to analyze the seasonal variation in crustacean zooplankton and related environmental factors from winter 2009 to winter 2016 in Lake Poyang, the largest freshwater lake in China. We found a distinct seasonal pattern in zooplankton development, which deviated, in part, from the PEG model, as we found indications of (1) a weaker degree of food limitation in winter and spring, likely due to high concentrations of allochthonous sources caused by decomposition of seasonally flooded hygrophytes, also affecting sediment dynamics; (2) a peak in crustacean zooplankton biomass in summer when the water level was high (and predation was lower), and where horizontal transport of zooplankton from the littoral zone to the pelagic was possibleand (3) a higher predation pressure in autumn, likely due to a shrinking water volume that left the fish concentrated in less water. The majority of these differences can be attributed to the direct or indirect impacts of physical factor variation.},

Mytilus first of all, principally determine mussel populations as a powerful natural biofilter. Both marine and freshwater mussels consume relatively large amounts of seston, feeding directly on the primary producers. Particles with contaminants extracted from ambient water during the filtration are accumulated in mussel pseudofaeces and faeces discharged after digestion. These specific particles of faeces and soft pseudofeaces become very suitable substrata for bacteria development with following contaminant destruction. Moreover, such biodeposits appeared to be the nutritious food for bottom detritophages, in particular of polychaetes and amphipods. Some fluid metabolites excreted by mussels, i.e. dissolved organic matter (DOM) have a pronounced biological activity to producers. In general, mussels possess high resistance to acute and chronic pollution stress, although their growth may slow down and even stops. In clean conditions food supply is the most important factor in determining activity and growth rate of mussels for northern environment. Mussel and some other aquaculture, as a relatively new application of environmental engineering is able to improve the recycling of nutrients from wastewater to bioproduction and greatly reduce the risk of environmental degradation in the coastal zone.},

In the context of this re-evaluation process the following substances used as sweeteners were considered: acesulfame-K (E 950), salt of aspartame-acesulfame (E 962), sucralose (E 955), saccharins (E 954), thaumatin (E 957), neohesperidine DC (E 959), neotame (E 961), cyclamates (E 952) and the polyol sweeteners (sorbitols (E 420); mannitol (E 421); isomalt (E 953); maltitols (E 965); lactitol (E 966); xylitol (E 967) and erythritol (E 968)). Data was collated using a systematic review approach. Generally, the data identified was extremely limited particularly with respect to neohesperidine DC, neotame, thaumatin and the polyol sweeteners. However, there was also limited evidence to suggest their widespread occurrence in the environment. With respect to acesulfame-K, sucralose, cyclamates and saccharin multiple studies were identified that demonstrate the widespread distribution of these sweeteners in surface waters, groundwaters, coastal and marine waters. There are also studies showing their presence in drinking (tap) water supplies, rainwater and in atmospheric samples. However, these sweeteners do not appear to be highly toxic to aquatic species, at least not at environmental concentrations currently seen. The salt of aspartame-acesulfame easily dissociates into its two component sweeteners in the human body and the environment and so the review process also considered aspartame despite it not being a specific focus of the regulatory review process. Whilst there is some evidence to suggest aspartame is toxic to aquatic species it is not detected at levels of concern in the environment.},

	abstract = {Given the ecological and socioeconomic importance of estuaries, the impacts of climate change on their structure and functioning is a major focus of concern, even more when the affected species support important fisheries as the venerid clams Ruditapes decussatus, R. philippinarum, Venerupis corrugata, and the cockle Cerastoderma edule in Europe whose reproductive performance, in the context of climate stressors, has not yet been investigated. Thus, our objective was to experimentally evaluate the potential effect of low salinity and atmospheric heatwave stresses on their reproductive cycle. To test it, bivalves were exposed during six days to four different salinity ramps (5-20, 10-25, 15-30, 30-30) during simulated tidal cycles over three different periods of the year (autumn, winter and spring); also, in summer, they were exposed to atmospheric heatwaves at low tide (20, 27, 32, 37°C) during four consecutive days. Histological slides were analyzed to determine their gametogenetic stage and a gonadal index was calculated. Both low salinity and heatwave stresses compromised reproduction but the response was species-specific dependent and varied with the time of the year, therefore with the gametogenic cycle. In December, during sexual resting and the beginning of gametogenesis, a delay in the gametogenesis was recorded in the four species at lower salinities. In March and May, at the peak of the reproductive period, the response was different; abnormal oocytes in R. decussatus and resorption of gametes with hemocytic infiltration in R. philippinarum and V. corrugata were observed. Sediment temperatures higher than 32ºC provoked gonadal resorption and severe hemocytic invasion in V. corrugata, R. decussatus and C. edule but no effect in R. philippinarum. These responses were related to the allocation of energy from reproduction towards defense and repair mechanisms to ensure survival. Contrastingly, low salinities triggered massive spawning in C. edule that could lead to a mismatch between the presence of larvae and phytoplankton, causing potentially starvation and thus reducing recruitment success. For short-lived species as these bivalves if low salinity episodes in winter and spring are followed by a heatwave in summer, reproduction would be compromised, and the impact magnified if this situation happens during consecutive years},

	abstract = {Mussels are considered highly efficient marine biomonitors, tracing anthropogenic and natural variations in heavy metals and various organic compounds. While heavy metals depuration processes in biomonitors are of growing interest, less knowledge is available regarding their Pb isotopes and rare earth elements (REEs) accumulation-release dynamics, and their response to short-term anthropogenic and terrigenous perturbations. Here, we report the results of a relocation experiment where a group of mussels (Brachidontes pharaonis) were extracted from a contaminated lagoon in the Gulf of Aqaba, northern Red Sea, and placed in water tables that were flushed continuously with fresh, uncontaminated seawater. Pairs of mussels were removed periodically from the water table over a period of 13 weeks and trace and rare earth elements and Pb isotopic compositions were determined separately for mussel shells and soft tissue. The results display a clear decrease over time in the concentrations of various heavy metals and REEs in the soft tissue, in concert with a similar shift in the Pb isotopic compositions towards seawater values. By contrast, the elemental and isotopic composition of the shell presents little change over time. Coupling between the Pb isotopic composition of corresponding soft tissue and shell samples allows back-calculation of the timing and magnitude of abrupt contamination events and provides quantitative constraints on long and short-term contamination events. Importantly however, considering the shallow coastal environment, the results may be biased by contributions of terrigenous material. Accordingly, Al-normalized element concentrations, Pb isotopes and the Ce anomalies, enabled the identification of two distinct terrigenous end members controlling the two sites. In summary, the study demonstrates the potential of using mussels as robust biomonitors of natural and anthropogenic environmental perturbations through the combination between elemental concentrations and the isotopic composition of Pb.},

One particular issue that warrants further characterization is the hazards associated with chemical additives within micro(nano)plastic as they are not chemically bound within the polymers and can be persistent and biologically active. Most plastics contain additives and are therefore potential vectors for the introduction of these chemicals into the environment as they leach from plastic, a process that can be accelerated through degradation and weathering processes. There are knowledge gaps on the ecotoxicological effects of plastic additives and how they are released from parent plastic materials as they progressively fragment from the meso to micro and nano scale. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of the ecotoxicity of plastic additives and identifies research needs to characterize the hazard they present to exposed biota. The potential ecological risk of chemical additives is of international concern so key differences in governance between the European Union and New Zealand to appropriately characterize their risk are highlighted.},

The approach used here highlighted the ease of incorporating ecological mechanisms into population models so researchers can take full advantage of available long-term ecosystem information. Long term studies of fish assemblages can be used to inform changes in community structure resulting from perturbations to aquatic systems and understanding these changes in fish assemblages can be better contextualized by grouping species according to functional groups that are grounded in niche theory. We hypothesized that describing the biological process based on partial pooling of information across functional groups would identify shifts in fish assemblages that coincide with major changes in the ecosystem (e.g., for this study, shifts in zooplankton abundance over time). Herein, we analyzed a long-term Lake Michigan fisheries dataset using a multi-species state space modeling approach within a Bayesian framework. Our results suggested the population growth rates of planktivores and benthic invertivores have been more variable than general invertivores over time and that trends in planktivores can be partially explained by ecosystem changes in zooplankton abundance. Additional work incorporating more ecosystem parameters (e.g., primary production, etc.) should be incorporated into future iterations of this novel modeling concept.},

A decrease in the species richness and area of growth of macrophytes, a simplification of the structure of communities was noted. The renewal of plant communities in the places of their origin was recorded, primarily due to the species resistant to biogenic pollution. A decrease in the abundance of submerged species with wide leaves was revealed, which is an indicator of an increase in water turbidity. The species were found in the phyto- and zooplankton community, living in conditions of an increased content of nutrients and suspended matter. There was no significant decrease in the species diversity of summer plankton and benthos, and the quantitative indicators are comparable with the data before the work. A feature of the restoration of the zooplankton and benthic community was the appearance of brackish-water species in the river branches, which were not previously recorded there, incl. alien species of mollusks and polychaetes.},

	abstract = {The risks posed by plastic debris to the environment and human health, depend on several factors, including their 1) tendency to remain colloidally stable in the aquatic environment, 2) transport potential in natural aquatic environments, including the subsurface, and 3) potential to act as vectors for other pollutants in ecosystems. An improved understanding of the key processes and factors that govern the behaviour of plastic debris under realistic environmental conditions will contribute towards providing mitigating strategies for plastic pollution as well as improved risk assessment.In the first part of this thesis, the scientific literature was critically reviewed and used to determine an estimate of plastic loads and pathways in different environmental compartments. The key factors controlling the aggregation, deposition and contaminant cotransport of microplastics in the aquatic environment were identified and critically analyzed. From the critical data synthesis, it was shown that the rubbery polymer, polyethylene, generally has a higher contaminant sorption capacity than other synthetic plastic types. Important gaps in the literature that preclude our understanding of the risks associated with nanoplastics and microplastics in the aquatic environment were identified.To address some of these knowledge gaps, the next part of this thesis investigated the role of climate and temperature cycling on nanoplastic transport. It is shown that by ignoring the effect of freeze-thaw, a key component of cold climate regions, previous conclusions on nanoplastic mobility might have been overestimated. Controlled laboratory experiments were used to show that exposure of nanoplastics to repeated freeze-thaw cycles, such as those experienced in cold climates will lead to aggregation and reduced transport in soils and subsurface environments. These experiments also provided insight into the strength of the freeze-thaw induced aggregates, showing that they are not prone to disaggregation even after applying a high shear force to disaggregate them. Although the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) significantly increases nanoplastic mobility, it was not sufficient to counter the impact of freeze-thaw.  In another study, the factors and mechanisms by which different plastic sizes interact with NOM (humic acid, fulvic acid and alginate) in simple and complex artificial and natural environmental matrices were investigated and compared. It was shown that the different organic molecules will interact with the different plastics in a size-specific manner. In the absence of NOM, the minimum CaCl2 concentration needed to destabilize the particle suspension is insensitive to plastic size. Although the presence of the polysaccharide alginate enhanced aggregation in CaCl2, it had no effect/stabilized nanoplastics in a complex ionic matrix. While there were no significant differences in the attachment efficiencies of both bare nanoplastics at the CCC (CaCl2) and in artificial seawater, the larger nanoplastics were more stable than the smaller ones in a natural seawater matrix. A critical literature review reveals that only ten percent of laboratory studies investigating the effects of microplastic pollution in ecosystems have used environmentally relevant (aged) particles. An extensive synthesis of laboratory effect studies in the context of environmentally relevant protocols for weathered microplastics, nanoplastics and leachates is presented which also provides a framework for method harmonization.Alternate abstract:Les risques que représentent les débris plastiques pour l'environnement et la santé humaine dépendent de plusieurs facteurs, dont leur tendance à rester colloïdalement stables, leur potentiel de transport et leur capacité à agir comme vecteurs d'autres polluants dans l'environnement aquatique. Une meilleure compréhension des processus et facteurs clés qui régissent le comportement des débris plastiques dans des conditions environnementales réalistes contribuera à l'élaboration de stratégies d'atténuation de la pollution plastique et à une évaluation précise des risques.  La littérature scientifique a fait l'objet d'un examen critique et a été utilisée pour déterminer les estimations des charges et des voies de pénétration des plastiques dans différents compartiments de l'environnement. Les facteurs clés contrôlant l'agrégation, le dépôt et le cotransport des contaminants des microplastiques (MPs) dans l'environnement aquatique, ainsi que les lacunes importantes dans les connaissances ont été identifiés et analysés de manière critique. La synthèse critique des données a montré que le polymère caoutchouteux, le polyéthylène, a généralement une plus grande capacité de sorption des contaminants que les autres types de plastique synthétique. La partie suivante de cette thèse a étudié le rôle du climat et des cycles de température sur le transport des nanoplastiques (NPs). Il est démontré qu'en ignorant l'effet du gel-dégel, un élément clé des régions à climat froid, les conclusions précédentes sur la mobilité des NPs pourraient avoir été surestimées. Des expériences contrôlées en laboratoire ont été utilisées pour montrer que l'exposition des NPs à des cycles répétés de gel-dégel, tels que ceux que l'on rencontre dans les climats froids, entraîne une agrégation et une réduction du transport, même en présence de matière organique naturelle dans les sols et les environnements souterrains.  Dans une autre étude, les facteurs et les mécanismes par lesquels différentes tailles de plastique interagissent avec les NOM (acide humique, acide fulvique et alginate) dans des matrices environnementales artificielles et naturelles simples et complexes ont été étudiés et comparés.  Il a été démontré que les différentes molécules organiques interagissent avec les différents plastiques d'une manière spécifique à leur taille. Les facteurs et mécanismes par lesquels différentes tailles de plastique interagissent avec la  NOM, la concentration minimale de CaCl2 nécessaire pour déstabiliser la suspension de particules est insensible à la taille du plastique. Bien que la présence de l'alginate polysaccharide ait augmenté l'agrégation dans le CaCl2, elle n'a eu aucun effet/stabilisation des NPs dans une matrice ionique complexe. Alors qu'il n'y avait pas de différences significatives dans les efficacités d'attachement des NPs nus au CCC (CaCl2) et dans l'eau de mer artificielle, les NPs plus grands étaient plus stables que les plus petits dans une matrice d'eau de mer naturelle. Une analyse critique de la littérature révèle que seulement dix pour cent des études en laboratoire portant sur les effets de la pollution MP dans les écosystèmes ont utilisé des particules pertinentes pour l'environnement (âgées). Une synthèse exhaustive des études de laboratoire sur les effets dans le contexte de protocoles pertinents sur le plan environnemental pour les MPs, les NPs et les lixiviats altérés est présentée et fournit également un cadre pour l'harmonisation des méthodes.},

	abstract = {With rapidly changing marine ecosystems, shifts in abundance and distribution are being documented for a variety of intertidal species. We examined two adjacent populations of Pacific razor clams (Siliqua patula) in lower Cook Inlet, Alaska. One population (east) supported a sport and personal use fishery, but this has been closed since 2015 due to declines in abundance, and the second population (west) continues to support commercial and sport fisheries. We used gene expression to investigate potential causes of the east side decline, comparing razor clam physiological responses between east and west Cook Inlet. The target gene profile used was developed for razor clam populations in Alaska based on physiological responses to environmental stressors. In this study, we identified no differences of gene expression between east and west populations, leading to two potential conclusions: (1) differences in factors capable of influencing physiology exist between the east and west and are sufficient to influence razor clam populations but are not detected by the genes in our panel, or (2) physiological processes do not account for the differences in abundance, and other factors such as predation or changes in habitat may be impacting the east Cook Inlet population.},

Thus, in 2002, a fish pass system, named Piracema Channel, was built to allow fish to access areas upstream of the reservoir. We tested the potential of environmental DNA metabarcoding to monitor the impact of both the dam and associated fish pass system in the Paraná River fish communities and to compare it with traditional monitoring methods. Using a fragment of the 12S gene, we characterized richness and community composition based on amplicon sequence variants, operational taxonomic units, and zero-radius OTUs. We combined GenBank and in-house data for taxonomic assignment. We found that different bioinformatics approaches showed similar results. Also, we found a decrease in fish diversity from 2019 to 2020 probably due to the recent extreme drought experienced in southeastern Brazil. The highest alpha diversity was recorded in the mouth of the fish pass system, located in a protected valley with the highest environmental heterogeneity. Despite the clear indication that the reference databases need to be continuously improved, our results demonstrate the analytical efficiency of the metabarcoding to monitor fish species.},

They represent environments with a great diversity of habitats and communities, high carbon sequestration capacity and a wide range of ecosystem services. In the Mediterranean, the largest coastal wetlands are found in deltaic areas like that of the Ebro River (Spain), which has a coastline length of approximately 50 km, occupying a total area of 325 km2. The Ebro Delta is included in different national and international frameworks for environmental conservation, despite which there are several risks that threaten it. The lack of sedimentary contributions due to the regulation of the Ebro riverbed (irrigation, reservoirs, and hydroelectric power generation) has caused erosion and the retreat of certain sections of its coastline. To this situation of sediment deficit must be added the threat posed by the effects of global change, such as the rise in sea level, the increase in temperature and in the frequency and intensity of storms. This study analyses the particularities of the coastal wetland of the Ebro Delta, identifying the main threats it faces, as well as possible adaptation and mitigation strategies to these changes.},

	abstract = {Wildlife research has been indispensable for increasing our insight into ecosystem functioning as well as for designing effective conservation measures under the currently high rates of biodiversity loss. Genetic and genomic analyses might be able to yield the same information on, e.g., population size, health, or diet composition as other wildlife research methods, and even provide additional data that would not be possible to obtain by alternative means. Moreover, if DNA is collected non-invasively, this technique has only minimal or no impact on animal welfare. Nevertheless, the implementation rate of noninvasive genetic assessment in wildlife studies has been rather low. This might be caused by the perceived inefficiency of DNA material obtained non-invasively in comparison with DNA obtained from blood or tissues, or poorer performance in comparison with other approaches used in wildlife research. Therefore, the aim of this review was to evaluate the performance of noninvasive genetic assessment in comparison with other methods across different types of wildlife studies. Through a search of three scientific databases, 113 relevant studies were identified, published between the years 1997 and 2020. Overall, most of the studies (94\%) reported equivalent or superior performance of noninvasive genetic assessment when compared with either invasive genetic sampling or another research method. It might be also cheaper and more time-efficient than other techniques. In conclusion, noninvasive genetic assessment is a highly effective research approach, whose efficacy and performance are likely to improve even further in the future with the development of optimized protocols.},

	abstract = {Shellfish, including the key species the common cockle Cerastoderma edule, living and feeding in waters contaminated by infectious agents can accumulate them within their tissues. It is unknown if microbial pathogens and microparasites can subsequently be transmitted via concomitant predation to their consumers, including shorebirds. The objective of this study was to assess if pathogens associated with C. edule could be detected seasonally in the faeces of shorebirds that feed on C. edule and in the physical environment (sediment) in which C. edule reside, along the Irish and Celtic Seas. Two potentially pathogenic global groups, Vibrio and Haplosporidia, were detected in C. edule. Although Haplosporidia were not detected in the bird faeces nor in the sediment, identical strains of Vibrio splendidus were detected in C. edule and bird faecal samples at sites where the oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and other waders were observed to be feeding on cockles. Vibrio spp. prevalence was seasonal and increased in C. edule and bird faecal samples during the warmer months, possibly due to higher seawater temperatures that promote the replication of this bacteria. The sediment samples showed an overall higher prevalence of Vibrio spp. than the bird faecal and C. edule samples, and its detection remained consistently high through the sites and throughout the seasons, which further supports the role of the sediment as a Vibrio reservoir. Our findings shed light on the fact that not all pathogen groups are transmitted from prey to predator via feeding but bacteria such as V. splendidus can be. As most of the wading birds observed in this study are migratory, the results also indicate the potential for this bacterium to be dispersed over greater geographic distances, which will have consequences for areas where it may be introduced.},

	abstract = {Nanoplastics (NPs) are considered emerging pollutants, namely unregulated contaminants whose toxic effect on humans and the environment has been demonstrated or suspected. They are the result of the physical fragmentation of the plastics that over time reach smaller dimensions ({\textless}100 nm). The issues related to the characterization and quantification of NPs in the environmental matrices are mainly related to the infinitepsimal size, to the fact that they are found in bulk, and to the different physico-chemical forms in which the same polymer can evolve over time by degradation. To deal with the study of a new class of pollutants it is necessary to assess the entire analytical method, carefully considering every single step (sampling, cleanup, qualitative, and quantitative analysis) starting from the validation method in the laboratory. This paper reviews the analytical method steps, focusing on the first ones, which the current literature often underestimates: laboratory tests, sampling, and sample processing; in fact, most errors and the quality of the analyses often depend on them. In addition, all newly introduced sample processing methods were examined.},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet (UV) filters are emerging contaminants of concern found ubiquitously in the aquatic environment. Many organic UV filters are endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) in vertebrates. However, few studies have assessed their effects on invertebrates. Ecdysis, or the shedding of the exoskeleton, is proposed to be a target of these compounds in the largest phylum of invertebrates, Arthropoda (insects and crustaceans). Ecdysis is regulated by an arthropod specific endocrine system, the ecdysteroid pathway, and alterations of this signaling cascade by EDCs results in improper development, reduced growth, or death. These outcomes may have significant implications for organismal and population health. In this dissertation, I test the overarching hypothesis that UV filters are endocrine disruptors of the ecdysteroid pathway in Daphnia magna by evaluating their effects on molting, development, and gene expression. In Chapter 2, I show that Daphnia magna chronically exposed to OMC, BP3, and 4MBC produce offspring with developmental abnormalities. Additionally, qPCR and RNAseq data demonstrate that BP3 and 4MBC affect the transcription of ecdysteroid-regulated genes. In Chapter 3, cellular transactivation assays are used to demonstrate that only one of these compounds, OMC, causes transactivation of the EcR. However, this only occurs in the presence of the endogenous hormone, indicating that a separate mechanism besides direct EcR agonism is likely for activation. In Chapter 4, OMC toxicity is further investigated using an ecdysteroid-responsive cell line. Several potential mechanisms of toxicity for this UV filter are identified using RNAseq analysis, including a possible connection to the juvenile hormone pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that UV filters appear to be both vertebrate and invertebrate endocrine disruptors. However, the concentrations needed to elicit toxicity are well above those levels detected in the environment and therefore the risk posed to aquatic invertebrates, such as Daphnia, is likely low based on the endpoints measured.},

Pharmaceuticals are among the many CECs that enter the environment through different pathways, with wastewater treatment plants being the main input of these pollutants. Several technologies for the removal of these pollutants have been developed through the years, but there is still a lack of sustainable technologies suitable for being applied in natural environments. In this regard, solutions based on natural biological processes are attractive for the recovery of contaminated environments. Bioremediation is one of these natural-based solutions and takes advantage of the capacity of microorganisms to degrade different organic pollutants. Degradation of pollutants by native microorganisms is already known to be an important detoxification mechanism that is involved in natural attenuation processes that occur in the environment. Thus, bioremediation technologies based on the selection of natural degrading bacteria seem to be a promising clean-up technology suitable for application in natural environments. In this review, an overview of the occurrence and fate of pharmaceuticals is carried out, in which bioremediation tools are explored for the removal of these pollutants from impacted environments.},

	abstract = {Early detection of environmental disturbances affecting shellfish stock condition is highly desirable for aquaculture activities. In this article, a new biophysical model-based early warning system (EWS) is described, that assesses bivalve stock condition by diagnosing signs of persistent physiological dysfunctioning. The biophysical model represents valve gape dynamics, controlled by active contractions of the adductor muscle countering the passive action of the hinge ligament; the dynamics combine continuous convergence to a steady-state interspersed with discrete closing events. A null simulation was introduced to describe undisturbed conditions. The diagnostic compares valve gape measurements and simulations. Indicators are inferred from the model parameters, and disturbances are assessed when their estimates deviate from their null distribution. Instead of focusing only on discrete events, our EWS exploits the complete observed dynamics within successive time intervals defined by the variation scales. When applied to a valvometry data series, collected in controlled conditions from scallops (Pecten maximus), the EWS indicated that one among four individuals exhibited signs its physiological condition was degrading. This was detected neither during experiments nor during the initial data analysis, suggesting the utility of an approach that quantifies physiological mechanisms underlying functional responses. Practical implementations of biological-EWS at farming sites are then discussed.},

In this work, we performed a detailed screening using available genome databases across a wide range of species to identify sequence members of the Natterin group, sequence similarities, conserved domains, and evolutionary relationships. The high-throughput tools have enabled us to dramatically expand the number of members within this group of proteins, which has a remote origin (around 400 million years ago) and is spread across Eukarya organisms, even in plants and primitive Agnathans jawless fish. Overall, the survey resulted in 331 species presenting Natterin-like proteins, mainly fish, and 859 putative genes. Besides fish, the groups with more species included in our analysis were insects and birds. The number and variety of annotations increased the knowledge of the obtained sequences in detail, such as the conserved motif AGIP in the pore-forming loop involved in the transmembrane barrel insertion, allowing us to classify them as important constituents of the innate immune defense system as effector molecules activating immune cells by interacting with conserved intracellular signaling mechanisms in the hosts.},

A worldwide increase in the use of antibiotics led to the emergence of antibiotic resistant strains in almost all bacterial pathogens, which complicates the treatment of infectious diseases. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria play an important role in increasing the risk associated with the usage of surface waters (e.g., irrigation, recreation) and the spread of the resistance genes. Many studies show that important pathogenic antibiotic-resistant bacteria can enter the environment by the discharge of sewage treatment plants and combined sewage overflow events. Mussels have successfully been used as bio-indicators of heavy metals, chemicals and parasites; they may also be efficient bio-indicators for viruses and bacteria. In this study an influence of the discharge of a sewage treatment plant could be shown in regard to the presence of E. coli in higher concentrations in the mussels downstream the treatment plant. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria, resistant against one or two classes of antibiotics and relevance for human health could be detected in the mussels at different sampling sites of the river Rhine. No multidrug-resistant bacteria could be isolated from the mussels, although they were found in samples of the surrounding water body.},

	volume = {21},
	url = {http://proxy.lib.sfu.ca/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/public-perceptions-lyme-disease-climate-change/docview/2514822718/se-2?accountid=13800},

	abstract = {Background 
Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change.
Methods
A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change.
Results
Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa.
Conclusions
This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences. A model showing the potential relationship between Lyme disease and climate change perceptions is proposed, and implications for engagement on climate change health impacts are discussed.},

	abstract = {Animal behaviour is becoming increasingly popular as an endpoint in ecotoxicology due to its increased sensitivity and speed compared to traditional endpoints. However, the widespread use of animal behaviours in environmental risk assessment is currently hindered by a lack of optimisation and standardisation of behavioural assays for model species. In this study, assays to assess swimming speed were developed for a model crustacean species, the brine shrimp Artemia franciscana. Preliminary works were performed to determine optimal arena size for this species, and weather lux used in the experiments had an impact on the animals phototactic response. Swimming speed was significantly lower in the smallest arena, whilst no difference was observed between the two larger arenas, suggesting that the small arena was limiting swimming ability. No significant difference was observed in attraction to light between high and low light intensities. Arena size had a significant impact on phototaxis behaviours. Large arenas resulted in animals spending more time in the light side of the arena compared to medium and small, irrespective of light intensity. The swimming speed assay was then used to expose specimens to a range of psychotropic compounds with varying modes of action. Results indicate that swimming speed provides a valid measure of the impacts of behaviour modulating compounds on A. franciscana. The psychotropic compounds tested varied in their impacts on animal behaviour. Fluoxetine resulted in increased swimming speed as has been found in other crustacean species, whilst oxazepam, venlafaxine and amitriptyline had no significant impacts on the behaviours measured. The results from this study suggest a simple, fast, high throughput assay for A. franciscana and gains insight on the impacts of a range of psychotropic compounds on the swimming behaviours of a model crustacean species used in ecotoxicology studies.},

Here we report comprehensive identification of genes involved in byssus formation through whole-genome and foot-specific transcriptomic analyses of the green mussel, Perna viridis. Interestingly, proteins encoded by highly expressed genes include proteinase inhibitors and defense proteins, including lysozyme and lectins, in addition to structural proteins and protein modification enzymes that probably catalyze polymerization and insolubilization. This assemblage of structural and protective molecules constitutes a multi-pronged strategy to render the byssus highly resistant to environmental insults.},

Monitoring programs and scientific evidence point to harmful algal blooms (HABs) increasing in frequency and intensity as a result of global climate alterations. Among marine toxins, the okadaic acid (OA) and the related dinophysistoxins (DTX) are the most frequently reported in EU waters, mainly in shellfish species. These toxins are responsible for human syndrome diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP). Fish, like other marine species, are also exposed to HABs and their toxins. However, reduced attention has been given to exposure, accumulation, and effects on fish of DSP toxins, such as OA. The present review intends to summarize the current knowledge of the impact of DSP toxins and to identify the main issues needing further research. From data reviewed in this work, it is clear that exposure of fish to DSP toxins causes a range of negative effects, from behavioral and morphological alterations to death. However, there is still much to be investigated about the ecological and food safety risks related to contamination of fish with DSP toxins.},

This clam, that can adapt to environmental changes, is an invasive species in several areas and it was adopted as a model for toxicity tests. This study evaluated the effects of the exposure to cadmium (Cd), to microplastics (MPs) and their mixtures on C. fluminea. The oxidative stress responses, lipid peroxidation (LPO), changes in the activity of energy-related enzymes and neurotoxicity were assessed on the gill, digestive gland and gonad. The results show that Cd, MPs and their mixtures cause oxidative stress, damage and neurotoxicity. The enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and the LPO levels could be chosen as biomarkers of Cd pollution. Exposure to MPs induced an increase in reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio and increased AChE activity. The combined exposure to Cd and MPs caused a synergetic effect in gill and gonad, while an antagonism response was recorded in the digestive gland. The results provide new insights for unveiling the biologic effects of heavy metal, microplastics and their mixtures on C. fluminea. Besides, we demonstrated that the Asian clam is a good bioindicator of microplastic pollution that can occur in aquatic environments.},

Such an approach is currently underway in the Western Lake Erie Basin, where the province of Ontario and the state of Ohio have embarked on a 40\% phosphorus run-off reduction target to address eutrophication problems in the lake. In this study, we adopt the concept of discourse to inform our understanding of the collaborative process undertaken to develop domestic action plans (DAPs) to guide efforts by various stakeholders. We find that in both cases there were distinct groups of actors who shared and promoted a particular narrative or storyline. These storylines provided varying accounts of the science and policy aspects of the eutrophication problem in Lake Erie, and there was variation as well in the specific actors to whom they attributed responsibility. We illustrate how the storylines shaped the nature and form of the action plans. We provide a discussion of the policy implications of unequal capacities among different actor coalitions to influence trajectories and outcomes in the context of governance for water quality. It is shown that the potential of discourse coalitions to influence policy raises important questions as to whose voice is considered legitimate enough to be included in the policy process.},

	abstract = {Urban Evolutionary Biology fills an important knowledge gap on wild organismal evolution in the urban environment, whilst offering a novel exploration of the fast-growing new field of evolutionary research. The growing rate of urbanization and the maturation of urban study systems worldwide means interest in the urban environment as an agent of evolutionary change is rapidly increasing.We are presently witnessing the emergence of a new field of research in evolutionary biology. Despite its rapid global expansion, the urban environment has until now been a largely neglected study site among evolutionary biologists. With its conspicuously altered ecological dynamics, it stands in stark contrast to the natural environments traditionally used as cornerstones for evolutionary ecology research.Urbanization can offer a great range of new opportunities to test for rapid evolutionary processes as a consequence of human activity, both because of replicate contexts for hypothesis testing, but also because cities are characterized by an array of easily quantifiable environmental axes of variation and thus testable agents of selection. Thanks to a wide possible breadth of inference (in terms of taxa) that may be studied, and a great variety of analytical methods, urban evolution has thepotential to stand at a fascinating multi-disciplinary crossroad, enriching the field of evolutionary biology with emergent yet incredibly potent new research themes where the urban habitat is key.Urban Evolutionary Biology is an advanced textbook suitable for graduate level students as well as professional researchers studying the genetics, evolutionary biology, and ecology of urban environments. It is also highly relevant to urban ecologists and urban wildlife practitioners.},

	abstract = {Comprehensively explains animal learning theories and current best practices in animal training within zoos 
This accessible, up-to-date book on animal training in a zoo/aquaria context provides a unified approach to zoo animal learning, bringing together the art and science of animal training. Written by experts in academia and working zoos, it incorporates the latest information from the scientific community along with current best practice, demystifying the complexities of training zoo animals. In doing so, it teaches readers how to effectively train animals and to fully understand the consequences of their actions.

Zoo Animal Learning and Training starts with an overview of animal learning theory. It describes the main categories of animal learning styles; considers the diverse natural history of zoo animals; reviews the research undertaken which demonstrates ultimate benefits of learning; and highlights the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches. It also shows how the direct application of learning theory can be integrated into zoo animal management; discusses how other factors might affect development; and investigates situations and activities from which animals learn. It also explores the theoretical basis that determines whether enrichments are successful.

Provides an easily accessibly, jargon-free introduction to the subject
Explores different training styles, providing theoretical background to animal learning theory as well as considerations for practical training programme - including how to set them up, manage people and animals within them and their consequences
Includes effective skills and 'rules of thumb' from professional animal trainers
Offers commentary on the ethical and welfare implications of training in zoos
Features contributions from global experts in academia and the zoo profession
Uniquely features both academic and professional perspectives

Zoo Animal Learning and Training is an important book for students, academics and professionals. It is ideally suited to senior undergraduate students in zoo biology, veterinary science, and psychology, and for post-graduate students in animal management, behaviour and conservation, as well as zoo biology. It is also beneficial to those working professionally in zoos and aquaria at different levels.

	abstract = {The integrated study of ocean health and human health is an emerging area of increasing global importance. Growing evidences demonstrate that the health of the ocean and the health of humans have always been and will continue to be, inextricably linked. Our actions towards the oceans will significantly influence the future of the whole planet and, in turn, our own health. The current review of these issues arose from a summer school in San Sebastian (Spain), from 5th-7th June, 2019. An interdisciplinary group of researchers discussed key risks (e.g. microbial pollution, pharmaceuticals, harmful algal blooms, plastic pollution) and benefits (e.g. bathing waters, recreation, tourism) of the seas and global ocean for humanity; and debated the future priorities and potential actions for a joint Oceans and Human Health research and governance programme in Europe. The aim of this review is to contribute to the emerging scientific agenda on ocean health and human health, as well as coordinate efforts with stakeholders, policy makers and the general public. This agenda operates within the larger context of the upcoming United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development: 2021-2030, which strives to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), including healthy (human) lives and well-being (SDG3) and conserving and sustainably using the oceans (SDG14), among others. In addition to summarising some of the key risks and benefits, therefore, we describe the governance of oceans and health interactions (especially in Europe), and we finish by proposing a list of elements for potential future research priorities on oceans and human health.},

	abstract = {Autonomous water sampling technologies may help to overcome the human resource challenges of monitoring biological threats to rivers over long time periods and across large geographic areas. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has pioneered a robotic Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) that overcomes some of the constraints associated with traditional sampling since it can automate water sample filtration and preservation of the captured material. The ESP was originally developed for marine environment applications. Here we evaluated whether the ESP can provide reliable, timely information on environmental (e)DNA detections of human and fish pathogens and introduced fishes at U.S. Geological Survey streamgage sites in freshwater rivers. We compared eDNA collected via ESP at high frequency (e.g., every 3 h) with manual eDNA collections collected at lower frequency (e.g., weekly). We found that water samples filtered and preserved by ESPs successfully detected the DNA of human pathogens, fish pathogens and introduced fishes. Both ESP and manually collected samples provided similar information about target DNA presence. We suggest that the greatest current benefit of the ESP is the cost savings of high frequency, bio-surveillance at remote or hard to access sites. The full potential of robotic technologies like the ESP will be realized when they can more easily execute in situ analyses of water samples and rapidly transmit results to decision-makers.},

To test the effect of predation risk continuity on changes in prey physiology, we exposed amphipods: Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus jazdzewskii to periodic and constant predation cue. After one week, we measured: cellular defence systems: total antioxidant status (TAS), heat shock proteins (Hsp70); intracellular damage marker: lipid peroxidation (TBARS); condition index: glycogen concentration. Predator presence reduced TAS level in G. jazdzewskii independent of its continuity and in D. villosus after periodic exposure. Amphipods showed downregulation of Hsp70 when exposed to periodic (D. villosus) or constant (G. jazdzewskii) predation risk. Exposure to predators reduced TBARS level in D. villosus (irrespective of the continuity) and G. jazdzewskii (periodic exposure). Glycogen concentration in both species was not affected by predator presence. Thus, the continuity of the predator cue shaped prey physiology reconfiguration, optimizing costs of physiological adjustments under challenging conditions. Nevertheless, the lack of negative consequences of the prolonged exposure to the predator cue, whether constant or periodic, shows that amphipods can thrive under chronic predation risk, which is a constant part of the wild environment.},

This review summarizes studies between 1999 and 2020 in relation to microplastics in aquatic ecosystems and human food products, their potential toxic effects as elicited in animal studies, and policies on their use and disposal. There is a paucity of information on the toxicity mechanisms of microplastics in animal studies, and despite their documented presence in food products, no policy has been in place so far, to monitor and regulates microplastics in commercial foods meant for human consumption. Although there are policies and regulations with respect to plastics, these are only in a few countries and in most instances are not fully implemented due to socioeconomic reasons, so they do not address the problem across the entire life cycle of plastics from production to disposal. More animal research to elucidate pathways and early biomarkers of microplastic toxicity that can easily be detected in humans is needed. This is to create awareness and influence policies that will address this neglected threat to food safety and security.},

After a general introduction to traceability and the initial applications of proteomics to authenticate traceability information, it addresses the application of proteomics to trace seafood exposure to some increasingly abundant emergent health hazards with the potential to indicate the geographic/environmental origin, such as microplastics, triclosan and human medicinal and recreational drugs. Thereafter, it shows the application of vibrational spectroscopy (Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Fourier-Transform Raman Spectroscopy (FT Raman)) and Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (LF-NMR) relaxometry to discriminate frozen fish from thawed fish and to estimate the time and temperature history of frozen fillets by monitoring protein modifications induced by processing and storage. The review concludes indicating near future trends in the application of these techniques to ensure seafood safety and traceability.},

	abstract = {The presence of a wide variety of emerging pollutants in natural water resources is an important global water quality challenge. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are known as emerging contaminants, widely used by modern society. This objective ensures availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, according to the 2030 Agenda. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) do not always mitigate the presence of these emerging contaminants in effluents discharged into the environment, although the removal efficiency of WWTP varies based on the techniques used. This main subject is framed within a broader environmental paradigm, such as the transition to a circular economy. The research and innovation within the WWTP will play a key role in improving the water resource management and its surrounding industrial and natural ecosystems. Even though bioremediation is a green technology, its integration into the bio-economy strategy, which improves the quality of the environment, is surprisingly rare if we compare to other corrective techniques (physical and chemical). This work carries out a bibliographic review, since the beginning of the 21st century, on the biological remediation of some PPCPs, focusing on organisms (or their by-products) used at the scale of laboratory or scale-up. PPCPs have been selected on the basics of their occurrence in water resources. The data reveal that, despite the advantages that are associated with bioremediation, it is not the first option in the case of the recovery of systems contaminated with PPCPs. The results also show that fungi and bacteria are the most frequently studied microorganisms, with the latter being more easily implanted in complex biotechnological systems (78\% of bacterial manuscripts vs. 40\% fungi). A total of 52 works has been published while using microalgae and only in 7\% of them, these organisms were used on a large scale. Special emphasis is made on the advantages that are provided by biotechnological systems in series, as well as on the need for eco-toxicological control that is associated with any process of recovery of contaminated systems.},

	abstract = {Most riverine mangroves (characterized by salinity fluctuations and tidal inundations), are seriously threatened by metallic pollution. Whether differences in salinity and tidal effects along the river continuum can affect metallic bioaccumulation and the biomagnification of species is still unknown. Bivalves are representative sessile inhabitants in mangrove ecosystems, with a high capacity to bioaccumulate metallic contaminants. The present study used two bivalves, Meretrix lusoria and Mytilopsis sallei, to monitor inter-site changes in metallic contamination and assess the associated ecological impacts along the tidal gradients of riverine mangroves. The concentrations of a total of six metals (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) in M. lusoria and M. sallei, collected at three different sites along Danshuei Riverine Mangrove, were investigated. The metallic concentrations of the whole soft body of the studied bivalves, and the associated surface sediment from each site, were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine the inter-site effects on the bioaccumulation and biomagnification of metallic contaminants in bivalves. There are increasing concentrations of four metallic contaminants, Zn, Cr, Cd and Cu, in the seaward direction of the bivalves. The increasing mean metallic concentrations along the seaward direction may be the effect of salinity, further decreasing the rate of the elimination of these metals, thus resulting in a net increase in metallic contaminants. Our results clearly show prominent inter-site changes in the metallic burdens of bivalves in our study on riverine mangrove ecosystems associated with different levels of bioaccumulation and biomagnification of metallic contaminants. Thus, it is important to monitor multiple sites along the dynamic environment of riverine mangroves in order to gain a good understanding of the ecological impact of metallic pollution risks. The present findings provide important evidence of the use of simple indices to assess the ecological impacts of metallic pollution in riverine mangroves.},

To test the effect of predation risk continuity on changes in prey physiology, we exposed amphipods: Dikerogammarus villosus and Gammarus jazdzewskii to periodic and constant predation cue. After one week, we measured: cellular defence systems: total antioxidant status (TAS), heat shock proteins (Hsp70); intracellular damage marker: lipid peroxidation (TBARS); condition index: glycogen concentration. Predator presence reduced TAS level in G. jazdzewskii independent of its continuity and in D. villosus after periodic exposure. Amphipods showed downregulation of Hsp70 when exposed to periodic (D. villosus) or constant (G. jazdzewskii) predation risk. Exposure to predators reduced TBARS level in D. villosus (irrespective of the continuity) and G. jazdzewskii (periodic exposure). Glycogen concentration in both species was not affected by predator presence. Thus, the continuity of the predator cue shaped prey physiology reconfiguration, optimizing costs of physiological adjustments under challenging conditions. Nevertheless, the lack of negative consequences of the prolonged exposure to the predator cue, whether constant or periodic, shows that amphipods can thrive under chronic predation risk, which is a constant part of the wild environment.},

	abstract = {Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) has attracted attention as an emerging dominant phthalate contaminant in marine sediments. Macrophthalmus japonicus, an intertidal mud crab, is capable of tolerating variations in water temperature and sudden exposure to toxic substances. To evaluate the potential effects of DEHP toxicity on cellular protection, we characterized the partial open reading frames of the stress-related heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) and small heat shock protein 67B2 (HSP67B2) genes of M. japonicus and further investigated the molecular effects on their expression levels after exposure to DEHP. Putative HSP60 and small HSP67B2 proteins had conserved HSP-family protein sequences with different C-terminus motifs. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that M. japonicus HSP60 (Mj-HSP60) and M. Japonicus HSP67B2 (Mj-HSP67B2) clustered closely with Eriocheir sinensis HSP60 and Penaeus vannamei HSP67B2, respectively. The tissue distribution of Heat shock proteins (HSPs) was the highest in the gonad for Mj-HSP60 and in the hepatopancreas for Mj-HSP67B2. The expression of Mj-HSP60 Messenger Ribonucleic Acid (mRNA) increased significantly at day 1 after exposure to all doses of DEHP, and then decreased in a dose-dependent and exposure time-dependent manner in the gills and hepatopancreas. Mj-HSP67B2 transcripts were significantly upregulated in both tissues at all doses of DEHP and at all exposure times. These results suggest that cellular immune protection could be disrupted by DEHP toxicity through transcriptional changes to HSPs in crustaceans. Small and large HSPs might be differentially involved in responses against environmental stressors and in detoxification in M. japonicus crabs.},

	abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic compounds that are widely distributed in the air, water, and soil. Recently, the amount of PAHs derived from fuels and from incomplete combustion processes is increasing. In the aquatic environment, oil spills directly cause PAH pollution and affect marine organisms. Oil spills correlate very well with the major shipping routes. Furthermore, accidental oil spills can seriously impact the marine environment toxicologically. Here, we describe PAH toxicities and related bioaccumulation properties in aquatic animals, including invertebrates. Recent studies have revealed the toxicity of PAHs, including endocrine disruption and tissue-specific toxicity, although researchers have mainly focused on the carcinogenic toxicity of PAHs. We summarize the toxicity of PAHs regarding these aspects. Additionally, the bioaccumulation properties of PAHs for organisms, including invertebrates, are important factors when considering PAH toxicity. In this review, we describe the bioaccumulation properties of PAHs in aquatic animals. Recently, microplastics have been the most concerning environmental problem in the aquatic ecosystem, and the vector effect of microplastics for lipophilic compounds is an emerging environmental issue. Here, we describe the correlation between PAHs and microplastics. Thus, we concluded that PAHs have a toxicity for aquatic animals, indicating that we should emphasize the prevention of aquatic PAH pollution.},

	abstract = {Autonomous water sampling technologies may help to overcome the human resource challenges of monitoring biological threats to rivers over long time periods and across large geographic areas. The Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute has pioneered a robotic Environmental Sample Processor (ESP) that overcomes some of the constraints associated with traditional sampling since it can automate water sample filtration and preservation of the captured material. The ESP was originally developed for marine environment applications. Here we evaluated whether the ESP can provide reliable, timely information on environmental (e)DNA detections of human and fish pathogens and introduced fishes at U.S. Geological Survey streamgage sites in freshwater rivers. We compared eDNA collected via ESP at high frequency (e.g., every 3 h) with manual eDNA collections collected at lower frequency (e.g., weekly). We found that water samples filtered and preserved by ESPs successfully detected the DNA of human pathogens, fish pathogens and introduced fishes. Both ESP and manually collected samples provided similar information about target DNA presence. We suggest that the greatest current benefit of the ESP is the cost savings of high frequency, bio-surveillance at remote or hard to access sites. The full potential of robotic technologies like the ESP will be realized when they can more easily execute in situ analyses of water samples and rapidly transmit results to decision-makers.},

Projections for the winter include drastically reduced ice and very weak water column stratification. In contrast, the summertime surface warming is projected to begin earlier, last longer, and be more enhanced. In concert, summertime biological production is projected to shift earlier and become larger. These changes have potentially important consequences for stakeholders with interests in shipping, coastal habitability, fishing, water quality, and recreation. Perhaps more fundamentally, the projected changes imply that Lake Superior may change into a different kind of lake with a dramatically weakened dimictic behavior.},

This review uses existing historical series (a few of which have been purposely updated) to assess extent and consequences of such changes. A number of warm-water species, previously absent or occasional in the comparatively cold Ligurian Sea, has recently established thanks to warmer winters. Occurrence among them of invasive alien species is causing concern because of their capacity of outcompeting autochthonous species. Summer heatwaves, on the other hand, caused mass mortalities in marine organisms, some of which found refuge at depth. New marine diseases appeared, as well as other dysfunctions such as the formation of mucilage aggregates that suffocated and entangled benthic organisms. Human pressures have combined with climate change to cause phase shifts (i.e., abrupt variations in species composition and community structure) in different habitats, such as the pelagic environment, seagrass meadows, rocky reefs, and marine caves. These phase shifts implied biotic homogenization, reduction of diversity, and dominance by invasive aliens, and may be detrimental to the resilience of Ligurian Sea ecosystems. Another phase of rapid warming has possibly started in the 2010s and there are clues pointing to a further series of biological changes, but data are too scarce to date for proper assessment. Only well addressed long-term studies will help understanding the future dynamics of Ligurian Sea ecosystems and their possibilities of recovery.},

	abstract = {Contamination status of coastal areas of Finland (northern Baltic Sea) markedly affected by anthropogenic activities (harbours, shipyards and maritime activity, industry, municipal and agricultural inputs, legacy contamination) was assessed for the first time using the weight of evidence (WOE) approach. The key element of the study was the caging (transplantation) of Baltic mussels (Mytilus trossulus) for the measurement of tissue accumulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and applying a suite of biomarkers of biological effects of contaminants. Additional variables included in the assessment were trace metals in seawater, macrozoobenthos, near-bottom oxygen levels and eutrophication indicators. The chemical parameters were supported by passive sampling of PAHs and organotins at the study sites. The integrated approach combining all the line of evidence (LOE) variables into the WOE showed separation of some sites as more affected by hazardous substances than others, with the most contaminated areas found around harbour and ship yard areas. The contaminant levels measured in the different matrices were not alarmingly high at none of the areas compared to many other areas within or outside the Baltic Sea under more heavy anthropogenic impact, rarely exceeding any given threshold values for Good Environmental Status of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. However, significant biological effects were recorded in mussels in the most contaminated sites, signifying that the combined effects caused by the contaminants and other environmental factors are disturbing the health of marine organisms in the area. The results of this successful combined application based on the mussel transplantation method and the WOE approach are highly encouraging for further trials in developing the monitoring of chemical contamination in the Baltic Sea.},

So far, examples of mussel-associated leech species are recorded from East Asia, Southeast Asia, India and Nepal, Africa, and North America. This group comprises a dozen glossiphoniid species with a hidden life style inside the mantle cavity of their hosts largely overlooked by researchers. We show that the association with freshwater mussels evolved independently in three leech clades, i.e. Batracobdelloides, Hemiclepsis, and Placobdella, at least since the Miocene. Seven mussel-associated leech species and two additional free-living taxa are described here as new to science.},

We analyse the histopathologic effects of a tar mixture used in mussel farms on the gonad of male mussels. Mussels were exposed to water-accommodated fractions from different sub-lethal concentrations of that tar mixture during different times. The accumulation of PAHs and metals in mussels was quantified in each one tar exposure condition, and a comparative histological and morphometric analysis of the male gonad was performed, as well as of the gametogenic disorders and the cellular pathologies induced. Spermatogenesis disruption and alterations of somatic and germinal cells were observed as a direct effect of treatment. The pathologies observed followed an increasing malignity sequence depending on dose and exposure time: spawning induction; arrest of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis; suppression of immune response; dysplasia of Sertoli and connective cells and finally, severe disorders of germinal cells. We demonstrate for the first time that tar used in waterproofing of floating rafts from the mussel farms causes severe effects on male mussel gonad, constituting a direct risk to the health of these organisms, affecting gametogenesis, quality of gametes and, ultimately, the sustainability of this resource and their quality for human consumption. Moreover, we propose the pathologies described in mussel as biomarkers of marine pollution and the mussel gonad as study model of testicular toxicity mechanisms in male reproduction.},

The molecular level stress response mechanism operating in this organism in environmental stress conditions was investigated. De novo assembly of the O. reevesii transcriptome yielded 51,007 unigenes, of which 14,774 were annotated. Time-series expression analyses resulted in clustering of most responsive transcripts into 16 statistically significant expression profiles. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis based on time-series expression identified metal ion binding, synaptic transmission, and oxidative stress as important biological processes, and expression analysis identified genes related to invertebrate responses to environmental stress. Furthermore, we have generated the first transcriptome of O. reevesii, and the extensive sequence data produced will provide valuable molecular resources for study of the response of O. reevesii to cadmium exposure.},

Formed mainly by algae and cyanobacteria, they produce the degradation of the colonized substrates and decrease the show value of the caves. This phenomenon became famous worldwide in the 1960s due to the damage caused to the paintings in the Lascaux Cave (France). Since then it has become an issue of serious concern to both managers of show caves and to the international scientific community. Over time, the problem has been approached following two complementary strategies: preventing colonization by the invading organisms or eliminating them once they have become established through the use of chemical products, mainly biocides and strong oxidants. This kind of treatment generates pollutant effluents that can move the problem from the walls of the caves to the groundwater. This paper presents a critical literature review of the problem and the proposed solutions, and emphasizes the need for further study of the optimal doses of treatment chemicals and to develop quantitative methods to determine their effectiveness.},

Moving from vague, emotional reactions about mussel restoration to more rigorous discussions and analyses can help focus efforts to where they do the most good. We suggest that: (i) projects to restore mussels for conservation goals to sites where known environmental problems have been eliminated or mitigated have good prospects for success; (ii) projects to restore mussels for conservation goals to sites where known environmental problems have not been eliminated or mitigated have poor prospects for success; (iii) projects to restore mussels for conservation goals to sites in the common situation in which the status of environmental problems is unknown have unknown prospects for success, but may be valuable as scientific experiments, if project performance is monitored properly; (iv) the value of population augmentation as a conservation tool is uncertain, and needs better theoretical and empirical analysis; (v) assisted migration of mussels as a conservation tool is controversial, and should be discussed thoroughly before we reach crises in which it is rejected or carried out carelessly; (vi) projects to restore ecosystem services face more stringent criteria for success than conservation projects, and some such projects being discussed seem unlikely to succeed. Monitoring data on how restoration projects perform typically are inadequately collected, reported, disseminated, and used to improve practice. This could be improved by setting up a clearinghouse to collect, hold, and disseminate data; providing training to restorationists; and opening conversations between restorationists and data managers and statisticians.},

	abstract = {The Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum has become a common and dominant macrobenthic species in coastal areas of the northwestern Pacific and temperate waters of Europe; it is also a major cultured shellfish, with annual worldwide production exceeding 3.3 million tonnes. This species faces greater risk of exposure to hypoxia as eutrophication worsens throughout its coastal habitats; however, its tolerance to hypoxia remains unclear, and the toxicological indicators including LC50 and LT50 have not yet been assessed. Previous studies on the effects of hypoxia on marine benthos have focused largely on functional responses, such as metabolism and gene expression, leaving potential structural damage to the mitochondria or the cells unknown. In this study we assessed the effects of hypoxia on Manila clam in terms of survival, behavior, metabolism and cellular damage, using a newly designed automated hypoxia simulation device that features exceptional accuracy and good stability. The clams exhibited strong tolerance to hypoxia as the 20-day LC50 for dissolved oxygen (DO) was estimated to be 0.57 mg L-1, and the LT50 at 0.5 mg L-1 DO was 422 hours. Adaptations included fewer buried clams and a depressed metabolism, while the unexpected rise in the activities of key enzymes involved in glycolysis may indicate a diverse strategy of shellfish under hypoxia. Cellular damage was observed as collapse of the mitochondrial cristae and both cellular and mitochondrial vacuolization. This multi-level study complements and updates our knowledge of the effects of hypoxia on marine benthos, by improving our understanding of the potential for marine ecological transformation under hypoxic conditions and providing useful information for Manila clam farming.},

	abstract = {Marine plastic pollution is now considered a diverse contaminant suite, differing in product origin, polymer composition, size, morphology, colour, additives and environmental cocontaminants. The environmental hazards associated with marine plastic pollution have been widely documented, however much of the existing research has yet to document developmental abnormalities observed when biota develop in plastic contaminated systems. The effect of microplastic leachate exposure on two marine echinoderms early developmental stages were investigated. Psammechinus milaris and Paracentrotus lividus embryonic and larval cultures were exposed to leachates derived from industrial or environmental exposed plastic pellets to investigate the effect of polymer additives and environmental contaminants. Toxicity was evaluated morphologically using images of live embryos and larvae, along with immunostaining of key developmental tissue groups to determine the extent of impact on a physiological level. This body of work suggests that leachates from pellets exposed to environmental contaminates (biobead and pre-production nurdle pellets) and highly plasticised industrial pellets (polyvinyl chloride) elicit severe, consistent and treatment-specific phenotypes in P. lividus embryonic and larval developmental stages, with impacts on morphogenic processes. Key differences in larvae morphology were documented between plastic types and environmental exposure. Industrial polyvinyl chloride pellets elicited the most pronounced abnormalities from the wild type at 24 hours post-fertilisation. However, leachates from un-plasticised industrial polyethylene pellets showed little differences from the wildtype with regards to developmental timing and abnormalities. Leachates from environmental sourced pellets elicited the most severe developmental delays and abnormalities at 48 hours post-fertilisation. Preliminary chemical analysis was also performed on industrial and beached pellet leachates, to investigate compound composition and to determine possible contributors to the developmental defects. To summarise, the findings suggest industrial and environmental microplastic leachate exposure elicits morphological malformations and specific abnormalities in neural, cilia and muscle tissues groups in both embryonic and larval stages of marine larvae of P. lividus. However, more research and investigation are needed to draw conclusive data.},

The collective aim of this work is to provide a scalable foundation upon which an application like Visipedia can be built. We conduct experiments using two highly motivated communities, the birding community and the naturalist community, and report results and lessons on how to build the necessary components of a Visipedia. First, we conduct experiments analyzing the behavior of state-of-the-art computer vision classifiers on long tailed datasets. We find poor feature sharing between classes, potentially limiting the applicability of these models and emphasizing the ability to intelligently direct data collection resources. Second, we devise online crowdsourcing algorithms to make dataset collection for binary labels, multiclass labels, keypoints, and mulit-instance bounding boxes faster, cheaper, and more accurate. These methods jointly estimate labels, worker skills, and train computer vision models for these tasks. Experiments show that we can achieve significant cost savings compared to traditional data collection techniques, and that we can produce a more accurate dataset compared to traditional data collection techniques. Third, we present two fine-grained datasets, detail how they were constructed, and analyze the test accuracy of state-of-the-art methods. These datasets are then used to create applications that help users identify species in their photographs: Merlin, an app assisting users in identifying birds species, and iNaturalist, an app that assists users in identifying a broad variety of species. Finally, we present work aimed at reducing the computational burden of large scale classification with the goal of creating an application that allows users to classify tens of thousands of species in real time on their mobile device. As a whole, the lessons learned and the techniques presented in this thesis bring us closer to the realization of a Visipedia.},

	abstract = {Crayfish are among the largest aquatic macroinvertebrates in rivers and streams. Their trophic ecology is important for the understanding of the functioning of benthic communities. This is relevant in key areas, such as headwaters, as they partly condition the processes occurring downstream. To shed light on the effects of native white-clawed crayfish, Austropotamobius pallipes, on local macroinvertebrate assemblages from running headwaters, a three-month mesocosm-based field study was designed. Collection and subsequent analysis of benthic samples under different crayfish density levels yielded a set of metrics indicative of short-term impacts at general and taxonomic scales. Neither significant positive nor negative effects on the community were evident in terms of richness, diversity, dominance and biomass. A combination of highly patched distributions of macroinvertebrates along with a weak impact of crayfish foraging activity is considered to explain this lack of effects. Only temporal changes associated with particular biological cycles appeared for some of the main taxa. Based on the results, we are not able to determine whether the white-clawed crayfish perceptibly disturbs the structure and composition of the local macroinvertebrate assemblages in the short-term. Thus, its use in future restocking projects is supported.Alternate abstract: Les écrevisses sont parmi les plus gros macroinvertébrés aquatiques dans les rivières et les ruisseaux. Leur écologie trophique est importante pour la compréhension du fonctionnement des communautés benthiques. C'est pertinent dans des domaines clés, tels que les eaux d'amont, car elles conditionnent en partie les processus qui se produisent en aval. Pour faire la lumière sur les effets de l'écrevisse à pieds blancs, Austropotamobius pallipes, sur les assemblages de macroinvertébrés locaux des eaux d'amont, une étude de trois mois en mésocosme sur le terrain a été conçue. Collecte et analyse d'échantillons benthiques selon les niveaux de densité différentes en écrevisses ont donné un ensemble de paramètres indicatifs des impacts à court terme à l'échelle générale et taxonomique. Aucun effet positif ou négatif important sur la communauté n'était évident en termes de richesse, de diversité, de dominance et de biomasse. On considère que cette absence d'effets s'explique par la combinaison d'une distribution de macroinvertébrés très hétérogène et d'un faible impact de l'activité de recherche de nourriture des écrevisses. Seuls des changements temporels associés à des cycles biologiques particuliers sont apparus pour certains des principaux taxons. D'après les résultats, nous ne sommes pas en mesure de déterminer si l'écrevisse à pattes blanches perturbe à court terme de façon perceptible la structure et la composition des assemblages locaux de macroinvertébrés. Ainsi, son utilisation dans les futurs projets de repeuplement est confortée.},

	abstract = {Submerged macrophytes and periphyton are benthic primary producers that play an important role for several ecosystem functions of lakes. Their growth often depends on the availability of phosphorus (P) in sediments and overlying water. This P availability is assumed to potentially be affected by induced bank filtration (IBF), a cost-effective method for drinking water production. In this study, we tested whether littoral sediments sampled at sites with high and low influence of IBF in a temperate eutrophic lake used for bank filtration since more than 100 years affects periphyton and macrophyte growth. Sediments differed in aerobic desorbed water-soluble phosphorus (PH2O) and iron (Fe) content and the growth of macrophytes in sediments with a high impact of IBF was lower compared to sediments with low impact of IBF. We also found that P addition to the nutrient solution increased periphyton growth and that periphyton limited macrophyte growth. While these results point to a potential impact of IBF on P availability in sediments that can cascade to benthic primary producers, we could not prove mechanistic links between high rates of IBF and the lower macrophyte growth. Additional research to assure a sustainable application of this valuable drinking water production method is therefore needed.},

	abstract = {While oceans are vast, they represent a fragile resource that must be protected if we want to protect our livelihoods and our planet. Marine pollution has been a topic of concern for a long time, and it has recently attracted the attention of scientists, environmentalists, economists, politicians and journalists in mainstream media, . Besides providing food, transportation routes and other resources, the oceans serve as a heat absorbing sink which offsets the extreme heating effects of climate change, but only to a limited degree. Pollution in marine environments such as the oceans, poses a threat to coastal communities by affecting the fauna and flora in the environment and the health of the nearby population. This has a disruptive effect on the health and economy of these communities. Marine Pollution: Current Status, Impacts and Remedies emphasizes the limitations of marine resources that relevant environments provide. Readers will find chapters on methods to assess pollution as well as important information for identifying, measuring, and remediating various pollutants. The book also covers some known pollutants (heavy metals, organic pollutants, microplastics) and ways to manage these substances. Other issues covered in the book include problems caused by invasive species, and the ecological problems caused by pollutants which affect local fauna and flora. This book will prove to be a useful resource for students, researchers, and policymakers, who are working in environmental science, marine conservation and allied fields.},

	abstract = {Cybercriminals threaten strategic and efficient use of the Internet within the business environment. Each year, cybercrimes in the United States cost business leaders approximately \$6 billion, and globally, \$445 billion. The purpose of this multiple case study was to explore the operational strategies chief information security officers of high-technology companies used to protect their businesses from cyberattacks. Organizational learning theory was the conceptual framework for the study. The population of the study was 3 high-technology business owners operating in Florida who have Internet expertise and successfully protected their businesses from cyberattacks. Member checking and methodological triangulation were used to valid the data gathered through semistructured interviews, a review of company websites, and social media pages. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, which supported the identification of 4 themes: effective leadership, cybersecurity awareness, reliance on third-party vendors, and cybersecurity training. The implications of this study for positive social change include a safe and secure environment for conducting electronic transactions, which may result in increased business and consumer confidence strengthened by the protection of personal and confidential information. The creation and sustainability of a safe Internet environment may lead to increased usage and trust in online business activities, leading to greater online business through consumer confidence and communication.},

	doi = {10.4081/jlimnol.2018.1760},
	abstract = {Recently, the use of Daphnia magna has been proposed in on-line and real-time biomonitoring programmes as an early warning system for evaluating the effluent quality of sewage treatment plants (STPs). These systems are based on recording behavioural changes in the test organism resulting from the stress caused by the effluents. Indeed, altered behavioural signals could be induced at sublethal concentrations that are significantly lower than the corresponding EC50. However, at present, it is unknown whether the sensitivity of D. magna can be representative of that of other aquatic organisms, particularly benthic macroinvertebrates. An experiment was designed to verify whether D. magna can be employed in biomonitoring programmes for STPs located in alpine areas as a surrogate for cold freshwater best-adapted species. The responses of survival and behaviour alteration to exposure to the effluent of the Tonale Pass plant (Trentino, Italian Alps, 46°N, 10°E; 1799 m a.s.l.) were compared in a laboratory population of D. magna and a wild population of the chironomid Diamesa cinerella. These larvae were collected from the Vermigliana stream 50 metres upstream of the effluent input. Both organisms were exposed for 24 and 48 hrs to the effluent as it is and to three dilutions (/10, /100, /1000). The mortality rate and behavioural responses (using video tracking systems) were recorded. No significant mortality or change in behaviour was observed in the two species when exposed to the undiluted effluent. Exposure to serial dilutions of the treated effluent did not affect the survival of either species but notably altered their behaviour at both exposure times (e.g., the time spent in activity in D. magna and the average speed of movement and the cumulative distance travelled in both), especially when exposed to the ten-times-diluted effluent. Overall, the findings of this study emphasize that even though D. magna and D. cinerella use different behavioural strategies to cope with adverse environmental conditions, their overall sensitivity to treated effluents is similar. Accordingly, the use of D. magna in biological early warning systems protocols seems to also be sufficiently protective for local, cold-adapted species of alpine freshwater ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Surveying multiple invasive pest species at the same time can help reduce the cost of detecting new pest invasions. In this paper, we describe a new method for mapping the relative likelihood of pest invasion via plant propagation material in a geographic setting. The method simulates the invasion of a range of pest species, including arrival in an uninvaded area, spread, and survival in a novel landscape, using information on the spatial and temporal distribution of the suitable host crop species and tentative knowledge of the spread and survival capacities of the target pests. The methodology is applied to a gridded map in which each map cell represents a site in a landscape. The method uses stochastic simulations to depict plausible realizations of the invasion outcomes and estimate the distribution of pest invasion likelihood for each cell in the area of concern. The method then prioritizes the cells based on the stochastic invasion outcomes using a pairwise stochastic dominance rule and a hypervolume indicator. We demonstrate the approach by assessing the relative likelihood of pest invasion for strawberry production in Finland. Our method helps to differentiate sites in a landscape using both the estimates of pest invasion risk and their uncertainty. It can be applied to prioritize sites for plant health surveys and allocate survey resources among large geographic regions. The approach is generalizable and can be used in situations where knowledge of the harmful pest species is poor or nonexistent.},

	abstract = {IntroductionConstruction activities in and along urban streams increase the sediment input into surface waters, causing an overall decline in water quality and aquatic ecosystems. In this case study, we investigate the water quality impacts of local hydromodification in an urban stream (discharge 0.4 m3/s). At the site of interest, workers removed a stream crossing consisting of an embankment with culverts and replaced it with a small bridge (single span of 25 m) in an effort to improve flow capacity.MethodsWater samples were taken at four sites along the North Branch Park River in Connecticut, Northeastern United States. Turbidity and dissolved oxygen (DO) were measured in situ, and nitrate and total phosphorus (TP) were measured in the laboratory. Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were also collected and analyzed for taxon richness and Shannon-Weaver species diversity. Data were compared between upstream and downstream sites and before, during, and after hydromodification. We used one-way ANOVA combined with the post hoc Turkey test to derive statistical significance.ResultsDuring construction, turbidity increased temporarily by 60.9\% [from 2.48 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) over ambient to 4.00 NTU]. Once construction was completed, DO increased locally from 11.0 to 13.0 mg/L. Benthic macroinvertebrate taxon richness and species diversity declined by 61.6 and 32.6\% respectively, with no recovery observed in the year following construction. Water quality was only affected within 50 m downstream. Nitrate and TP concentrations were unaffected.ConclusionsSmall-scale hydromodification temporarily increased the turbidity as a result of increased sediment input, approaching the maximum level for clean water (5 NTU). Benthic macroinvertebrate communities declined in the immediate downstream vicinity of construction but are expected to recover soon given that turbidity recovered to pre-construction levels, and DO increased. These outcomes emphasize that environmental assessment is important not only for large-scale hydromodification but also for smaller scale stream modifications.},

It is still under discussion if microplastics are relevant pollutant vectors for uptake into aquatic organisms in comparison to further uptake pathways, e.g., via water or sediment particles. We analyzed how the presence of microplastics (polyamide particles, PA) modifies acute effects of the environmental pollutant bisphenol A (BPA) on freshwater zooplankton (Daphnia magna). Daphnids were exposed to PA particles and BPA alone, before combining them in the next step with one concentration of PA and varying concentrations of BPA. The PA particles themselves did not induce negative effects, while the effects of BPA alone followed a typical dose-dependent manner. Sorption of BPA to PA particles prior to exposure led to a reduction of BPA in the aqueous phase. The combination of BPA and PA led to decreased immobilization, although PA particles loaded with BPA were ingested by the daphnids. Calculations based on physiochemistry and equilibrium assumptions indicated lower BPA body burden of daphnids in the presence of PA particles. These results confirm model-based studies, and show that investigated microplastic concentrations are negligible for the overall pollutant uptake of daphnids with water as additional uptake pathway.},

As filter feeders, oysters ingest bacteria along with phytoplankton from their surrounding habitats. Ensuring seafood safety for human consumption is always a concern. Since oysters are consumed raw, disease causing organisms, environmental contaminants, toxins, chemicals, and even physical hazards such as soils and metals retained in the oysters can enter through feeding. The objective of this study was to determine the quality of oysters collected from Delaware Inland Bays (DIB) and compare them with market oysters. Environmental parameters were monitored from local waters of DIB classified as closed versus open for shellfish harvesting. Total aerobic bacteria and vibrio were higher in market oysters during the warmer months, with open water having the least microbial loads. There were no significant differences in total vibrio counts between the study sites (p=0.396), but significant differences were recorded over time (p=0.004). Water temperature and turbidity were directly proportional to total vibrio in oysters, and salinity was inversely related. Research findings in this study may help bring awareness of changes in bacterial loads due to seasonal changes and additional handling and storage.},

Therefore, any new farming initiative needs deep knowledge on reproductive cycle of native mussel populations. The reproductive cycle of Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. from five sites, three estuarine and two coastal, along the coast of the Basque Country were assessed using gonad index and stereology over 2 consecutive years (2010 and 2011). Sex ratios, developmental stages of gonads , as well as reserve tissue cycle were analyzed. The onset of gametogenesis was observed from winter to spring, with spawning occurring from spring till summer. A resting phase followed with an increase in reserve tissues (adipogranular cells) was observed in fall. Mussels stayed ripe during winter until favorable environmental conditions were met in spring. Differences in reproductive cycles were found among populations, and also, year-to-year variability was observed within each population. In two of the studied sites asynchrony in the timing of spawning was observed between genders. These timing differences, however, did not prevent mussels at those sites from reproducing successfully. The Bidasoa estuary points to the potential of such studied sites for becoming the main source of wild mussel spats for future expected commercial mussel farming in the Basque Country. To ensure year-to-year maximum reproductive output, however, wild mussels harvest should be avoided from spring to the end of summer in this region.},

	abstract = {Mussel commercial production depends on wild populations to obtain the seed. Therefore, any new farming initiative needs deep knowledge on reproductive cycle of native mussel populations. The reproductive cycle of Mytilus galloprovincialis Lmk. from five sites, three estuarine and two coastal, along the coast of the Basque Country were assessed using gonad index and stereology over 2 consecutive years (2010 and 2011). Sex ratios, developmental stages of gonads, as well as reserve tissue cycle were analyzed. The onset of gametogenesis was observed from winter to spring, with spawning occurring from spring till summer. A resting phase followed with an increase in reserve tissues (adipogranular cells) was observed in fall. Mussels stayed ripe during winter until favorable environmental conditions were met in spring. Differences in reproductive cycles were found among populations, and also, year-to-year variability was observed within each population. In two of the studied sites asynchrony in the timing of spawning was observed between genders. These timing differences, however, did not prevent mussels at those sites from reproducing successfully. The Bidasoa estuary points to the potential of such studied sites for becoming the main source of wild mussel spats for future expected commercial mussel farming in the Basque Country. To ensure year-to-year maximum reproductive output, however, wild mussels harvest should be avoided from spring to the end of summer in this region.},

	abstract = {Interest in the field of environmental DNA (eDNA) is growing rapidly and eDNA surveys are becoming an important consideration for aquatic resource managers dealing with invasive species. However, in order for eDNA monitoring to mature as a research and management tool, there are several critical knowledge gaps that must be filled. One such gap is the fate of eDNA materials in the aquatic environment. Understanding the environmental factors that influence the decay of eDNA and how these factors impact detection probabilities over time and space could have significant implications for eDNA survey design and data interpretation. Here we experimentally explore decay of eDNA associated with bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) biological waste collected from an aquaculture filtration system and with sperm collected from captive silver carp (H. molitrix), and how decay may be influenced by differing levels of water turbulence, temperature, microbial load, and pH. We found that the decay patterns of eDNA associated with both H. nobilis biological waste and H. molitrix milt significantly fit monophasic exponential decay curves. Secondly, we observed that the highest temperature we tested resulted in a decay half-life as much as 5.5× more rapid than the lowest temperature we tested. When we suppressed microbial loads in eDNA samples, we observed that overall losses of eDNA were reduced by about 2.5×. When we amended eDNA samples with pond water the half-life of eDNA was reduced by about 2.25×, despite relatively little apparent increase in the overall microbial load. This pattern indicated that species constituency of the microbial community, in addition to microbial load, might play a critical role in eDNA degradation. A shift in pH from 6.5 to 8.0 in the samples resulted in a 1.6× reduction in eDNA half-life. Water turbulence in our study had no apparent effect on eDNA decay. When we combined different temperature, pH, and microbial load treatments to create a rapid decay condition and a slow decay condition, and tracked eDNA decay over 91 days, we observed a 5.0× greater loss of eDNA by Day 5 under rapid decay conditions than under slow decay conditions. At the end of the trials, the differences in eDNA loss between the rapid decay and baseline and slow decay conditions were 0.1× and 3.3×, respectively. Our results strongly demonstrate the potential for environmental factors to influence eDNA fate and, thus, the interpretation of eDNA survey results.},

	abstract = {This volume is an account of the scientific and social responses made to the discovery of an invasive forest insect -- the emerald ash borer or EAB (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire, 1888) -- in North America, that was formally announced in July 2002. Since its recognition, this wood-boring beetle has become one of the most destructive and costly exotic species ever encountered. More than \$300 million in federal USDA-APHIS funds (alone) have been devoted to battling this pest, which has killed some tens of millions of ash trees, chiefly within southeastern Michigan and surrounding states. EAB has now been found in 28 states and two Canadian provinces. But those numbers are almost certain to keep growing in coming years.While primarily a case study, this work nonetheless examines larger issues concerning invasive species as a whole, their inadvertent transport and worldwide spread through the rise of globalization, regulations that have been adopted to prevent their introduction, and the successes or failures of state and federal agencies to try and enforce those regulations. It offers the first general work of its kind to appear on the ash borer that is directed towards a broad audience including the public, entomologists and foresters, environmentalists and ecologists, researchers, regulators, and indeed anyone who wishes to learn more about this important and timely topic. No previous knowledge of EAB or invasion biology is assumed.This book covers all of the major aspects of scientific research and management that have occurred since EAB was recognized in 2002. It is thoroughly researched and draws from the best available data and sources, which represent (a) archival materials; (b) scholarly publications and conference proceedings; (c) interviews conducted with leading participants in the EAB program; (d) selected newspaper/magazine articles; and (e) reputable sources found on the Internet (e.g., USDA-APHIS).},

Using an adaptive management experiment, we tested the hypothesis that reducing moose to historic levels would reduce apparent competition and therefor recover caribou populations. Nested within this broad hypothesis were three specific hypotheses: (1) sport hunting could be used to substantially reduce moose numbers to an ecological target; (2) wolves in this ecosystem were primarily limited by moose abundance; and (3) caribou were limited by wolf predation. These hypotheses were evaluated with a before-after control-impact (BACI) design that included response metrics such as population trends and vital rates of caribou, moose, and wolves. Three caribou subpopulations were subject to the moose reduction treatment and two were in a reference area where moose were not reduced. When the moose harvest was increased, the moose population declined substantially in the treatment area (by 70\%) but not the reference area, suggesting that the policy had the desired effect and was not caused by a broader climatic process. Wolf numbers subsequently declined in the treatment area, with wolf dispersal rates 2.5× greater, meaning that dispersal was the likely mechanism behind the wolf numerical response, though reduced recruitment and starvation was also documented in the treatment area. Caribou adult survival increased from 0.78 to 0.88 in the treatment area, but declined in the reference. Caribou recruitment was unaffected by the treatment. The largest caribou subpopulation stabilized in the treatment area, but declined in the reference area. The observed population stability is comparable to other studies that used intensive wolf control, but is insufficient to achieve recovery, suggesting that multiple limiting factors and corresponding management tools must be addressed simultaneously to achieve population growth.},

When introduced into the wild, they prey on native fish, compete for food, impact habitat through their spawning events, and can cause disturbance and water turbidity.

How do I apply for the draw or get a Saskatchewan resident hunting licence?

[...]you obtain a Saskatchewan Health Card, you cannot get a license on the online HAL system.

	abstract = {Mollusks record valuable information in their hard parts that reflect ambient environmental conditions. For this reason, shells can serve as excellent archives to reconstruct past climate and environmental variability. However, animal physiology and biomineralization, which are often poorly understood, can make the decoding of environmental signals a challenging task. Many of the routinely used shell-based proxies are sensitive to multiple different environmental and physiological variables. Therefore, the identification and interpretation of individual environmental signals (e.g., water temperature) often is particularly difficult. Additional proxies not influenced by multiple environmental variables or animal physiology would be a great asset in the field of paleoclimatology. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential use of structural properties of Arctica islandica shells as an environmental proxy. A total of 11 specimens were analyzed to study if changes of the microstructural organization of this marine bivalve are related to environmental conditions. In order to limit the interference of multiple parameters, the samples were cultured under controlled conditions. Three specimens presented here were grown at two different water temperatures (10 and 15°C) for multiple weeks and exposed only to ambient food conditions. An additional eight specimens were reared under three different dietary regimes. Shell material was analyzed with two techniques; (1) confocal Raman microscopy (CRM) was used to quantify changes of the orientation of microstructural units and pigment distribution, and (2) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to detect changes in microstructural organization. Our results indicate that A. islandica microstructure is not sensitive to changes in the food source and, likely, shell pigment are not altered by diet. However, seawater temperature had a statistically significant effect on the orientation of the biomineral. Although additional work is required, the results presented here suggest that the crystallographic orientation of biomineral units of A. islandica may serve as an alternative and independent proxy for seawater temperature.},

Using only filter-feeding fish for algal suppression and water quality control was more effective in the short-term, but use of both filter-feeding fish and piscivorous fish was better in the long-term. Obvious suppression of phytoplankton biomass (PB) only occurred during the first 14 days regardless of the fish stocked. Adding fish to the enclosure clearly alters phytoplankton community structure and introducing piscivorous fish to an enclosure stocked with filter-feeding fish changed the relative densities of dominant algae species. While stocking filter-feeding fish decreased total nitrogen concentration by removing phytoplankton, it did not effectively decrease total phosphorus and Chlorophyll a concentrations. Introducing piscivorous fish to the enclosure weakened the relationship between nutrients and phytoplankton. Results indicate that stocking only filter-feeding fish to improve water quality and suppress phytoplankton in an impoundment area is insufficient and other technologies and means should be applied simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EEDCs) are environmental contaminants that can alter hormone signalling in both humans and wildlife, exerting their action through estrogen receptors (ERs). A wealth of evidence has indicated that EEDCs are capable of producing a broad range of adverse outcomes by interacting with, and disrupting, the normal functioning of the estrogen system. Fish are particularly vulnerable to endocrine disruption due to EEDCs being frequently discharged into waterways. With more than 900 chemicals identified as being endocrine disruptors, of which {\textasciitilde}200 may exert estrogenic effects, there is an urgent need for screening processes that can assess the estrogenic potential of chemicals in order to avoid human and environmental health risks. In vivo models capable of demonstrating the physiological effects of EEDCs hold great utility for understanding the potential health impacts of estrogens, and transgenic (TG) zebrafish (Danio rerio) models are particularly well-suited for the screening of EEDCs via bioimaging approaches. The pigment-free estrogen-responsive ERE:GFP:Casper model represents a promising transgenic line for qualifying and quantifying EEDC-induced fluorescence responses in larval fish and is amenable to high-throughput screening (HTS). We optimised a medium-throughput semi-automated in vivo bioimaging assay using the model, while simultaneously generating important data concerning estrogen-driven responses to an EEDC (EE2). Through refinement of assay parameters, including the use of various image-masking and pixel-thresholding approaches, controlled-breeding to reduce genetic variability and standardised larval orientation for image acquisition, we established the most sensitive and robust approaches for screening of the EE2-exposed model using a semi-automated imaging modality. Our optimised assay was capable of detecting a significant GFP response in 4 day old zebrafish larvae at an environmentally relevant (5ng/L) concentration of EE2. These specifications were then adopted for investigating the influence of varying incubation temperatures (24, 28 and 32°C) on EE2-exposed ERE:GFP:Casper larval growth and GFP responses. This analysis provided information concerning the potential for an EEDC to interact with temperature in a fish model, with important implications for subsequent interpretation of results. We screened the same animal over a series of timepoints generating valuable data concerning estrogen-induced fluorescence responses and specific larval growth. Incubation temperature was found to have a significant effect on GFP induction, both alone and in interaction with EE2. The findings of this thesis help to outline an improved approach for further development of higher-throughput in vivo estrogenic screening of a transgenic zebrafish model.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12864-017-4012-z},
	abstract = {Background 
Mytilisepta virgata is a marine mussel commonly found along the coasts of Japan. Although this species has been the subject of occasional studies concerning its ecological role, growth and reproduction, it has been so far almost completely neglected from a genetic and molecular point of view. In the present study we present a high quality de novo assembled transcriptome of the Japanese purplish mussel, which represents the first publicly available collection of expressed sequences for this species.
Results
The assembled transcriptome comprises almost 50,000 contigs, with a N50 statistics of {\textasciitilde}1 kilobase and a high estimated completeness based on the rate of BUSCOs identified, standing as one of the most exhaustive sequence resources available for mytiloid bivalves to date. Overall this data, accompanied by gene expression profiles from gills, digestive gland, mantle rim, foot and posterior adductor muscle, presents an accurate snapshot of the great functional specialization of these five tissues in adult mussels.
Conclusions
We highlight that one of the most striking features of the M. virgata transcriptome is the high abundance and diversification of lectin-like transcripts, which pertain to different gene families and appear to be expressed in particular in the digestive gland and in the gills. Therefore, these two tissues might be selected as preferential targets for the isolation of molecules with interesting carbohydrate-binding properties.
In addition, by molecular phylogenomics, we provide solid evidence in support of the classification of M. virgata within the Brachidontinae subfamily. This result is in agreement with the previously proposed hypothesis that the morphological features traditionally used to group Mytilisepta spp. and Septifer spp. within the same clade are inappropriate due to homoplasy.},

Methods: Samplings were performed quarterly, from February to December 2014, in 10 transects along to the Paraná River main channel. For each sample site, 100 L of water were filtered. The filtrated was fixed in alcohol 80\%, and the larval stages were counted and classified under the optical microscope. Concomitant to biological collections we took some of the main water variables. We performed a Redundancy Analysis (RDA) in order to summarize the variations in densities of larval stages in relation to the main physical and chemical water variables. Results: We found a total of200,590 L. fortunei larvae, in which 83.6\% were identified as the initial stages. The most abundant months in L. fortunei larvae were December and February. The first two axes of RDA sum up 96\% of the total data variation, and the most significant environmental variables explaining variations in larval densities were: water temperature, total nitrogen, electrical conductivity, phosphate, dissolved oxygen, depth and ammoniac ion. The warmer months were influenced by the major values of water temperature and depth, besides the higher densities of all larval stages. Conclusions: Our results indicate that L. fortunei reproduction follows a general pattern throughout the upper Paraná River floodplain, what seems to occur mainly between February and December. Thus, we suggest that measures for the L. fortunei control should be done during low-density periods (i.e., April to August), when the water level is low, and consequently, the dispersion of this species might be limited.Alternate abstract:Objetivo: Verificar a dinámica temporal dos estágios larvais de Limnoperna fortunei, e identificar as variáveis ambientais direcionadoras desses padröes, em uma área altamente impactada pela construçâo de reservatórios.

As densidades mais elevadas de larvas de L. fotunei foram os meses de dezembro e fevereiro. Os dois primeiros eixos da RDA sumarizaram 96\% da variaçâo total dos dados, e as variáveis ambientais significativas para explicar as variaçöes nas densidades larvais foram: temperatura da água, nitrogenio total, condutividade elétrica, fosfato, oxigenio dissolvido, profundidade, e íon amonio. Os meses quentes foram influenciados pela temperatura e profundidade, juntamente com as maiores densidades dos estágios larvais. Conclusoes: Nossos resultados indicam que a reproduçâo segue um padrâo geral ao longo de toda a planície, acontecendo principalmente nos meses de fevereiro e dezembro.

	abstract = {The presented system of experimental trays permits conducting field experiments at considerable depths, all year round, and with no application of diving techniques. The deployed set can be entirely hidden under water, which is an advantage in crowded areas. The set is composed of single units, each composed of a tray filled with a substrate, four-legged bridles, and a hanging rope with a removable marker float fixed on top by means of a carabiner clip. The float provides information on the location of deployed trays, and permits proper distribution of next trays to be deployed. After deployment from a boat, the units are connected with a rope, extended on one end by a sinking retrieval rope. The floats are removed immediately after deployment. Any number of units can be deployed to the bottom. It depends on the experimental design and the number of replicates. Retrieval of the set starts with locating the trays by means of GPS, and searching for the retrieval rope by means of a grappling hook dragged behind the boat. Based on our own experience and the literature, the possibilities of development of the described system are proposed depending on the local field conditions and research objectives.
Le dispositif de plate-forme expérimentale présenté permet de réaliser des expériences de terrain à des profondeurs considérables, toute l'année, et sans besoin de techniques de plongée. L'ensemble déployé peut être entièrement caché sous l'eau, ce qui est un avantage dans les zones fréquentées. L'ensemble est composé d'unités simples, chacune composée d'un plateau rempli d'un substrat, avec une corde à chaque coin avec boucle, et d'une corde de suspension avec un flotteur marqueur amovible fixé au moyen d'un mousqueton. Le flotteur fournit des informations sur l'emplacement des plateaux déployés et permet une distribution correcte des plateaux successifs à déployer. Après le déploiement depuis un bateau, les unités sont reliées par une corde, prolongée à une extrémité par une corde de récupération lestée. Les flotteurs sont retirés immédiatement après le déploiement. Un nombre quelconque d'unités peut être déployé sur le fond. Cela dépend de la conception expérimentale et du nombre de répétitions. La récupération de l'ensemble commence par la localisation des plateaux au moyen du GPS et la recherche de la corde de récupération au moyen d'un crochet traîné derrière le bateau. Sur la base de notre propre expérience et de la littérature, les possibilités de développement du système décrit sont proposées en fonction des conditions locales de terrain et des objectifs de recherche.},

	abstract = {Many freshwater bivalves restore themselves to the sediment water interface after burial by upward escape burrowing. We studied the escape burrowing capacity of two modern unionoids, Elliptio complanata and Pyganodon cataracta and the invasive freshwater venerid Corbicula fluminea, in a controlled laboratory setting varying sediment grain size and burial depth. We found that the relatively streamlined E. complanata is a better escape burrower than the more obese P. cataracta. E. complanata is more likely to escape burial in both fine and coarse sand, and at faster rates than P. cataracta. However, successful escape from 10 cm burial, especially in fine sand, is unlikely for both unionoids. The comparatively small and obese C. fluminea outperforms both unionoids in terms of escape probability and escape time, especially when body size is taken into consideration. C. fluminea can escape burial depths many times its own size, while the two unionoids rarely escape from burial equivalent to the length of their shells. E. complanata, and particularly P. cataracta, are morphological paradigms for the extinct Devonian unionoid bivalve Archanodon catskillensis, common in riverine facies of the Devonian Catskill Delta Complex of the eastern United States. Our observations suggest that the escape burrowing capability of A. catskillensis was no better than that of P. cataracta. Archanodon catskillensis was likely unable to escape burial of more than a few centimeters of anastrophically deposited sediment. The long (up to 1 meter), vertical burrows that are associated with A. catskillensis, and interpreted to be its escape burrows, represent a response to episodic, small-scale sedimentation events due to patterns of repetitive hydrologic or weather-related phenomena. They are not a response to a single anastrophic event involving the influx of massive volumes of sediment.},

However, not all human-relevant toxic compounds can be detected by these biomonitors. Therefore, a new on-line biosensor has been developed, containing immobilized genetically modified bacteria, which respond to genotoxicity in the water by emitting luminescence. The performance of this sensor was tested under laboratory conditions, as well as under field conditions at a monitoring station along the river Meuse in The Netherlands. The sensor was robust and easy to clean, with inert materials, temperature control and nutrient feed for the reporter organisms. The bacteria were immobilized in sol-gel on either an optical fiber or a glass slide and then continuously exposed to water. Since the glass slide was more sensitive and robust, only this setup was used in the field. The sensor responded to spikes of genotoxic compounds in the water with a minimal detectable concentration of 0.01 mg/L mitomycin C in the laboratory and 0.1 mg/L mitomycin C in the field. With further optimization, which should include a reduction in daily maintenance, the sensor has the potential to become a useful addition to the currently available biomonitors.},

	abstract = {This dissertation is a study of petroleum performances. It is a creative, performative, and speculative analysis of industrial petroleum operations, rhetorics about petroleum, and everyday North American life capacitated by petroleum products. North American petroleum operations and relations are examined through comparison and substitution with indigenous legal thought. This dissertation, in two parts, focuses on two technical operations of the petroleum industry, a refinery and a pipeline hub.    Part One: Refining Petroleum Performances is about petroleum performances analyzed and speculated through the refining processes of the BP Cherry Point Refinery located at Xwe'chi'eXen. These chapters explore petroleum performances through analogy, parable and allegory figured by thinking with indigenous jurisprudence and ecological figuration. The analysis and speculations are arranged around a technical description of refinery processes from incoming crude to finished fuels. Nested and nestled within the refinery performance, its form analogizes to refine a taxonomy of petroleum performances; combustion, petroleum relations, motive power, works and rhetoric about petroleum, petroleum infrastructure and backgrounds, petroleum jurisprudence, and petroleum allegories. The technical description diagrams a parable of petroleum performance saturated with examples from art, industry, and the everyday.    Part two of Petroleum Performances, Pipelining Spacetime, examines how pipelines perform petroleum spacetime. It demonstrates how petroleum and petroleum rhetoric perform and reinforce grand narratives and teleological futures. This petroleum space/time continuum is contrasted with periodic and place-based temporalities of some indigenous jurisdictions. Pipeline Spacetime investigates Patoka terminal, a place full of pipelines through experiences of times and places that refuses pipelines.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades the crustacean aquaculture sector has been steadily growing, in order to meet global demands for its products. A major hurdle for further growth of the industry is the prevalence of viral disease epidemics that are facilitated by the intense culture conditions. A devastating virus impacting on the sector is the White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), responsible for over US \$ 10 billion in losses in shrimp production and trade. The Pathogenicity of WSSV is high, reaching 100 \% mortality within 3-10 days in penaeid shrimps. In contrast, the European shore crab Carcinus maenas has been shown to be relatively resistant to WSSV. Uncovering the basis of this resistance could help inform on the development of strategies to mitigate the WSSV threat. C. maenas has been used widely in studies on ecotoxicology and host-pathogen interactions. However, like most aquatic crustaceans, the genomic resources available for this species are limited, impairing experimentation. Therefore, to facilitate interpretations of the exposure studies, we first produced a C. maenas transcriptome and genome scaffold assembly. We also produced a transcriptome for the European lobster (Homarus gammarus), an ecologically and commercially important crustacean species in United Kingdom waters, for use in comparing WSSV responses in this, a susceptible species, and C. maenas.For the C. maenas transcriptome assembly we isolated and pooled RNA from twelve different tissues and sequenced RNA on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. After de novo assembly a transcriptome encompassing 212,427 transcripts was produced. Similar, the H. gammarus transcriptome was based on RNA from nine tissues and contained 106,498 transcripts. The transcripts were filtered and annotated using a variety of tools (including BLAST, MEGAN and RSEM) and databases (including GenBank, Gene Ontology and KEGG). The annotation rate for transcripts in both transcriptomes was around 20-25 \% which appears to be common for aquatic crustacean species, as a result of the lack of well annotated gene sequences for this clade. Since it is likely that the host immune system would play an important role in WSSV infection we characterized the IMD, JAK/STAT, Tolllike receptor and other innate immune system pathways. We found a strong overlap between the immune system pathways in C. maenas and H. gammarus. In addition we investigated the sequence diversity of known WSSV interacting proteins amongst susceptible penaeid shrimp/lobster and the more resistant C. maenas. There were differences in viral receptor sequences, like Rab7, that correlate with a less efficient infection by WSSV.To produce the genome scaffold assembly for C. maenas we isolated DNA from muscle tissue and produced both paired-end and mate pair libraries for processing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. A de novo draft genome assembly consisting of 338,980 scaffolds and covering 362 Mb (36 \% of estimated genome size) was produced, using SOAP-denovo2 coupled with the BESST scaffolding system. The generated assembly was highly fragmented due to the presence of repetitive areas in the C. maenas genome.},

	abstract = {The number of herbivores in populations of ectothermic vertebrates decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, fish consuming plant matter are exclusively omnivorous. We assess whether omnivorous fish readily shift to herbivory or whether animal prey is typically preferred. We address temperature as the key factor causing their absence at higher latitudes and discuss the potential poleward dispersion caused by climate changes. A controlled experiment illustrates that rudd (Scardinius erythrophthalmus) readily utilize plant matter at water temperatures above 20 °C and avoid its consumption below 20 °C. Field data support these results, showing that plant matter dominates rudd diets during the summer and is absent during the spring. Utilizing cellulose requires the enzyme cellulase, which is produced by microorganisms growing at temperatures of 15-42 °C. Water temperatures at higher latitudes do not reach 15 °C year-round; at our latitude of 50°N{\textasciitilde}150 days/year. Hence, the species richness of omnivorous fish decreases dramatically above 55° latitude. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that strict herbivorous specialists have developed only in the tropics. Temperatures below 15 °C, even for a short time period, inactivate cellulase and cause diet limitations for omnivorous fish. However, we may expect increases in herbivory at higher latitudes caused by climate change.},

David Gilvear is a Professor of River Science at the University of Plymouth, UK. His river research has been at the hydrology, geomorphology and ecology interface within a geographically-led space-time framework - inspired by his PhD supervisor, Professor Petts. The majority of research has been in response to catchment specific, national or global issues in river management and as such he has worked with industry, environmental bodies and regulatory authorities.

Malcolm Greenwood is an ecologist, with a special interest in entomology, and is now retired from Loughborough University. He has worked closely with Professor Petts over many years, bringing together the biological principles appropriate to our understanding of contemporary and palaeo river systems, including the changes brought about by river engineering and management practices.

Martin Thoms is a Professor of River Science at the University of New England, Armidale, Australia. He believes the most exciting research is undertaken at boundaries - the boundaries between different disciplines, the science-management-policy boundary and the boundaries between rivers and their floodplains. His research in this domain has occurred in both national and international settings.

Paul Wood is Professor of Ecohydrology at Loughborough University, UK. His research encompasses the disciplines of hydrology, ecology, geomorphology and environmental management to address contemporary questions in River Science. His research is centred on environmental flows and the effects of disturbances in surface and groundwater dominated systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract              Consistent inter-individual behavioral differences in animals, or animal personalities, are increasingly recognized as an important component of sexual selection. Despite growing evidence for personality-mediated effects on reproductive success in species with biparental care, the link between personality and intrasexual competition or mate choice in species with uniparental care remains largely unexplored. Here, the non-caring sex in particular should seek partners with personality traits that promise high quality care. Therefore, we investigated effects of male personality in the common goby, a well-established model species for sexual selection under exclusive male care. Using competitive trials, we investigated how personality affects male ability to monopolize either of two central reproductive resources, nesting sites (male-male competition) and ready-to-spawn females (female choice). Personalities were scored in a feeding context and thus independent of reproduction. We found that slow-feeding individuals better succeeded in monopolizing nests, but that female spawning decisions were independent of the foraging personality of two male competitors. Instead, females showed a remarkably consistent between-female spawning preference for slightly heavier males and males with more elaborate nests. Our findings indicate that fitness benefits of the male personality type only materialize via male-male competition in environments where nesting sites are a limiting resource, whereas female choice favors large males with elaborate nests independent of male personality.              Significance statement              Animal personality can strongly affect reproductive success in species with parental care. We studied this link in the common goby, a fish where males build nests and solely take care of the brood until hatching. Hence, females should choose a male whose personality traits promise high quality care. We scored male personalities and conducted nest-competition and mate-choice trials. We found that male personality had an effect on nest monopolization, but not on female mating preferences. Instead, females agreed remarkably well in their mating decisions and consistently favored large males with elaborate nests. Our results show that male personality is important for nest allocation, which is crucial in environments where nesting sites are rare.},

	abstract = {The softshell clam, Mya arenaria, is a commercially important bivalve species that is found in soft-bottom intertidal habitats throughout the Gulf of Maine, USA. This species is subjected to seasonal blooms of the toxic algae Alexandrium spp., and acts as a vector for paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) during harmful algal bloom (HAB) events. Some clams possess a naturally occurring genetic mutation of their voltage-gated sodium channels that grants them a resistance to the paralytic effects of saxitoxin (STX) produced by Alexandrium spp. The mutation allows these individuals to continue feeding during HABs, and greatly increases their tissue toxicity through bioaccumulation. This work describes the distribution of the resistant mutation in wild clam populations in the Gulf of Maine, and explores the population structure of M. arenaria with regard to the mutation, as well as neutral genetic markers. Analysis of neutral markers revealed no significant population structure within the Gulf of Maine, however  M arenaria does exhibit strong localized structure at the STX-resistant mutation locus. This structure is sustained by differential selective pressure exerted by Alexandrium spp. blooms, despite freely occurring gene flow among clam populations. In Penobscot Bay, one area where the prevalence of the resistant mutation did not match the strength of selective pressure, it is likely that the resistant allele is maintained by gene flow through larval transport from other regions, rather than by seeding of hatchery stock carrying the mutation. This work can aid PSP monitoring efforts by identifying areas where risk is greatest to humans due to high numbers of resistant clams. In addition, distinguishing areas where one genotype is clearly favored over the others may be of interest to seeding programs trying to ensure that their stock is well-suited for the location to which they will be transplanted.},

In essence, the current available literature has covered from the very specific brain region or neurons of zebrafish, which are responsible for reproductive regulation, until the gonadal level of the animal. The discoveries and findings have proven that this small animal is sharing a very close/similar reproductive system with mammals.

Effective biomonitoring of an ecosystem requires, however, that multiple biomarkers be used to obtain an accurate measure of the cumulative effects of different sources of environmental stress. Here, we provide a first integrated review of the biological, economical, and geographical characteristics of another species of mussels, the ribbed mussel Aulacomya ater. We discuss the use of Aulacomya ater as a complementary biomonitor to the blue mussel to assess the impact of pollutants and climate change. Recent findings have indeed shown that Mytilus edulis and Aulacomya ater have distinctive anatomy and physiology and respond differently to environmental stress. Monitoring of mixed beds containing blue and ribbed mussels may thus represent a unique opportunity to study the effect of environmental stress on the biodiversity of marine ecosystems, most notably in the Southern hemisphere, which is particularly sensitive to climate change and where both species often cohabitate in the same intertidal zones.},

Here, we forecast the population trend of the largest European population of the bearded vulture (Gypaetus barbatus) over the next 30 years under different demographic and management scenarios (removal of eggs, chicks or fledglings). Projections derived from the combination of a PDP model (Population Dynamic P-system) and a Box-Behnken design would lead to a decline in 77\% of all 57 scenarios analysed. Among the 13 scenarios predicting a population increase, only 4 seem realistic in terms of growth rate (0.04\%-1.01\%), at least if current age at first breeding and productivity would remain constant over time. Our simulations thus suggest that most extraction scenarios would have detrimental effects on the demography of the donor population. Release of captive-born young or removal of only the second hatched chick for subsequent captive rearing and translocation into the wild appear to represent much better supplementation and reintroduction options in this threatened species.},

In this study, we compared the bioaccumulations of As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb, Se, and Zn between the American alligator, Alligator mississippiensis, and its parasites in order to establish their use as bioindicators of heavy metal pollution. Concomitant with these results, we were interested to determine if parasites were more sensitive bioindicators of heavy metals relative to alligators. We found parasites collectively accumulated higher levels of As, Cu, Se, and Zn in comparison to their alligator hosts, whereas Fe, Cd, and Pb concentrations were higher in alligators. Interestingly, Fe levels were significantly greater in intestinal trematodes than their alligator hosts when analyzed independently from other parasitic taxa. Further analyses showed alligator intestinal trematodes concentrated As, Cu, Fe, Se, and Zn at significantly higher levels than intestinal nematodes and parasites from other organs. However, pentastomids also employed the role as a good biomagnifier of As. Interestingly, parasitic abundance decreased as levels of As increased. Stomach and intestinal nematodes were the poorest bioaccumulators of metals, yet stomach nematodes showed their ability to concentrate Pb at orders of magnitude higher in comparison to other parasites. Conclusively, we suggest that parasites, particularly intestinal trematodes, are superior biomagnifiers of As, Cu, Se, and Zn, whereas alligators are likely good biological indicators of Fe, Cd, and Pb levels within the environment.},

	abstract = {Interfacial water constitutes a formidable barrier to strong surface bonding, hampering the development of water-resistant synthetic adhesives. Notwithstanding this obstacle, the Asian green mussel Perna viridis attaches firmly to underwater surfaces via a proteinaceous secretion (byssus). Extending beyond the currently known design principles of mussel adhesion, here we elucidate the precise time-regulated secretion of P. viridis mussel adhesive proteins. The vanguard 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (Dopa)-rich protein Pvfp-5 acts as an adhesive primer, overcoming repulsive hydration forces by displacing surface-bound water and generating strong surface adhesion. Using homology modelling and molecular dynamics simulations, we find that all mussel adhesive proteins are largely unordered, with Pvfp-5 adopting a disordered structure and elongated conformation whereby all Dopa residues reside on the protein surface. Time-regulated secretion and structural disorder of mussel adhesive proteins appear essential for optimizing extended nonspecific surface interactions and byssus' assembly. Our findings reveal molecular-scale principles to help the development of wet-resistant adhesives.},

Their ability to fix dissolved N2 allows cyanobacteria to circumvent the general summer nitrogen limitation, while also generating a supply of novel bioavailable nitrogen for the food web. However, the fate of the nitrogen fixed by cyanobacteria remains unresolved, as does its importance for secondary production in the Baltic Sea. Here, we synthesize recent experimental and field studies providing strong empirical evidence that cyanobacterial nitrogen is efficiently assimilated and transferred in Baltic food webs via two major pathways: directly by grazing on fresh or decaying cyanobacteria and indirectly through the uptake by other phytoplankton and microbes of bioavailable nitrogen exuded from cyanobacterial cells. This information is an essential step toward guiding nutrient management to minimize noxious blooms without overly reducing secondary production, and ultimately most probably fish production in the Baltic Sea.},

The different biodeposit enrichment regimes created, which mimicked the quantity of faeces and pseudo-faeces potentially deposited below mussel farms, show a clear stimulatory effect of this organic enrichment on prokaryotic metabolic activity. This effect was detected once a certain level of biodeposition was attained with a tipping point estimated between 3.25 and 10 g day-1 m-2. Prokaryotic communities recovered their initial metabolic activity by 11 days after the cessation of biodeposit additions. However, their functional diversity remained greater than prior to the disturbance suggesting that mussel biodeposit enrichment may disturb the functioning and perhaps the role of prokaryotic communities in benthic ecosystems. This manipulative approach provided new information on the influence of mussel biodeposition on benthic prokaryotic communities and dose-response relationships and may support the development of carrying capacity models for bivalve culture.},

To highlight if changes in biochemical responses (digestive enzymes and reserves) led to impairments at an individual level (fertility), Gammarus fossarum were submitted to a lower food intake throughout a complete female reproductive cycle (i.e. from ovogenesis to offspring production). For both males and females, amylase activity was inhibited by the diet stress, whereas trypsin activity was not influenced. These results underline similar sensitivity of males and females concerning their digestive capacity. Energy reserves decreased with food starvation in females, and remained stable in males. The number of embryos per female decreased with food starvation. Lower digestive activity in males and females therefore appears as an early response. These results underline the ecological relevance of digestive markers, as they make it possible to anticipate upcoming consequences on reproduction in females, a key biological variable for population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Filtration capacity and feeding behaviour has been intensely studied for adult mussels (Mytilus edulis), but less information is available for juvenile mussels (1.5-25 mm, {\textless}1 year), especially in natural sea water. The recent introduction of mussel seed collectors in the Netherlands prompted the need for more detailed information on juvenile mussel behaviour. To estimate the impact of juvenile populations on ecosystem carrying capacity, information on clearance rate as well as usage of different prey items is essential. Clearance rates were measured in an experimental study, incubating juvenile mussels in natural sea water. Rates were related to isometrics as well as specified for the prey items bacteria, picophytoplankton ({\textless}3 [mu]m), nanophytoplankton (3-20 [mu]m), and ciliates. Results showed that the clearance rate of juvenile mussels depends on shell length{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum}, while the relationship between clearance rate and weight was more variable. Length is thus a better parameter for estimating clearance rate than weight. Ciliates and nanophytoplankton were cleared at comparable, but variable rates, while picoalgae were cleared from the water at the rate of 11-64 \% compared to nanophytoplankton. For bacteria, the clearance rate was on average 9 \%. This study showed different retention of particles of similar size (picoalgae and bacteria) as well as variability in particle retention for the different prey items. This variable retention efficiency could not be related to seston concentration nor to dominance in cell size. The results from this study can be used to estimate the effect of mussel seed collectors on the carrying capacity of the Dutch Wadden Sea.},

	abstract = {Examine all the 'scary' invaders the media has warned us about. The Japanese long horn beetle, emerald ash borer, purple loose strife, spruce bud worm, and Dutch elm disease. These alien invaders make a big splash in the media and then they disappear. That is exactly what happens in nature. They become part of the natural landscape. I've lived with all of these organisms for over three decades and my landscape still has spruce, elm and ash trees.


What does tend to happen initially, for an alien species that finds an open niche, is an 'overpopulation' locally for a period of time but eventually a new population equilibrium is established because there are limited resources in any ecosystem, which becomes the limiting factor for any 'overpopulation.' The only way an invasive population can continue to expand is by importing those resources which are limited in its immediate vicinity. We can process economic trade, and the globalization of trade means the globalization of both alien species and disease organisms, i.e. west Nile virus. It is ironic that economic trade is responsible for the redistribution of most alien species.


Wouldn't it be refreshing if politicians, bureaucrats and the media learned a little natural history so their good intensions would have a sound biological basis. Then I'd be less suspicious of such legislation as just 'smoke and mirrors' to avoid dealing with the really important contemporary issues.},

	abstract = {Each year, hundreds of millions of people travel across international borders or even oceans, and up to 230 million may remain for long periods.  Among these, 3-5 million settle permanently in their new homes, with about 1 million migrating permanently to the United States of America. This may result in transport of parasites and other pathogens, which might become established, infecting individuals in the new location.  Beyond concern of disease spread, the health of migrants is of concern since the rigors, circumstances, and living conditions surrounding migrations may increase the vulnerability of migrants to infections.  International adoptees and refugees are a small subset of these migrants but are of special significance inasmuch as adoptees may be more vulnerable to infection due to their immature immune status, and refugees may be more vulnerable due to substandard living conditions.  Both originate from diverse regions, but often from environments of low hygiene and health care standards.  This review examines recent examples of infections reported from adoptees and refugees entering the USA through 2010, highlighting the most common origin countries and the diseases most frequently involved, including Chagas disease, Balamuthia amebic meningoencephalitis, giardiasis, microsporidiosis, hepatitis, measles, pertussis, tuberculosis, malaria, intestinal helminths, and syphilis.},

	abstract = {Microcystins are secondary metabolites produced by cyanobacteria that act as hepatotoxins in higher organisms. These toxins can be altered through abiotic processes, such as photodegradation and adsorption, as well as through biological processes via metabolism and bacterial degradation. Some species of bacteria can degrade microcystins, and many other organisms metabolize microcystins into a series of conjugated products. There are toxicokinetic models used to examine microcystin uptake and elimination, which can be difficult to compare due to differences in compartmentalization and speciation. Metabolites of microcystins are formed as a detoxification mechanism, and little is known about how quickly these metabolites are formed. In summary, microcystins can undergo abiotic and biotic processes that alter the toxicity and structure of the microcystin molecule. The environmental impact and toxicity of these alterations and the metabolism of microcystins remains uncertain, making it difficult to establish guidelines for human health. Here, we present the current state of knowledge regarding the alterations microcystins can undergo in the environment.},

A field trial was carried out to test the respective efficacy of three different mechanical dredge methods at reducing Corbicula clam numbers by estimating changes in abundance and biomass immediately following dredging. Quadrat samples were collected by SCUBA divers before and after dredging. A maximum pre-dredge density of 17,872 individuals/m2 and a biomass of 43.94 kg/m2 was recorded. Three sites which supported different population density and biomass levels within the tidal section of the River Barrow were subject to each of the dredge methods. A reduction of greater than 95\% biomass and 95\% density was achieved at the high density, high biomass site, while an 82\% biomass and 65\% density reduction was recorded at the low density, low biomass site. A 74\% biomass and 92\% density reduction was achieved at the high density, low biomass site. The methodology and results indicate that, while dredging can achieve a large reduction in Corbicula population numbers, further research is required before this can be considered as a management tool for control of Asian clams.},

	abstract = {One does not have to look very far to see and hear stories of invasive species and the environmental damage they can cause. They take many forms and can affect different elements of our ecosystem. Certainly, few people have not heard about zebra mussels and how they have spread to so many of our water bodies. How about the Asian carp - displacing native species in waterways in North America and videos showing how dangerous it is to boat through those waterways as the fish literally jump into the boat endangering passengers. Then there is the round goby - a fish from Eurasia that has displaced native fish species in more and more of our water bodies - thought to originally have been introduced through ballast water of ships. Spiny waterflea, Eurasian water-milfoil, garlic mustard, dog-strangling vine ... the list goes on of damaging invasive species in Ontario. It is thought that the Asian long-horned beetle was introduced to the Toronto area by way of wooden shipping pallets. Thirty thousand trees were removed in an effort to stop its spread and it was declared eradicated from that infestation in the spring of 2013. Unfortunately, another infestation was found in August 2013 near the Pearson airport, requiring all infested and susceptible trees within 800 metres removed in an effort to stop that infestation from spreading. If this insect was able to spread to the broader forests of central Ontario, including Parry Sound-Muskoka, I shudder at what the impacts would be as all maples, birches, poplars and willows could succumb to this insect. People should particularly familiarize themselves with giant hogweed. This invasive plant has been found in isolated places in our region. What makes it of particular concern, is that it is poisonous requiring a person to wash their skin immediately in cool soapy water and not to expose the affected area to sunlight. It can reach over three metres tall so a person's skin can easily come in contact with this plant. A simple Internet search can help identify this noxious weed. These invasive species often have no native enemies here so can quickly build up populations and dominate their environments.},

"Dogs, because they search with their noses, they're not distracted by visual clutter," [Pete Coppolillo] said.

They can detect scents in the parts per billion."              "What makes them good scent dogs, the characteristics that we look for, are often the ones that land these dogs in the shelter," Coppolillo said. "They're high-drive, they're obsessive, they want to go, go, go, all day long. Interestingly, they do calm down when they're working, because they've got that mental stimulation and they do have a job."},

They can be sympatric in distribution, and because their larval stages are morphologically similar, monitoring them in zooplankton using microscopy protocols is often inefficient, producing ambiguous results. We designed a pair of primers to amplify a fragment of the mtDNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I of Corbicula species. A multiplex reaction, containing the specific primer pair and a pair of universal primers (to control for the quality of the DNA in the sample) was tested with regards to specificity and ability to detect Corbicula spp. larvae in plankton samples that also contain other species in different proportions. Our molecular protocol allows for fast and accurate detection of Corbicula spp. even when concentrations of these species are low in samples, which is useful when examining large volumes of ballast/piped water. Further, the protocol is valuable for the monitoring/prospecting of early stages of the life cycle of Corbicula spp. in watersheds that have been invaded, or which are considered at risk of invasion by these species.},

This study examined the impacts of a six month exposure to combined decreased pH and increased temperature on the immune response and disease status in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis L. Results provide the first confirmation that exposure to future acidification and warming conditions via aquarium-based simulation may have parallel implications for bivalve health. Collectively, the data suggests that temperature more than pH may be the key driver affecting immune response in M. edulis. Data also suggests that both increases in temperature and/or lowered pH conditions may lead to changes in parasite abundance and diversity, pathological conditions, and bacterial incidence in M. edulis. These results have implications for future management of shellfish under a predicted climate change scenario and future sustainability of shellfisheries. Examination of the combined effects of two stressors over an extended exposure period provides key preliminary data and thus, this work represents a unique and vital contribution to current research efforts towards a collective understanding of expected near-future impacts of climate change on marine environments.},

	abstract = {As the result of the ecological impacts from the use of tributyltins (TBT) in shipping, environmental legislation for the registration of chemicals for use in the environment has grown to a monumental challenge requiring product dossiers to include information on the environmental fate and behavior of any chemicals. Specifically, persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity, collectively known as PBT, are properties of concern in the assessment of chemicals. However, existing measurements of PBT properties are a cumbersome and expensive process, and thus not applied in the early stages of the product discovery and development. Inexpensive methods for preliminary PBT screening would minimize risks arising with the subsequent registration of products. In this article, we evaluated the PBT properties of compounds reported to possess anti-fouling properties using QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) prediction programs such as BIOWIN(TM) (a biodegradation probability program), KOWWIN(TM) (log octanol-water partition coefficient calculation program) and ECOSAR(TM) (Ecological Structure Activity Relationship Programme). The analyses identified some small (Mr {\textless} 400) synthetic and natural products as potential candidates for environmentally benign biocides. We aim to demonstrate that while these methods of estimation have limitations, when applied with discretion, they are powerful tools useful in the early stages of research for compound selection for further development as anti-foulants.},

It is increasingly recognized that private land conservation is an essential part of environmental protection and especially properties of non-farm, private landowners are interesting for conservation purposes. However, non-farm, private landowners are less likely to respond to traditional motivators for environmental conservation and little is known about the conservation attitudes and values of this group. Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis was used as the approach because of its practical ability to reveal how personal contexts and experiences shape these relationships and how personal meaning is created. These relationships increase quality of life, give a sense of belonging, and motivate a desire to protect the land against environmental degradation. The present private landowners expressed a well-developed conservation ethic. However, future conservation approaches for these properties are less clear, but might be achieved through conservation easement programs.},

	abstract = {Among the many biological responses studied in ecotoxicology, energy-based biomarkers such as digestive enzyme activities and energy reserves appear to be useful predictive tools for detecting physiological disturbances in organisms. However, the use of these biological responses as biomarkers could be limited by the effects of confounding factors (biotic and abiotic) and physiological processes, such as the reproductive cycle. Thus, the optimal use of these biomarkers will be facilitated by understanding the effects of these factors on the energy metabolism of the sentinel species being studied. We considered abiotic factors (temperature and conductivity) in a previous study, whereas the present study investigated the effects of gender, the female reproductive stage, and food availability on the digestive enzyme activities and energy storage of Gammarus fossarum. The results indicated that, during the female reproductive cycle, the activities of digestive enzymes (amylase, cellulase, and trypsin) decreased significantly, whereas the levels of reserves (proteins, lipids, and sugar) increased until the last premolt stage. Restricted food diets only led to decreased amylase activities in both sexes. Food starvation also induced a decrease in the energy outcomes in females, whereas there were no effects in males. In general, the biochemical (digestive enzyme activities) and physiological (energy reserves) responses were more stable in males than in females. These results support the use of males fed ad libitum to limit the effects of confounding factors when using these energy biomarkers in Gammarus fossarum during biomonitoring programs.},

The book presents research on the core issues of climate-change science in the treeless arctic region of Alaska. As a whole, it examines both terrestrial and freshwater-aquatic ecosystems, and their three typical habitats: tundra, streams, and lakes. The book provides a history of the Toolik Lake LTER site, and discusses its present condition and future outlook. It features contributions from top scientists from many fields, creating a multidisciplinary survey of the Alaskan arctic ecosystem. Chapter topics include glacial history, climatology, land-water interactions, mercury found in the Alaskan arctic, and the response of these habitats to environmental change. The final chapter predicts the consequences that arctic Alaska faces due to global warming and climate change, and discusses the future ecology of the LTER site in the region. Alaska's Changing Arctic is the definitive scientific survey of the past, present, and future of the ecology of the Alaskan arctic.},

	abstract = {Ontario borders four of the five Great Lakes, meaning it has a huge stake in the health of these inland seas. The threats facing our lakes, however, seem to multiply by the day - everything from falling water levels to the potential invasion of voracious Asian carp, an event that could make the introduction of zebra mussels look like an ecological picnic by comparison. Efforts to take better care of the lakes, however, involve a tangle of jurisdictions, treaties, laws and regulations, with responsibility spread widely across the provincial government and no clear central authority. The Great Lakes Protection Act seeks to make greater sense of our efforts to help the lakes by better co-ordinating actions to protect water quality and quantity, prevent pollution, and restore and protect natural ecosystems. It's a "must-have" if we are going to have any chance of keeping one of our greatest natural assets - and the source of drinking water for millions of people - thriving in the face of major threats such as climate change, invasive species and a growing continent-wide thirst for water.},

	abstract = {Les anguilles d'Amérique (Anguilla rostrata) et d'Europe (Anguilla anguilla) ont vu leurs populations décliner de façon très importante depuis les années 1980. Comme pour d'autres facteurs (surpêche, obstacles à la migration, changements du climat et des courants marins), la contamination semble jouer un rôle dans les déclins observés. En particulier, des effets sur l'activité d'enzymes liées aux différentes capacités métaboliques peuvent ainsi se traduire par une influence sur la croissance, la capacité de nage, les capacités respiratoires, et l'accumulation de réserves énergétiques, et possiblement contribuer à compromettre leur migration et/ou leur reproduction dans la mer des Sargasses. Dans le cadre du projet IMMORTEEL, la présente étude avait pour but de déterminer si les contaminants inorganiques accumulés dans le foie et le muscle (Cd, Cu, Zn, Ag, As, Pb, Cr, Ni, Se et Hg) pouvaient affecter les capacités métaboliques des deux espèces d'anguilles au stade jaune. Les mesures d'activités d'enzymes du foie et du muscle associées aux capacités aérobies (citrate synthase, CS; cytochrome C oxydase, CCO), aux capacités anaérobies (lactate déshydrogénase, LDH), aux capacités glycolytiques (pyruvate kinase, PK) et au métabolisme des lipides (glucose-6-phosphate déshydrogénase, G6PDH) ont alors été faites. Dans le foie d'A. rostrata, les plus fortes corrélations obtenues indiquent que la PK et la CS sont liées positivement au Zn et au Pb respectivement, tandis que la G6PDH et la LDH sont principalement affectées négativement par l'Ag et le Ni respectivement. Au niveau du muscle, la PK, la CS et la CCO sont toutes affectées particulièrement par le Hg, même si seule la PK montre une corrélation positive. Du côté d'A. anguilla, la PK et la CS du foie sont toutes deux affectées par le Pb, mais de manière positive et négative respectivement, puis la LDH est liée négativement au Zn. Dans le muscle, la PK et la LDH montrent des corrélations négatives avec l'As et le Se respectivement, puis la CS et la CCO sont toutes deux principalement liées positivement à la contamination en Zn. Par ailleurs, les résultats indiquent aussi que la concentration en protéines semble être liée aux variations d'activités enzymatiques observées dans le foie et le muscle des deux espèces d'anguilles, mais jamais de façon systématique pour une enzyme ou une espèce donnée. Enfin, la masse est aussi fortement liée de façon positive aux capacités aérobies du muscle (CS et CCO), et ce pour les deux espèces d'anguilles. Les résultats indiquent donc que la plupart des contaminants inorganiques dosés ont des effets sur les capacités métaboliques des deux espèces.Alternate abstract:American (Anguilla rostrata) and European (Anguilla anguilla) eels have experienced severe population declines since the 1980s. Along with other factors (overfishing, turbines, dams and migration obstacles, climate and ocean sea currents changes), chemical contaminants may play a key role in the observed declines. Effects of contaminants on the activity of enzymes associated with specific metabolic capacities may influence growth, swimming capacity, respiratory capacities and energetic reserves accumulation of the eels, and ultimately compromise their migration and/or reproduction in the Sargasso Sea. As a part of the IMMORTEEL project, the present study aimed to determine whether inorganic contaminants (Cd, Cu, Zn, Ag, As, Pb, Cr, Ni, Se and Hg) accumulated in liver and muscle could have an effect on the metabolic capacities of both species in their yellow stage. Enzyme activity measurements were performed for aerobic capacities (citrate synthase, CS; cytochrome C oxidase, CCO), anaerobic capacities (lactate dehydrogenase, LDH), glycolitic capacities (pyruvate kinase, PK), and lipid metabolism (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, G6PDH). In liver of A. rostrata, the strongest correlations obtained indicate that PK and CS are positively related to Zn and Pb, respectively, while G6PDH and LDH are principally negatively related to Ag and Ni, respectively. In muscle, PK is positively correlated to Hg, while CS and CCO are negatively correlated to Hg. For A. anguilla, liver PK and CS are positively and negatively related to Pb, respectively, and LDH is negatively related to Zn. In the muscle, PK and LDH show negative correlations with As and Se, respectively, while CS and CCO are both positively correlated to Zn concentrations. Otherwise, results indicate that protein concentration seems to be linked to the enzyme activity variations observed in liver and muscle of both eel species, but not in a systematic way for a given enzyme or species. Finally, weight is also strongly associated to the aerobic capacities (CS and CCO) of both species. AU these results allow us to believe that most of the inorganic contaminants studied have effects on the metabolic capacities of both eel species.},

	abstract = {Les concentrations de platine et de palladium dans l'environnement ont considérablement augmenté dans les trente dernières années en raison des particules émises par les convertisseurs catalytiques des systèmes d'échappement des véhicules. Peu de données sont disponibles quant à la biodisponibilité et la toxicité de ces deux métaux. Pour évaluer la toxicité de ces deux éléments, l'algue verte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii a été exposée à plusieurs concentrations de Pd et de Pt. Pour évaluer l'influence de la spéciation du métal sur sa toxicité et son internalisation, trois différentes valeurs de pH (6,0, 7,0 et 8,0) ont été utilisées. Les concentrations nominales d'exposition étaient comprises entre 18 et 282 nM pour le palladium et entre 26 et 512 nM pour le platine; les concentrations expérimentales ont été mesurées par ICP-MS. La spéciation du palladium a été modélisée en utilisant Visual MINTEQ, mais celle du Pt n'a pu être estimée en raison de l'absence de données thermodynamiques fiables. La densité cellulaire a été déterminée à chaque 24 heures et a été utilisée comme paramètre pour l'évaluation de la toxicité. Aucun des deux métaux n'a eu d'incidence sur le rendement, mais un retard dans la croissance a été observé à mesure que les concentrations augmentaient. Pour le Pd, la croissance a été retardée de manière plus importante à pH 7 comparé à pH 6 et aucun délai n'a été constaté à pH 8 pour une même gamme de concentrations. Des résultats similaires ont été observés pour le Pt. Les CE50 déterminées ont confirmé une toxicité accrue à pH neutre. L'internalisation de ces métaux est fortement corrélée avec la concentration de métal mesurée dans le milieu de culture et change en fonction du pH. Pour évaluer l'influence de la complexation du Pd par l'ammoniac, des expériences ont été menées avec une concentration plus faible en ammonium, avec comme résultat une toxicité réduite. Étonnamment, une variation de la concentration de calcium dans le milieu de culture n'a pas eu d'effet sur la toxicité du palladium. Les concentrations environnementales de Pt et de Pd peuvent se rapprocher des CE50 calculées et l'émission continue de ces métaux dans l'environnement laisse présager une augmentation des concentrations dans l'eau qui pourraient nuire aux écosystèmes aquatiques dans un proche avenir.Alternate abstract:Platinum and palladium concentrations in the environ ment have increased considerably over the past 30 years, due to particles emitted by the catalytic converters in vehicle exhaust systems. Yet, little is known about the bioavailability and toxicity of these two metals. To assess the toxicity of these two elements towards aquatic organisms, the freshwater green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was exposed to various concentratidns of Pd and Pt. To explore the influence of metal speciation on uptake and toxicity, experiments were performed at pH 6.0, 7.0 and 8.0. Targeted total metal concentrations varied from 18 to 282 nM for palladium and from 26 to 512 nM for platinum; total metal concentrations were determined by ICP-MS. Palladium speciation was modeled using the Visual MINTEQ program, but speciation couldn't be estimated for Pt, due to the lack of reliable thermodynamic data. The algal density was monitored every 24 h and was used as a toxicity endpoint. Neither metal had an effect or' the yield, but both induced an increase in the lag phase as the exposure concentrations increased. For Pd, the lag phase was longer at pH 7 than at pH 6 whereas no effects were observed at pH 8 over the tested range of concentrations; similar results were obtained for Pt. The calculated ECso confirmed a higher toxicity at neutral pH than for the other tested pHs. The uptake of the two metals was strongly correlated with measured metal content of the exposure media and was influenced by pH. To investigate the influence of ammonia on Pd complexation, experiments were also performed in low ammonium media, which resulted in reduced toxicity. The effect of water hardness on Pd toxicity was also studied, without clear evidence of an influence on the algal response. Environmental concentrations of Pt and Pd can be near the calculated ECso values and the continued emissions of these two metals to the environ ment suggest that exceedances may happen more frequently in the future.},

	abstract = {'Nuisance species' (or 'invasive' species) are often proposed to be the second most important concern in the context of the current biodiversity crisis. Despite increasing evidence that exotic species do not always become invasive, this perception is still common in the scientific community. This suggests that other issues are at stake in the concept of nuisance species rather than just the problems they raise, grounded mostly in ecological or economic arguments.              We retraced the evolution of pigeon representation in France through an extensive review of ancient texts related to pigeons and reviewed more than 240 source texts, dating from the seventh century to the 1990s. We completed these data with literature on human-animal relationships and animal conceptions in religious, philosophical, scientific, and political currents of thought that were representative of Western and, specifically, French tradition.              We used the heated debate over pigeons (Columba livia) as pests as a case study by analyzing the ecological, social, economic, and political relations regarding pigeons. Through a historical perspective of the debate about and understanding of pigeons, we propose a new and complementary explanation for the modern thinking of pigeons as a nuisance species, based on what we termed their socio-nature characteristics. In particular, we used social representations theory to highlight the issues of human identity construction at stake in the construction of pigeons as a nuisance species.              We invite the reader to consider the impact of such human self-definition on environmental stances, as it could constrain further developments or improvements of conservation perspectives.},

However, their role as biomarkers for monitoring the environmental risk assessment is controversial due to a number of conflicting, validating, and nonvalidating reports. The current knowledge regarding the interpretation of HSPs expression levels has been discussed in the present review. The candidature of heat shock proteins as biomarkers of toxicity is thus far unreliable due to synergistic effects of toxicants and other environmental factors.

	abstract = {Fishes are often classified into warm-, cool-, and cold-water guilds depending on the temperatures in which they best survive and reproduce. The northern range-boundaries of many warm- and cool-water fish species lie within Ontario. Until recently, the areas north and east of Lake Superior and most of the northern half of the province were too cold for Smallmouth Bass, a warmwater species. In the past, many introductions of warm-water fish in northern lakes would have failed because colder temperatures limited the establishment of these species. With climate warming, the northern range-boundaries of Smallmouth Bass and other cooland warm-water fishes are expected to move north. My colleagues at the University of Toronto and I recently investigated this hypothesis using data from the ROM's fish collection database and surveys completed by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources.


Freshwater ecosystems are believed to be particularly vulnerable to species introductions. The devastating effects of zebra mussels in Ontario's Lake St. Clair (so clearly illustrated in the Life in Crisis: Schad Gallery of Biodiversity at the ROM) are an example of the impacts introduced species can have. As fish species move toward more northerly latitudes they are introduced to new lakes and stream reaches. Range-expansion by populations of Smallmouth Bass, a predator that often feeds on small fish, is predicted to threaten thousands of populations of minnows. Smallmouth Bass is also known to compete for food with Lake Trout, a coldwater fish. In some lakes where Smallmouth Bass has been introduced. Lake Trout has changed its diet and begun feeding on less rewarding prey, which may very well reduce growth and reproduction.


The now irrefutable fact of climate warming has begun to facilitate the spread and establishment of many species into new areas, and the different impacts of these introductions on resident species and their ecosystems are still unclear in most cases. Climate warming has been and is expected to be most intense at higher latitudes and, according to the IPCC, the region around the Great Lakes is projected to warm 50 percent more than the global average. There's no doubt therefore that the ROM's collection will become increasingly important as we continue to investigate the impacts of climate change in Ontario and around the globe, o},

	abstract = {The discovery of two grass carp - one in April, the other in August - in the Grand River near Dunnville, close to Lake Erie - is giving federal and provincial biologists pause, and well it should. While both of the carp were determined to be sterile, and although they may not be as feared as two other varieties of this invasive species - the bighead carp and the jumping silver carp - this is no time for complacency.              Gord Miller, Ontario's environmental commissioner, said as much Oct. 11 as he released his annual report. In that report, he bemoaned the lack of a provincial action plan, and the attendant funding, to confront invasive species such as Asian carp and the emerald ash borer. Miller said it would be a "wise investment, potentially averting the risks and financial costs associated with invasive species that we have seen with previous introductions." The zebra mussel invasion of the Great Lakes is an illustration of that.},

	abstract = {Brevibacillus laterosporus, a bacterium characterized by the production of a unique canoe-shaped lamellar body attached to one side of the spore, is a natural inhabitant of water, soil and insects. Its biopesticidal potential has been reported against insects in different orders including Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Diptera and against nematodes and mollusks. In addition to its pathogenicity against invertebrates, different B. laterosporus strains show a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity including activity against phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi. A wide variety of molecules, including proteins and antibiotics, have been associated with the observed pathogenicity and mode of action. Before being considered as a biological control agent against plant pathogens, the antifungal and antibacterial properties of certain B. laterosporus strains have found medical interest, associated with the production of antibiotics with therapeutic effects. The recent whole genome sequencing of this species revealed its potential to produce polyketides, nonribosomal peptides, and toxins. Another field of growing interest is the use of this bacterium for bioremediation of contaminated sites by exploiting its biodegradation properties. The aim of the present review is to gather and discuss all recent findings on this emerging entomopathogen, giving a wider picture of its complex and broad-spectrum biocontrol activity.},

Thraustochytrids, part of the larger taxonomic class Labyrinthulomycetes, contain several highly pathogenic species, including the hard clam pathogen quahog parasite unknown (QPX). QPX has been associated with large-scale mortality events along the northeastern coast of North America. Growth and physiology of QPX is temperature-dependent, and changes in local temperature profiles influence pathogenicity. In this study we characterize the partial genome of QPX and examine the influence of temperature on gene expression. Genes involved in several biological processes are differentially expressed upon temperature change, including those associated with altered growth and metabolism and virulence. The genomic and transcriptomic resources developed in this study provide a foundation for better understanding virulence, pathogenicity and life history of thraustochytrid pathogens.},

	abstract = {Biosecurity is the assessment and management of potentially dangerous infectious diseases, quarantined pests, invasive (alien) species, living modified organisms, and biological weapons. It is a holistic concept of direct relevance to the sustainability of agriculture, food safety, and the protection of human populations (including bio-terrorism), the environment, and biodiversity. Biosecurity is a relatively new concept that has become increasingly prevalent in academic, policy and media circles, and needs a more comprehensive and inter-disciplinary approach to take into account mobility, globalisation and climate change. In this introductory volume, biosecurity is presented as a governance approach to a set of concerns that span the protection of indigenous biological organisms, agricultural systems and human health, from invasive pests and diseases. It describes the ways in which biosecurity is understood and theorized in different subject disciplines, including anthropology, political theory, ecology, geography and environmental management. It examines the different scientific and knowledge practices connected to biosecurity governance, including legal regimes, ecology, risk management and alternative knowledges. The geopolitics of biosecurity is considered in terms of health, biopolitics and trade governance at the global scale. Finally, biosecurity as an approach to actively secure the future is assessed in the context of future risk and uncertainties, such as globalization and climate change.},

	abstract = {The Global Casino is an introduction to environmental issues which deals both with the workings of the physical environment and the political, economic and social frameworks in which the issues occur. Using examples from all over the world, the book highlights the underlying causes behind environmental problems, the human actions which have made them issues, and the hopes for solutions. It is a book about the human impact on the environment and the ways in which the natural environment impacts human society. The fifth edition has been fully revised and updated throughout, with new case studies, figures, and online resources such as downloadable figures and tables from the text and multiple choice questions for students, accessible at: www.routledge.com/cw/middleton. New topics covered in extended boxed case studies include payment for environmental services, ocean acidification, biofuels in Brazil, waste reduction through industrial symbiosis, and the long-term impact of natural disasters on vulnerable groups. Other approaches and concepts covered for the first time in this new edition include traditional ecological knowledge, environmental justice, the 'resource curse', and urban biodiversity. Eighteen chapters on key issues follow three initial chapters which outline the background contexts of the physical and human environments and the concept of sustainable development. Each chapter provides historical context for key issues, outlines why they have arisen, and highlights areas of controversy and uncertainty to appraise how issues can be resolved both technically and in political and economic frameworks. Each chapter also contains an updated critical guide to further reading and websites, as well as discussion points and essay questions. The text can be read in its entirety or individual chapters adopted as standalone reading. The Global Casino is an essential resource for students of the environment, geography, earth sciences and development studies. It provides comprehensive and inspirational coverage of all the major global environmental issues of the day in a style that is clear and critical.},

Sampling was carried out using bottom trawl in depths of 3-6 m, from January to November 2005, and from October to November 2008. Pimelodus pintado began to prey upon L. fortunei soon after its arrival (austral spring of 2005). On the spring of 2008, L. fortunei was found to be the most important food item of P. pintado. The variation in length of the mussels (0.7-3.2 cm, with a mode of 1.3 cm) indicates that the species is now fully established in the system. Our data indicates that large individuals of P. pintado incorporate more mussels in their diets than small individuals. However, regardless of their size, P. pintado individuals predate only on small ({\textless}1.4 cm) representatives of L. fortunei. This prey size corresponds to a phase when the mussel is more mobile and readily available for fish. Larger, more aggregated prey groups that are attached to hard substrates are avoided by fish predators.  [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Characterization of Montreal municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) has identified the presence of pharmaceuticals and persona\vphantom{\{}\} care products (PPCP), alkyphenols (AP), polychlminated biphenyls (PCB), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and heavy metals. MWWE contains mixtures of xenobiotics that have been shown to disrupt normal metabolic and cellular functions.Previous studies have shown that fish exposed to MWWE have resulted in altered cellular signaling in the testis. These processes are facilitated by transmembrane proteins called connexins (Cx) which form gap junctions (GJ). GJ allow the passage of small molecules between neighbouring cells, called gap junction intercellular signaling (GJIC). Brook trout exposed to MWWE for 4 and 12 weeks showed altered testicular Cx levels at both ti me points. At 4 weeks there was a significant increase in both Cx43 and Cx31. At 12 weeks a decrease in Cx31 and an increase in Cx43 and Cx43.4 was observed. The presence of xenobiotics has been shown to target and disrupt Cx mRNA levels resulting in altered cellular functions. Similar results were reported in Spottail shiners living within the effluent plume of MWWE. Shiners displayed altered testicular Cx levels resulting in delayed spermatogenesis, increased vitellogenin levels, intersex characteristics and decreased sperm motility. MWWE has been shown to target Cxs in the testis causing an alteration in key signaling pathways. lnterestingly, few studies have examined the effects of MWWE on cellular signaling in the liver considering the important role it plays in xenobiotic metabolism.Xenobiotics can accumulate in the li ver if the complex signaling required to carry out the detoxification process is disrupted. GJIC plays an important role in the regulation of normal homeostatic processes in the liver including xenobiotic metabolism, bile secretion and glycogenolysis. Fish exposed to MWWE have demonstrated altered Cx expression levels and cellular signaling in the testis, it can be hypothesized that a similar disruption of GJIC could occur in the liver.There are presently no studies that have examined the effects of MWWE on the liver and currently only one Cx has been identified in the Iiver of fish, Cx43 in the zebrafish. ln the present study two Cxs were identified in the li ver of the brook trout, Cx43 and Cx30. When compared to mammalian Cxs, brook trout Cx43 was partially homologous to GJAl in the mouse and rat. Brook trout Cx30 shared sorne homology to mouse GJB6 and human Cx26. This is the first report of Cx30 in the liver of fish.After exposing brook trout for 12 weeks to MWWE, a large increase in Cx30 mRNA levels was observed at the two highest effluent concentrations. Similar results have been previously repmted in the testis and were shown to disrupt normal GJIC. There were no changes to Cx43 levels suggesting either individual contaminants targeting Cx43 were not present or the exposure period was too short for accumulation to occur.To further investigate the effects of MWWE on key signaling pathways in the liver, juvenile fathead minnow were exposed to 20 \% MWWE for 21 days. This study aimed to identify key signaling pathways affected by toxicants contained within the effluent mixture. Using a 15 208 eDNA microarray and pathway analysis software, three groups of genes, organized by function, were identified as being altered suggesting effects on various signaling pathways.},

	abstract = {Pollutant loadings in two watersheds, Mulberry and Catoma were assessed using the pollutant loading (PLOAD) model and model results were compared with those obtained from field sampling followed by laboratory analysis. The PLOAD model was used to determine water pollutants including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), orthophosphate (PO43-), nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-) in two watersheds, Mulberry and Catoma that are part of the Alabama River Basin. Results revealed that both Mulberry and Catoma watersheds had TN and TP values that exceeded the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limits set for rivers and streams. The TN and TP values were in the range of hypertrophic for lakes, and eutrophic for rivers. The PLOAD model results were in agreement with analytical results. We conclude that PLOAD is a valid model for determining pollutant loading in watersheds and provides a relatively faster and cheaper method of assessing impairment of watershed bodies compared to conventional methods.},

John Dolan
has worked on plankton ecology for over 25 years in systems ranging from eutrophic estuaries to the oligotrophic South Pacific. His research subjects are plankton protists, especially ciliates and dinoflagellates and research topics are biodiversity, species packing, and the relationships of form and function.


David Montagnes
is an aquatic ecologist. He combines modelling, laboratory, and field studies investigations into the ecophysiology and behaviour of protists- aquatic taxa forming a rich assemblage and occupying environmentally important niches. His research themes include the flow of energy and biomass in ecosystems and how abiotic and biotic properties and anthropogenic perturbations alter individuals, populations, and ecosystems.


Sabine Agatha
is a ciliate taxonomist. She has spent over 20 years describing and classifying ciliates mostly from marine habitats by combining morphologic and genetic approaches. The biodiversity, evolution, and biogeography of ciliates are her main research topics.




Wayne Coats
is a recently retired protistologist. His research encompasses ecology, morphology, life history, and taxonomy of dinoflagellates and ciliates. Parasitism and mixotrophy are featured themes of his work.




Diane Stoecker
is a biological oceanographer. Her laboratory and field projects focus on microzooplankton and their grazing on phytoplankton and role as prey for copepods and other mesozooplankton. Plastid retention and mixotrophy in ciliates and dinoflagellates and their effects on population dynamics and trophic transfer are other favorite research topics.},

	abstract = {What is a natural habitat? Who can define what is natural when species and ecosystems constantly change over time, with or without human intervention? When a polluted river or degraded landscape is restored from its damaged state, what is the appropriate outcome? With climate change now threatening greater disruption to the stability of ecosystems, how should restoration ecologists respond? Ecological Restoration and Environmental Change addresses and challenges some of these issues which question the core values of the science and practice of restoration ecology. It analyzes the paradox arising from the desire to produce ecological restorations that fit within an historical ecological context, produce positive environmental benefits and also result in landscapes with social meaning. Traditionally restorationists often felt that by producing restorations that matched historic ecosystems they were following nature's plans and human agency played only a small part in restoration. But the author shows that in reality the process of restoration has always been defined by human choices. He examines the development of restoration practice, especially in North America, Europe and Australia, in order to describe different models of restoration with respect to balancing ecological benefit and cultural value. He develops ways to balance more actively these differing areas of concern while planning restorations. The book debates in detail how coming global climate change and the development of novel ecosystems will force us to ask new questions about what we mean by good ecological restoration. When the environment is constantly shifting, restoration to maintain biodiversity, local species, and ecosystem functions becomes even more challenging. It is likely that in the future ecological restoration will become a never-ending, continuously evolving process.},

Environmental Archaeology by Elizabeth Reitz and Myra Shackley, updating the seminal 1981 text
Environmental Archaeology by Myra Shackley.  Rigorously detailed yet concise and accessible, this volume surveys the complex and technical field of environmental archaeology for researchers interested in the causes, consequences, and potential future impact of environmental change from the perspective of archaeology. Its coverage acknowledges the multiple disciplines involved in the field, expanding the possibilities for using environmental data from archaeological sites in enriching related disciplines and improving communication among them. Introductory chapters explain the processes involved in the formation of sites, introduce research designs and field methods and walk the reader through biological classifications before focusing on the various levels of biotic and abiotic materials found at sites, including:

Sediments and soils.
Viruses, bacteria, archaea, protists and fungi.
Bryophytes and vascular plants.
Wood, charcoal, stems, leaves and roots.
Spores, pollen and other microbotanical remains.
Arthropods, molluscs, echinoderms and vertebrates.
Stable isotopes, elements and biomolecules.
The updated
Environmental Archaeology is a major addition to the resource library of archaeologists,environmentalists, historians, researchers, policymakers--anyone involved in studying, managing, or preserving archaeological sites.First book to enable readers to learn about the wide range of materials and methods in environmental archaeology Helps to evaluate and discriminate among methods Continues in the tradition of the first edition, published by Plenum, while also bringing in advances and updates in the methodology of the field itself

	abstract = {Water acidification, temperature increases and changes in seawater salinity are predicted to occur in the near future. In such a global climate change (GCC) scenario, there is growing concern for the health status of both wild and farmed organisms. Bivalve molluscs, an important component of coastal marine ecosystems, are at risk. At the immunological level, the ability of an organism to maintain its immunosurveillance unaltered under adverse environmental conditions may enhance its survival capability. To our knowledge, only a few studies have investigated the effects of changing environmental parameters (as predicted in a GCC scenario) on the immune responses of bivalves. In the present study, the effects of both decreased pH values and increased temperature on the important immune parameters of two bivalve species were evaluated for the first time. The clam Chamelea gallina and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, widespread along the coast of the Northwestern Adriatic Sea, were chosen as model organisms. Bivalves were exposed for 7 days to three pH values (8.1, 7.7 and 7.4) at two temperatures (22 and 28°C). Three independent experiments were carried out at salinities of 28, 34 and 40 PSU. The total haemocyte count, Neutral Red uptake, haemolymph lysozyme activity and total protein levels were measured. The results obtained demonstrated that tested experimental conditions affected significantly most of the immune parameters measured in bivalves, even if the variation pattern of haemocyte responses was not always linear. Between the two species, C. gallina appeared more vulnerable to changing pH and temperature than M. galloprovincialis. Overall, this study demonstrated that climate changes can strongly affect haemocyte functionality in bivalves. However, further studies are needed to clarify better the mechanisms of action of changing environmental parameters, both individually and in combination, on bivalve haemocytes.},

Pour ce faire, les communautés benthiques échantillonnées au site contaminé et au site de référence, en 1973 et 2009, ont été comparées ainsi que les déformations au niveau des pièces buccales des larves de l'insecte Chironomus cucini (Diptera; Chironomidae) provenant de ces deux époques. Ces comparaisons ont révélé qu'il n'y avait pas de différence dans l'abondance des communautés de 1973 et 2009, sauf pour la famille des Tubificidae, et que les déformations chez les Chironomus cucini ont diminué depuis 1973, retrouvant ainsi un pourcentage d'individus déformés équivalent au site de référence. De plus, la composition de la famille des Chironomidae a été suivie dans le temps à l'aide de capsules céphaliques anciennes prélevées d'une carotte de sédiment, montrant que l'abondance des Tanytarsini et des Chironomini étaient moins élevées dans les strates contaminées par les huiles, mais que celle des Chironomus était plus élevée suite au déversement. Afin d'identifier la cause des changements temporels, nous avons mesuré la concentration des métaux dans les larves de C. cucini et les sédiments de la zone portuaire et d'un site de référence, ainsi que la concentration des huiles et graisses dans une carotte de sédiments de la zone du déversement. L'analyse des métaux nous a permis de constater que la concentration de cadmium chez les larves de la station 1 était significativement plus élevée qu'à la station de référence alors que la mesure de concentration des huiles et graisses nous a indiqué que les sédiments de 3,5 à 5,5 cm de profondeur présentaient de fortes concentrations d'huiles et graisses. Malgré le fait que l'huile est toujours présente dans les sédiments, nos données suggèrent que la communauté benthique de la zone portuaire de Parry Sound démontre des paramètres de population similaires aux populations références, probablement dû aux sédiments contaminés maintenant enfouis en dehors de la zone habitée par la plupart des invertébrés benthiques qui y habitent.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerThe purpose of this study was to assess the chronic impacts caused by a fuel oil spill, which occurred in 1950, on the benthic community of the port area of Parry Sound in Ontario. To do this, the benthic communities sampled at the contaminated site and at the reference site, in 1973 and 2009, were compared as well as the deformations in the mouthparts of the larvae of the insect Chironomus cucini (Diptera; Chironomidae) from these two eras. These comparisons revealed that there was no difference in the abundance of the communities of 1973 and 2009, except for the family Tubificidae, and that deformities in Chironomus cucini have decreased since 1973, thus recovering a percentage of deformed individuals equivalent to the reference site. In addition, the composition of the Chironomidae family was followed over time using ancient head capsules taken from a sediment core, showing that the abundance of Tanytarsini and Chironomini were lower in strata contaminated with oils, but that Chironomus oil was higher following the spill. In order to identify the cause of the temporal changes, we measured the concentration of metals in C. cucini larvae and sediments from the port area and a reference site, as well as the concentration of oils and fats in a carrot sediment from the spill area. The analysis of metals allowed us to observe that the concentration of cadmium in the larvae of station 1 was significantly higher than at the reference station, while the measurement of the concentration of oils and greases indicated to us that the sediments of 3.5 to 5.5 cm deep had high concentrations of oils and greases. Despite the fact that oil is still present in the sediments, our data suggest that the benthic community in the port area of Parry Sound exhibits similar population parameters to reference populations, likely due to contaminated sediments now buried outside the area. inhabited by most of the benthic invertebrates that live there.},

The prevalence of T. gondii  infection in southern sea otters approaches 80\% in some areas of the California coast, and causes significant sea otter mortality. Sea otters likely acquire the infection by ingestion of oocysts that are transported to the sea in watersheds. The objective of this study was to measure the acquisition, concentration, and retention of T. gondii oocysts by marine snails upon which sea otters prey. Trochid marine snails were experimentally exposed to T. gondii oocysts and microscopy was used to enumerate oocysts in tissue samples and feces from the exposed snails. The snails acquired oocysts, concentrated them, and retained them for up to ten days post-exposure. No naturally-acquired oocysts were detected in field-collected snails. These results suggest that marine snails might play an important role in the transmission of T. gondii to sea otters.},

	abstract = {The focus of this research is on the archaeological site known as Mutamba, situated on the northern slopes of the Soutpansberg, South Africa. The site was occupied during the 13th-century, a period during which northern South Africa, southern Zimbabwe, and eastern Botswana saw an increase in social complexity. In the heartland of the Mapungubwe polity, this process is characterized by the centralization of political, social and ritual power and authority by the elite members of society. Prior to this research, the communities that occupied the hinterland of Mapungubwe were cast as passive participants in this metanarrative. This dissertation critiques the assumption of dominance based solely on differences of complexity.    The extent of Mapungubwe dominance is mostly seen in the distribution of similar ceramic design over the region. This view, however, inherently assumes that similarity in ceramic design entails similarity of social process; hence the dynamics of power and control postulated for the Shashe-Limpopo River Confluence Area (SLCA) heartland are also thought to hold for the greater hinterland.    Excavations at Mutamba yielded multiple strands of information that suggest a reappraisal of the accepted view of hinterland society as inert and un-influential in regional dynamics. The presence of glass beads, gold, iron, copper, wild cotton cloth and marine shells imply that hinterland sites, like Mutamba, had access to a repertoire of artifacts traditionally considered to be restricted to elite consumption. The presence of gold from a hinterland site, suggests its use in both local and regional negotiations of power as well as to obtain other items through diverse trade networks. This indicates that hinterland communities had significant agentive power in shaping their participation and acceptance of exotic items.    Production activities at Mutamba point to a variety of different strategies and scales of organization. Evidence indicates that both shell-bead manufacture and cotton spinning took place within household settings. Shell beads were produced on a limited scale reflecting production to satisfy household needs with some surplus for trade purposes. Cotton spinning points to a much greater involvement in production by many members of the household. In contrast to both, metals were crafted by small groups of specialists, while smelting probably took place off-site. My research supports a view of hinterland communities actively exploiting ecological and environmental settings to engage with long distance trade networks. The picture that emerges is one of a society in which economic participation and power over vast hinterlands were variable. Regionally specific activities such as the production of spun fiber enabled dispersed communities to acquire long distance goods.    The contrasting patterns between the Mapungubwe hinterland and heartland suggest that hierarchy formation in the heartland co-occurred with the horizontal expansion of social relations through networking strategies in the hinterland. Evidence from Mutamba shows that political power at Mapungubwe was counterpoised between maintaining generalized subsistence production and more intensive efforts to acquire trade goods. Centralization and control of exotic items may have existed in tension with the necessity to maintain networks of interaction in order to obtain long distance items. In the Mapungubwe heartland, there was a clear emphasis on centralizing processes and the accumulation of material wealth. However, at settlements in the hinterland, the distribution of prestige items suggests that hinterland communities were able to use their position to acquire trade goods usually considered restricted to elite spheres of society in the heartland. The heartland's interaction with hinterland communities was one of forging networks, with a greater emphasis on wealth in people than control over the economy of the hinterland. At a regional scale, this resulted in a society with weak vertical control and a fluctuating, flexible system of horizontal integration. Centralization in the SLCA was distinguished from a heterogeneous and varied hinterland occupied by foragers, herders, and farming communities. The Mapungubwe hinterland was a region where class and power was expressed in a diversity of ways.},

	doi = {10.3390/md9122729},
	abstract = {Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes with wide geographic distribution that can produce secondary metabolites named cyanotoxins. These toxins can be classified into three main types according to their mechanism of action in vertebrates: hepatotoxins, dermatotoxins and neurotoxins. Many studies on the effects of cyanobacteria and their toxins over a wide range of aquatic organisms, including invertebrates and vertebrates, have reported acute effects (e.g., reduction in survivorship, feeding inhibition, paralysis), chronic effects (e.g., reduction in growth and fecundity), biochemical alterations (e.g., activity of phosphatases, GST, AChE, proteases), and behavioral alterations. Research has also focused on the potential for bioaccumulation and transferring of these toxins through the food chain. Although the herbivorous zooplankton is hypothesized as the main target of cyanotoxins, there is not unquestionable evidence of the deleterious effects of cyanobacteria and their toxins on these organisms. Also, the low toxin burden in secondary consumers points towards biodilution of microcystins in the food web as the predominant process. In this broad review we discuss important issues on bioaccumulation and the effects of cyanotoxins, with emphasis on microcystins, as well as drawbacks and future needs in this field of research.},

Les rongeurs représentent actuellement l'un des ordres les plus diversifiés des mammifères. Répartis sur tous les continents, ils possèdent des niches écologiques très variées. Ils constituent un monde où se retrouvent des espèces « sympathiques » comme l'écureuil ou la marmotte, « effrayantes » comme les rats, ou tout simplement parfaitement inconnues comme nombre de campagnols. Ils peuvent être source de dommages importants ou vecteurs de maladies. En France ils se répartissent en 6 familles (21 genres et 31 espèces). Tout d'abord décrits dans leur rapport avec l'environnement puis avec l'homme, ils sont ensuite présentés dans une monographie illustrée. Cette nouvelle édition fait une synthèse unique et des plus récentes sur le sujet., elle précise les notions développées dans certains chapitres de la précédente édition : santé publique, régulation des populations. Elle actualise la réglementation (lutte et protection). Elle tient compte des nouvelles connaissances acquises sur plusieurs espèces (introductions récentes, nouvelles espèces...)},

	abstract = {Background 
Fragmented distribution ranges of species with little active dispersal capacity raise the question about their place of origin and the processes and timing of either range fragmentation or dispersal. The peculiar distribution of the land snail Tudorella sulcata s. str. in Southern France, Sardinia and Algeria is such a challenging case.
Methodology
Statistical phylogeographic analyses with mitochondrial COI and nuclear hsp70 haplotypes were used to answer the questions of the species' origin, sequence and timing of dispersal. The origin of the species was on Sardinia. Starting from there, a first expansion to Algeria and then to France took place. Abiotic and zoochorous dispersal could be excluded by considering the species' life style, leaving only anthropogenic translocation as parsimonious explanation. The geographic expansion could be dated to approximately 8,000 years before present with a 95\% confidence interval of 10,000 to 3,000 years before present.
Conclusions
This period coincides with the Neolithic expansion in the Western Mediterranean, suggesting a role of these settlers as vectors. Our findings thus propose that non-domesticated animals and plants may give hints on the direction and timing of early human expansion routes.},

The third edition includes an updated and expanded synthesis of feedback and interactions between insects and their environment. This updated material and a new chapter on applications of insect ecology to social and environmental issues effectively demonstrates how evolutionary and ecosystem approaches complement each other, with the intent of stimulating further integration of these approaches in experiments that address insect roles in ecosystems. Effective management of ecosystem resources depends on evaluation of the complex, often complementary, effects of insects on ecosystem conditions, as well as insect responses to changing conditions.

Stable isotope analyses tracked sources of carbon and nitrogen in larval striped bass diets. The estuarine copepod Eurytemora affinis was the most important prey. It and the freshwater cladoceran Bosmina longirostris dominated diets of striped bass larvae.  Bosmina  was relatively important in 2007. Larvae grew faster in 2007 than in 2008 and growth was fastest within and up-estuary of the ETM and salt front.

Here we analyse a worldwide database of pest species assemblages to generate lists of the top 100 insect pests most likely to establish in the United States and each of its 48 contiguous states. For the United States as a whole, all of the top 100 pest species have already established. Individual states however tend to have many more 'gaps' with most states having at least 20 species absent from their top 100 list. For all but one state, every exotic pest species currently absent from a state's top 100 can be found elsewhere in the contiguous United States. We conclude that the immediate threat from known invasive insect pests is greater from within the United States than without. Our findings have potentially significant implications for biosecurity policy, emphasizing the need to consider biosecurity measures beyond established national border interventions.},

This paper reviews the nature of waste and the impacts of a range of wastes on biodiversity. It demonstrates that the ecological impacts of wastes are pervasive and widespread. Typically, the wastes associated with the production of goods and services have a greater impact on biodiversity than the wastes generated during the consumption of those goods and services. There is consequently an onus on consumers to minimise wasteful consumption and to choose products and services with less embodied waste. There is also an onus on society to establish a system that makes producers and consumers accountable for the wastes embodied in the goods and services that they trade. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {The arminacean nudibranch Janolus fuscus (family Zephyrinidae) is found in rocky intertidal habitats along the northeast Pacific coast. Adult  J. fuscus are conspicuous from April to October but absent in the early winter at two sites, North Cove and Fossil Pt., in the Coos Bay region of Oregon. Over four years of intertidal surveys at these sites, the density of J. fuscus peaked with the abundance of their bryozoan prey, Bugula pacifica and Tricellaria circumternata , in spring and summer, while adult absence in winter was correlated with strong winter storms. To describe the timing of development and determine the life cycle of J. fuscus, embryos and larvae were reared in the laboratory and examined with light, scanning electron, and confocal microscopy. Larvae reared in the lab and juveniles collected from the field were monitored to quantify growth. Janolus fuscus exhibited typical spiral cleavage and hatched as planktotrophic veligers that grew for over a month before they reached competency, settled, and metamorphosed on their prey, B. pacifica. Juvenile growth was rapid, and adults reached maximum sizes of over 50 mm before dying. These demographic and developmental studies suggest that J. fuscus is a subannual species with a life span of approximately five months. Janolus fuscus is often infected with an endoparasitic copepod, Ismaila belciki. In the field, prevalence of I. belciki increased with host density and size. The distribution of I. belciki was weakly aggregated in the host population. The large female parasite was generally found in the anterior portion of the host hemocoel, and one or more dwarf males were typically associated with each female. Infected J. fuscus  produced significantly smaller egg masses with fewer larvae than did uninfected individuals. Infection did not influence growth rate but did cause decreased survival in older nudibranchs. To examine the life cycle of  I. belciki, naupliar larvae were reared in the lab and incubated with potential hosts. Additionally, copepodid stages were described from dissected  J. fuscus collected from the field. Ismaila belciki has a least three planktotrophic naupliar stages and four copepodid stages in its life cycle.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-10-268},
	abstract = {Background 
The grape powdery mildew fungus, Erysiphe necator, was introduced into Europe more than 160 years ago and is now distributed everywhere that grapes are grown. To understand the invasion history of this pathogen we investigated the evolutionary relationships between introduced populations of Europe, Australia and the western United States (US) and populations in the eastern US, where E. necator is thought to be native. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that populations of E. necator in the eastern US are structured based on geography and Vitis host species.
Results
We sequenced three nuclear gene regions covering 1803 nucleotides from 146 isolates of E. necator collected from the eastern US, Europe, Australia, and the western US. Phylogeographic analyses show that the two genetic groups in Europe represent two separate introductions and that the genetic groups may be derived from eastern US ancestors. Populations from the western US and Europe share haplotypes, suggesting that the western US population was introduced from Europe. Populations in Australia are derived from European populations. Haplotype richness and nucleotide diversity were significantly greater in the eastern US populations than in the introduced populations. Populations within the eastern US are geographically differentiated; however, no structure was detected with respect to host habitat (i.e., wild or cultivated). Populations from muscadine grapes, V. rotundifolia, are genetically distinct from populations from other Vitis host species, yet no differentiation was detected among populations from other Vitis species.
Conclusions
Multilocus sequencing analysis of the grape powdery mildew fungus is consistent with the hypothesis that populations in Europe, Australia and the western US are derived from two separate introductions and their ancestors were likely from native populations in the eastern US. The invasion history of E. necator follows a pattern consistent with plant-mediated dispersal, however, more exhaustive sampling is required to make more precise conclusions as to origin. E. necator shows no genetic structure across Vitis host species, except with respect to V. rotundifolia.},

	abstract = {This dissertation concerns a widely recognized natural area, New York's Adirondack Park, that serves both as an international model for conservation and as a context for persistent conflict over natural resources, space, wealth and esthetics. It employs narrative inquiry as a method to examine the sources and the function of narratives or stories explaining the history and the present status of social groups in the Park. Narrative theorists maintain that we borrow from such socially circulating narratives to craft our own identities, and then repeat them until we believe them, almost without regard for the factual basis in history or science. The dissertation follows the progress of the author, a professor of environmental studies at a small Adirondack college, as he delves into the formation of his own Adirondack identity and values while traveling with his family from the state capital, Albany, deep into the Adirondack interior. The interdisciplinary approach includes a critical overview of environmental history as it pertains to class and conflict in the Adirondack Park, an exposition of narrative epistemology, interviews with four subjects, a praxis-oriented exploration of environmental virtue, and targeted memoir. This narrative dissertation is at once an intellectual, philosophical, personal and spatial voyage toward a set of answers, or more clearly articulated questions, concerning how one regional community struggles toward finding a satisfactory balance between nature and culture. The author identifies a set of themes that help to bound and conclude the inquiry: Landside and Lakeside, Camps and Camping and the Virtues of the Caretaker.},

Allometric studies have shown that individual growth rate is inversely related to body size across a broad spectrum of organisms that vary greatly in size. Fewer studies have documented such patterns within species. No data exist directly documenting the influence of colony size on growth rate for microscopic, colonial organisms.
Methodology/Principal Findings
To determine if similar negative relationships between growth rate and size hold for colonial organisms, we developed a technique for measuring the growth of individual colonies of a bloom-forming, toxic cyanobacterium, Microcystis aeruginosa using microscopy and digital image analysis. For five out of six genotypes of M. aeruginosa isolated from lakes in Michigan and Alabama, we found significant negative relationships between colony size and growth rate. We found large intraspecific variation in both the slope of these relationships and in the growth rate of colonies at a standard size. In addition, growth rate estimates for individual colonies were generally consistent with population growth rates measured using standard batch culture.
Conclusions/Significance
Given that colony size varies widely within populations, our results imply that natural populations of colonial phytoplankton exist as a mosaic of individuals with widely varying ecological attributes (since size strongly affects growth rate, grazing mortality, and migration speed). Quantifying the influence of colony size on growth rate will permit development of more accurate, predictive models of ecological interactions (e.g., competition, herbivory) and their role in the proliferation of harmful algal blooms, in addition to increasing our understanding about why these interactions vary in strength within and across environments.},

	abstract = {The Game of Conservation is a brilliantly crafted and highly readable examination of nature protection around the world.Twentieth-century nature conservation treaties often originated as attempts to regulate the pace of killing rather than as attempts to protect animal habitat. Some were prompted by major breakthroughs in firearm techniques, such as the invention of the elephant gun and grenade harpoons, but agricultural development was at least as important as hunting regulations in determining the fate of migratory species. The treaties had many defects, yet they also served the goal of conservation to good effect, often saving key species from complete extermination and sometimes keeping the population numbers at viable levels. It is because of these treaties that Africa is dotted with large national parks, that North America has an extensive network of bird refuges, and that there are any whales left in the oceans. All of these treaties are still in effect today, and all continue to influence nature-protection efforts around the globe.Drawing on a wide variety of primary and secondary sources, Mark Cioc shows that a handful of treaties-all designed to protect the world's most commercially important migratory species-have largely shaped the contours of global nature conservation over the past century. The scope of the book ranges from the African savannahs and the skies of North America to the frigid waters of the Antarctic.},

It is also recognised that vessels play an extensive role in invasive species propagation as ballast waters transport potentially threatening larvae. It is then crucial to develop new AF solutions combining advances in marine chemistry and topography, in addition to a knowledge of marine biofoulers, with respect to the marine environment. This review presents the recent research progress made in the field of new non-toxic AF solutions (new microtexturing of surfaces, foul-release coatings, and with a special emphasis on marine natural antifoulants) as well as the perspectives for future research directions.},

	abstract = {L'émission des éléments du groupe platine (ÉGP), soit le Pd, le Pt et le Rh, par les convertisseurs catalytiques des automobiles fait l'objet d'une préoccupation relativement récente de la part de la çommunauté scientifique. Au cours des trois dernières décennies, l'adoption, par plusieurs pays, de lois sur la qualité de l'air, a contribué à l'augmentation de l'utilisation de ces dispositifs et, par conséquent, à une croissance de la demande mondiale pour les ÉGP. Bien que ces métaux soient présents naturellement à de très faibles concentrations, ils ont été retrouvés en concentrations importantes aux abords des routes. On a également observé des concentrations croissantes en ÉGP dans le temps dans des écosystèmes éloignés de tous réseaux routiers; Les ÉGP ont notamment été détectés, dans divers compartiments environnementaux tels que le sol, les sédiments, l'eau et la neige. Cependant, le comportement de ces métaux dans l' environnement est encore peu connu. La présence des ÉGP dans l'environnement a mené à l'étude de leurs effets potentiels sur les organismes vivants. Ainsi, nous savons maintenant qu'ils sont susceptibles d'être accumulés par les espèces animales et végétales, tant aquatiques que terrestres, et qu' ils peuvent également être toxiques.Dans ce contexte, nous nous sommes d'abord attardés à quantifier les concentrations d'ÉGP dans l'eau de deux écosystèmes aquatiques en milieu urbain pour donner une idée du niveau de contamination dans la région de Québec. Dans un deuxième temps, afin d'améliorer la compréhension du transport des ÉGP, nous avons cherché à évaluer l'influence que peut avoir l'épandage de sels de voirie sur leur mobilisation. Ainsi, nous avons procédé à l'échantillonnage de deux cours d'eau et de quatre exutoires pluviaux situés à proximité de réseaux routiers achalandés, récepteurs de grandes quantités de déglaçant durant la période hivernale. Finalement, des expériences de·toxicité sur l'espèce phytoplanctonique Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ont permis de déterminer quelles gammes de concentrations en ÉGP ont un effet inhibiteur sur la croissance algale.Comme nous l'avions anticipé, les concentrations en ÉGP présentes dans l'eau de deux rivières de Québec et dans quatre exutoires pluviaux ont grandement varié tout au long de l'année. Alors que les concentrations sont parfois sous les limites de détection, elles peuvent atteindre, au site de la rivière Lorette, des valeurs de 95 ± 24 ng L-l , 14 ± 1 ng L-l et 9 ± 14 ng L-l pour le Pd, le Pt et le Rh, respectivement. Au site de la rivière Duberger, nous avons mesuré des concentrations allant jusqu'à 833 ± 114 ng L-l, 8 ± 2 ng L-l et 175 ± 4 ng L-l pour le Pd, le Pt et le Rh, respectivement. Aux deux sites, le Pd s'est avéré être présent en plus fortes concentrations que le Pt et le Rh. En parallèle des analyses de métaux, nous avons aussi mesuré les concentrations en chlorures afin d'établir une corrélation entre celles-ci et les concentrations en ÉGP observées. Bien que, dans certains cas, une relation semble se dessiner entre ces deux paramètres, les analyses statistiques n'ont pas montré de corrélation significative. La concentration en chlorures ne serait pas le seul paramètre à suivre pour expliquer la mobilisation de ces métaux.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerThe emission of platinum group elements (PGE), Pd, Pt and Rh, from automotive catalytic converters is a relatively recent concern in the scientific community. Over the past three decades, the adoption of clean air laws by several countries has contributed to the increase in the use of these devices and, consequently, to a growth in global demand. for PGEs. Although these metals are naturally present at very low concentrations, they have been found in high concentrations near roads. Increasing PGE concentrations over time have also been observed in ecosystems far from any road networks; In particular, PGEs have been detected in various environmental compartments such as soil, sediment, water and snow. However, the behavior of these metals in the environment is still little known. The presence of PGEs in the environment has led to the study of their potential effects on living organisms. Thus, we now know that they are likely to be accumulated by animal and plant species, both aquatic and terrestrial, and that they can also be toxic.In this context, we first focused on quantifying the concentrations of PGEs in the water of two aquatic ecosystems in an urban environment to give an idea of the level of contamination in the Quebec region. Secondly, in order to improve the understanding of the transport of PGEs, we sought to evaluate the influence that the spreading of road salts can have on their mobilization. Thus, we sampled two watercourses and four stormwater outlets located near busy road networks, which receive large quantities of de-icer during the winter period. Finally, toxicity experiments on the phytoplankton species Chlamydomonas reinhardtii made it possible to determine which ranges of PGE concentrations have an inhibiting effect on algal growth.As we had anticipated, the PGE concentrations present in the water of two Quebec rivers and in four stormwater outlets varied greatly throughout the year. While the concentrations are sometimes below the detection limits, they can reach, at the Lorette River site, values of 95 ± 24 ng L-l , 14 ± 1 ng L-l and 9 ± 14 ng L-l for Pd, Pt and the Rh, respectively. At the Duberger River site, we measured concentrations up to 833 ± 114 ng L-l, 8 ± 2 ng L-l and 175 ± 4 ng L-l for Pd, Pt and Rh, respectively. At both sites, Pd turned out to be present in higher concentrations than Pt and Rh. In parallel with the metal analyses, we also measured the chloride concentrations in order to establish a correlation between these and the observed PGE concentrations. Although, in some cases, a relationship seems to emerge between these two parameters, the statistical analyzes did not show a significant correlation. The chloride concentration would not be the only parameter to follow to explain the mobilization of these metals.},

	abstract = {Studies of Marenzelleria species were often hampered by identification uncertainties when using morphological characters only. A newly developed PCR/RFLP protocol allows a more efficient discrimination of the three species Marenzelleria viridis, Marenzelleria neglecta and Marenzelleria arctia currently known for the Baltic Sea. The protocol is based on PCR amplification of two mitochondrial DNA gene segments (16S, COI) followed by digestion with restriction enzymes. As it is faster and cheaper than PCR/sequencing protocols used so far, the protocol is recommended for large-scale analyses. The markers allow an undoubted determination of species irrespective of life stage or condition of the worms in the samples. The protocol was validated on about 950 specimens sampled at more than 30 sites of the Baltic and the North Sea, and on specimens from populations of the North American east coast. Besides this test we used mitochondrial DNA sequences (16S, COI, Cytb) and starch gel electrophoresis to further investigate the distribution of the three Marenzelleria species in the Baltic Sea. The results show that M. viridis (formerly genetic type I or M. cf. wireni) occurred in the Öresund area, in the south western as well as in the eastern Baltic Sea, where it is found sympatric with M. neglecta. Allozyme electrophoresis indicated an introduction by range expansion from the North Sea. The second species, M. arctia, was only found in the northern Baltic Sea, where it sometimes occurred sympatric with M. neglecta or M. viridis. For Baltic M. arctia, the most probable way of introduction is by ship ballast water from the European Arctic. There is an urgent need for a new genetic analysis of all Marenzelleria populations of the Baltic Sea to unravel the current distribution of the three species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Reviews:

"This is a useful text. It provides a good level of detail so that the beginner in this area can appreciate what palaeolimnology can (and cannot) achieve. It goes beyond the simple introduction to provide a detailed understanding of how techniques can be applied ... This is a different take on the usual pollution text and would be of great use to those wishing to understand more from sedimentary records."

	abstract = {Urban Ecology is the study of ecosystems that include humans living in cities and urbanizing landscapes. It is an emerging, interdisciplinary field that aims to understand how human and ecological processes can coexist in human-dominated systems and help societies with their efforts to become more sustainable. It has deep roots in many disciplines including sociology, geography, urban planning, landscape architecture, engineering, economics, anthropology, climatology, public health, and ecology. Because of its interdisciplinary nature and unique focus on humans and natural systems, the term "urban ecology" has been used variously to describe the study of humans in cities, of nature in cities, and of the coupled relationships between humans and nature. Each of these research areas is contributing to our understanding of urban ecosystems and each must be understood to fully grasp the science of Urban Ecology. Therefore, in Urban Ecology: An International Perspective on the Interaction Between Humans and Nature, we introduce students and practitioners of urban ecology to its roots, bases, and prospects by way of a diverse collection of historical and modern foundational readings. The editors are urban ecologists from the United States, Italy, and Germany who together view these readings as a fair representation of the importance of both natural and social sciences to Urban Ecology. 
This book presents important papers in the field of Urban Ecology that both set the foundations for the discipline and to illustrate modern approaches, from a variety of perspectives and regions of the world. The editors do this by reprinting important publications, filling gaps in the published literature with a few targeted original works, and translating several key works originally published in German. The aim of this collection is to provide students, practitioners, and professionals with a rich background in some of the core facets of Urban Ecology.

	abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the purple sea urchin immune system is more complex than previously believed. Analysis of the sea urchin genome reveals a number of gene families with homology to vertebrate innate immune receptors, in addition to lectin and complement homologues. An additional immune-related gene family, 185/333, which lacks known homologues in other species, is characterized by extraordinary diversity and is strongly upregulated in response to immunological challenge. In addition to point mutations, alignment of the sequences requires the insertion of large gaps that define elements, the presence or absence of which defines element patterns. The genes are small ({\textless}2kb) with only two exons, the second of which encodes the majority of the element pattern. The genes contain a variety of types of repeats that allow for multiple alignments. The repeats within the genes, in addition to di- and trinucleotide repeats flanking the genes and their close linkage are thought to facilitate frequent recombination among members of the gene family, thereby increasing diversity. Although a large number of genes with unique sequences have been isolated, each individual element within the genes is composed of a limited number of similar, but distinct sequences. The mosaic distribution of these sequences among the 185/333 genes also suggests frequent recombination within this gene family. Analysis of  185/333 genes isolated from coelomocyte and sperm genomic DNA indicates that the diversification is not limited to coelomocytes. Comparisons between the 185/333 gene vs. message sequences isolated from individual animals reveals that very few element patterns or nucleotide sequences are identified from both genes and messages. The messages exhibit a strong cytidine to uridine substitution pattern when compared to the genes, suggesting a post-transcriptional RNA editing mechanism that mimics cytidine deaminase activity. Thus, the diversity of the 185/333 sequences is the result of frequent recombination among the genes that is promoted by various repeats and the structure of the gene cluster, plus putative post-transcriptional editing of the messages. The 185/333 system represents a novel mechanism for generating immune diversity in an invertebrate, and further supports the concept that all organisms require immunological diversity to survive.},

	abstract = {The Field Manual of Techniques in Invertebrate Pathology is designed to provide background and instruction on a broad spectrum of techniques and their use in the evaluation of entomopathogens in the field. The second edition of the Field Manual provides updated information and includes two additional chapters and 12 new contributors. The intended audience includes researchers, graduate students, practitioners of integrated pest management (IPM), regulators and those conducting environmental impact studies of entomopathogens. Although it can function as a stand alone reference, the Field Manual is complementary to the laboratory oriented Manual of Techniques in Insect Pathology and to comprehensive texts in insect pathology. 
The Editors have structured the 40 chapters of the Field Manual into 10 sections to provide the tools required for planning experiments with entomopathogens and their implementation in the field. The basic tools include chapters on the theory and practice of application of microbial control agents (MCAs) (Section I), statistical considerations in the design of experiments (Section II), and three chapters on application equipment and strategies (Section III). Section IV includes individual chapters on the major pathogen groups (virus, bacteria, microsporidia, fungi, and nematodes) and special considerations for their evaluation under field conditions. This section sets the stage for subsequent chapters on the impact of naturally occurring and introduced exotic pathogens and inundative application of MCAs. Twenty-three chapters on the application and evaluation of MCAs in a wide variety of agricultural, forest, domestic and aquatic habitats comprise Section VII of the Field Manual. In addition to insect pests, the inclusion of mites and slugs broadens the scope of the book. Most of the chapters in this section include step by step instructions on handling of inoculum, design of fieldexperiments and experimental plots and application and assessment of efficacy of dozens of MCAs. Several of these chapters include supplementary techniques and media for conducting follow up laboratory studies for confirmation of infection, determination of persistence, etc. The three final chapters include: special consideration for evaluation of Bt transgenic plants (Section VIII); resistance to insect pathogens and strategies to manage resistance (Section IX); and guidelines for evaluating effects of MCAs on nontarget organisms (Section X).
Due to uncertainty regarding the future availability of organophosphate and other conventional chemical insecticides, MCAs will play increasingly important roles in IPM. The Field Manual will provide researchers and IPM practitioners with techniques and practical guidance for the study and optimal use of MCAs in a variety of settings.Provides researchers, IPM practitioners, and graduate students with techniques and practical guidance for the study and optimal use of invertebrate pathogens in a variety of settings Covers many topics including the theory and practice of microbial insecticide application, experimental design, ground based and aerial application equipment, overviews of the individual of pathogen groups, classical biological control, transgenic plants, resistance to insect pathogens, and guidelines for evaluating pathogens on non-target organisms The only book on the market that offers diverse theoretical and practical aspects of application and evaluation of invertebrate pathogens for control of invertebrate pests (insects, mites, mollusks) in a variety of agroecosystems, in public health, and against ornamental, urban and veterinary pests Provides step by step procedures written by an international group of experts for the use of invertebrate pathogens in pest control and furnishes the tools required for planning experiments and for the implementation of control programs},

	abstract = {Sheltered coastal areas, such as those along bays and estuaries, experience land loss from erosion and sea level rise much like ocean beaches. Owners of property along sheltered coasts often reinforce their shoreline with bulkheads and other structures to prevent erosion. However, this construction alters the coastal ecosystem, causing changes that threaten landscapes, public access, recreational opportunities, natural habitats, and fish populations. At the request of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and the Cooperative Institute for Coastal and Estuarine Environmental Technology, this report examines the impacts of shoreline management on sheltered coasts. The report calls for a regional management approach that considers the environmental impacts that could accumulate if hard structures are permitted on a site by site basis. In addition the report recommends changing the current permitting system to remove the default preference for bulkheads and similar structures and allow more flexibility to encourage use of more ecologically beneficial erosion-control methods, such as planting of marshes.
Like ocean beaches, sheltered coastal areas experience land loss from erosion and sea level rise. In response, property owners often install hard structures such as bulkheads as a way to prevent further erosion, but these structures cause changes in the coastal environment that alter landscapes, reduce public access and recreational opportunities, diminish natural habitats, and harm species that depend on these habitats for shelter and food.
Mitigating Shore Erosion Along Sheltered Coasts recommends coastal planning efforts and permitting policies to encourage landowners to use erosion control alternatives that help retain the natural features of coastal shorelines.},

	abstract = {This is the first guide yet produced to the amphibians and reptiles of New York State, a large and heavily populated state that hosts a surprisingly diverse and interesting community of amphibians and reptiles. This much needed guide to the identification, distribution, natural history and conservation of the amphibians and reptiles of New York State fill a long-empty niche. The book is the first comprehensive presentation of the distributional data gathered for the New York State Amphibian and Reptile Atlas project. With more than 60,000 records compiled from 1990-1999, this extraordinary and up-to-date database provides a rich foundation for the book. This volume provides detailed narratives on the 69 species native to New York State. With a heavy emphasis on conservation biology, the book also includes chapters on threats, legal protections, habitat conservation guidelines, and conservation case studies. Also included are 67 distribution maps and 62 pages of color photographs contributed by more than 30 photographers. As a field guide or a desk reference The Amphibians and Reptiles of New York State is indispensable for anyone interested in the vertebrate animals of the Northeast, as well as students, field researchers and natural resource professionals.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacteria of the Baltic Sea have multiple effects on organisms that influence the food chain dynamics on several trophic levels. Cyanobacteria contain several bioactive compounds, such as alkaloids, peptides, and lipopolysaccharides. A group of nonribosomally produced oligopeptides, namely microcystins and nodularin, are tumor promoters and cause oxidative stress in the affected cells. Zooplankton graze on cyanobacteria, and when ingested, the hepatotoxins (nodularin) decrease the egg production of, for example, copepods. However, the observed effects are very variable, because many crustaceans are tolerant to nodularin and because cyanobacteria may complement the diet of grazers in small amounts. Cyanobacterial toxins are transferred through the food web from one trophic level to another. The transfer rate is relatively low in the pelagic food web, but reduced feeding and growth rates of fish larvae have been observed. In the benthic food web, especially in blue mussels, nodularin concentrations are high, and benthic feeding juvenile flounders have been observed to disappear from bloom areas. In the littoral ecosystem, gammarids have shown increased mortality and weakening of reproductive success under cyanobacterial exposure. In contrast, mysid shrimps seem to be tolerant to cyanobacterial exposure. In fish larvae, detoxication of nodularin poses a metabolic cost that is reflected as decreased growth and condition, which may increase their susceptibility to predation. Cyanobacterial filaments and aggregates also interfere with both hydromechanical and visual feeding of planktivores. The feeding appendages of mysid shrimps may clog, and the filaments interfere with prey detection of pike larvae. On the other hand, a cyanobacterial bloom may provide a refuge for both zooplankton and small fish. As the decaying bloom also provides an ample source of organic carbon and nutrients for the organisms of the microbial loop, the zooplankton species capable of selective feeding may thrive in bloom conditions. Cyanobacteria also compete for nutrients with other primary producers and change the nitrogen (N) : phosphorus (P) balance of their environment by their N-fixation. Further, the bioactive compounds of cyanobacteria directly influence other primary producers, favoring cyanobacteria, chlorophytes, dinoflagellates, and nanoflagellates and inhibiting cryptophytes. As the selective grazers also shift the grazing pressure on other species than cyanobacteria, changes in the structure and functioning of the Baltic Sea communities and ecosystems are likely to occur during the cyanobacterial bloom season.

The Great Lakes are also currently plagued with invasive species such as zebra mussels. Invasive species and bacteria are affecting the animals that make their habitat in and around the lakes, including loons, other birds and fish, said Miller.},

	abstract = {The extent of stratification and vertical mixing in the water column (7-11 m deep) was investigated over an offshore reef in the western basin of Lake Erie. Measurements reveal that the vertical transport of oxygen and heat is controlled by the complex interaction of several physical mechanisms. Generally, when the wind speed (W) was {\textgreater}7 m.s{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum} and the air was cooler than the water (T{\textasciicircum}sub air{\textasciicircum} {\textless} T{\textasciicircum}sub w{\textasciicircum}), the water column was well mixed due to turbulent mixing. However, when W {\textless} 7 m.s{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum} ({\textasciitilde}65\% of the summer), turbulence was too weak to overcome the stratification and mix the water column. An analysis of 25 years of meteorological data revealed that a period of 4.5 ± 1.9 days of calm, warm weather (W {\textless} 7 m.s{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum} and T{\textasciicircum}sub air{\textasciicircum} {\textgreater} T{\textasciicircum}sub w{\textasciicircum}) occurs every year. Results indicate that there is strong probability of hypoxia due to stratification (i.e., when diffusivities {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}sup -6{\textasciicircum} m{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum}.s{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}) and sediment oxygen demand (i.e., 0.1-1.0 g.m{\textasciicircum}sup -2{\textasciicircum}.day{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}) during these periods. The environmental implications of stratification to water quality and its effects on benthic organisms, such as the burrowing mayfly (Hexagenia spp.), require further considerations in large temperate lakes and basins that are sufficiently shallow that there is no permanent seasonal stratification.

	abstract = {Municipal effluents are complex mixtures of compounds such as heavy metals, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, and micro-organisms and are released in aquatic ecosystems. The purpose of this study was to verify whether changes in metallothioneins (MT) were associated with the accumulation of labile metals in tissue of freshwater mussels exposed to the dispersion plume of a major municipal effluent. Mussels were placed in experimental cages deployed at sites 1.5 km upstream, 8 km downstream and 12 km downstream of the outfall of a major, primary-treated municipal effluent in the St. Lawrence River (Québec, Canada). Mussels were analysed for MT and labile zinc levels in their gonads, gills and digestive glands. Lipogenic enzyme (isocitrate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and arachidonic acid cyclooxygenase (COX) activities were also measured in gonad and gill tissues. Although MT was induced in all the tissues examined, the results showed that labile zinc levels were significantly reduced in gill and gonad tissues, with an increase observed only at the 12 km downstream site in the digestive gland. COX activity was readily induced in gills and gonads. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity was reduced at both downstream sites, but isocitrate dehydrogenase activity was signifcantly induced at the farthest (12 km) site. Analysis of covariance revealed that MT levels in gills were more influenced by COX activity than with distance in the dispersion plume and was negatively correlated with labile zinc levels. In conclusion, MT induction was inversely related to the levels of labile zinc but positively so with the inflammation biomarker COX. Hence, the induction of MT in mussels exposed to the municipal effluent of a large city appears to be associated with either inflammatory processes or as compensation for the loss of labile essential metals. We propose that the simple and complimentary parameters of labile zinc and COX evaluations be used to link MT induction with divalent heavy metal exposure in environmental studies dealing with various type of contaminants in such complex contaminant mixture effluents.},

	abstract = {Although the study of lakes has traditionally focused on pelagic production pathways, recent stable isotope and diet evidence indicates that benthic algal production is an important contributor to fish production. This has led to the suggestion that energy may be more efficiently passed along benthic food chains relative to their pelagic counterparts. To test this idea, we combined stable isotope based assessments of energy flow pathways with estimates of pelagic- and benthic-based primary and secondary production in Castle Lake, California. Approximately 50\% of whole-lake primary production and 30\% of whole-lake secondary production occurred in benthic habitats. Stable carbon isotopes and dietary data indicated that fish were predominantly supported by benthic (63\%) and terrestrial (24\%) secondary production. Ecological efficiencies (algal production / invertebrate production) were low in Castle Lake ({\textless}3\%), though zoobenthic production was more efficiently passed to fish than was zooplankton production. The larger size of benthic prey relative to pelagic prey may affect fish prey selection and foraging efficiency, resulting in differences in ecological efficiency between pelagic and benthic trophic pathways.

	abstract = {Climate change is likely to act as a multiple stressor, leading to cumulative and/or synergistic impacts on aquatic systems. Projected increases in temperature and corresponding alterations in precipitation regimes will enhance contaminant influxes to aquatic systems, and independently increase the susceptibility of aquatic organisms to contaminant exposure and effects. The consequences for the biota will in most cases be additive (cumulative) and multiplicative (synergistic). The overall result will be higher contaminant loads and biomagnification in aquatic ecosystems. Changes in stratospheric ozone and corresponding ultraviolet radiation regimes are also expected to produce cumulative and/or synergistic effects on aquatic ecosystem structure and function. Reduced ice cover is likely to have a much greater effect on underwater UV radiation exposure than the projected levels of stratospheric ozone depletion. A major increase in UV radiation levels will cause enhanced damage to organisms (biomolecular, cellular, and physiological damage, and alterations in species composition). Allocations of energy and resources by aquatic biota to UV radiation protection will increase, probably decreasing trophic-level productivity. Elemental fluxes will increase via photochemical pathways. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

And like the mussels, they hitched a ride to North America in the bilge water of ocean-going freighters.                 Not surprisingly the tenacious hitchhiker is taking a toll on its new environment. As the goby numbers are exploding, native species of sculpins and darters are disappearing. The pugnacious invaders feed on small fish and on the eggs of other species of fish. They'll even attack a sunfish nest when the male is guarding it.                 The amount of zebra mussels that they consume is insignificant in the long run, but the goby diet of mussels results in the transfer of contaminants from the mussels to several species of sports fish.},

	abstract = {Effects of invasive species are often extrapolated to whole systems based on small-scale, short-term, and (or) single-system studies. For example, previous laboratory studies and in-lake cage experiments suggest that invasive crayfish Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus reduce macrophyte and snail abundance in north temperate lakes, and snapshot lake surveys provide supporting evidence. Still, these impacts have not been demonstrated in multiple whole lakes over time. Thus, in summer of 2003, we resurveyed benthic invertebrates and macrophytes in lakes originally surveyed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources in the late 1930s. Our multilake survey supports the macrophyte results from small-scale and comparative studies: macrophyte species richness and abundance declined significantly in invaded lakes relative to uninvaded lakes. We next conducted a laboratory seed-bank study to examine the potential for macrophyte restoration in a lake occupied by rusty crayfish for at least 15 years. Only two macrophyte species (Najas flexilis and Chara spp.) germinated from sediments from the invaded lake compared with eight species from reference sediments. This suggests that invaded lakes may have depauperate seed banks and that restoration of invaded macrophyte communities may require manual planting, even if crayfish could be removed.

	abstract = {Human transport by land, sea and air has increased exponentially through time in intensity, paralleling rises in population, prosperity and rates of technological change. Transport has considerable ecological effects, many of them detrimental to environmental sustainability. This volume brings together international experts from a variety of disciplines to review the ecological effects and their causes in terms of road, rail, ship and aircraft transport. The contributors have different attitudes and agendas. Some are ecologists, some planners, others social scientists. Focus ranges from identification of threats and amelioration of damaging effects through to future design of transport systems to minimize environmental degradation. Some chapters consider restricted areas of the globe; others the globe itself. Views encompass deep pessimism and cautious optimism. 
Uniquely, the volume considers transport effects in all environments. This is the first book that attempts to discuss the relationship between human transport and all ecosystems. It appeals not only to the specialist environmentalist by picking out novel topics, but also to anyone involved in transport issues as it tackles the issues from an historical perspective, encompassing the past, present and future of the effects of human transport.Considers transport effects in all environments Discusses future designs of transport systems to minimize environmental degradation Describes methods of amelioration of the damaging effects of transport on the environment},

Since no gobies have been found upstream of the infested mouth of the Pefferlaw River, that's almost certainly how they got there, [Beth Brownson] says. In August, the province banned the use of gobies as bait. Fishermen caught with one face penalties ranging from confiscation of their equipment to fines up to an improbable \$500,000, and jail time.                 Invasive species help each other out. Gobies, for example, eat zebra mussels. So, where mussels go, the big-headed fish are eager to follow. Unfortunately, Brownson says, while gobies enjoy a diet that includes mussels, they don't consume enough to control the population.},

	abstract = {We examined the settlement and recruitment of the softshell clam (Mya arenaria L., 1758) in two tidally contrasted regimes in eastern Canada. The Bay of Fundy (strong tides) and the Northumberland Strait (weak tides) were used to describe the distribution of planktonic larvae and early settlers. These distributions were compared with those of juvenile and adult forms observed in the same intertidal habitats. Results showed that the abundances of planktonic stages were the same at all tidal levels except in one site of the Bay of Fundy. Early settlers varied according to a site × intertidal level interaction. Juveniles and adults also varied according to a similar interaction, most being in the upper intertidal level. Simple linear regressions demonstrated that no relationship exists between the number of planktonic larvae and the number of early settlers. The only significant relationship observed was the one between the number of juveniles (1-5 mm size class) and the number of adults in one of the Northumberland Strait sites. Our results show, through the high spatial resolution and wide range of spatial scales covered by the study, that the dominant regional tidal regime does not have an effect on the distribution of the softshell clam. Local hydrodynamic effects appear to drive the intertidal distribution of the softshell clam life-cycle stages. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

It touches upon the intriguing idea that trophic interactions drive patterns and dynamics at different levels of biological organization: dynamics in species composition, dynamics in population life-history parameters and abundances, and dynamics in individual growth, size and behavior. These dynamics are shown to be strongly interrelated governing food web structure and stability and the role of populations and communities play in ecosystem functioning. Dynamic Food Webs not only offers over 100 illustrations, but also contains 8 riveting sections devoted to an understanding of how to manage the effects of environmental change, the protection of biological diversity and the sustainable use of natural resources. Dynamic Food Webs is a volume in the Theoretical Ecology series.  Relates dynamics on different levels of biological organization: individuals, populations, and communities Deals with empirical and theoretical approaches Discusses the role of community food webs in ecosystem functioning Proposes methods to assess the effects of environmental change on the structure of biological communities and ecosystem functioning Offers an analyses of the relationship between complexity and stability in food webs},

	abstract = {Most freshwater fishes have short pelagic early life stages. Lake Michigan presents an interesting scenario for yellow perch (Perca flavescens), a species with a long pelagic larval stage that may not be well adapted to lakes with an expansive pelagic environment and extensive offshore transport. We investigated the possibility that early life stages of yellow perch were transported well offshore from their nearshore spawning grounds and explored whether food resources were more or less favorable offshore. To determine the extent to which pelagic age-0 yellow perch moved offshore, we sampled at multiple scales ranging from local ({\textless}2 km) to across the lake ({\textgreater}120 km). Evidence of offshore movement by fish larvae occurred at each scale. Yellow perch larvae were quickly transported offshore from nearshore spawning sites and remained in the offshore pelagia to sizes of at least 30 mm. Zooplankton density was greater offshore than nearshore, suggesting that pelagic age-0 yellow perch find improved food resources offshore compared with their nearshore spawning sites. Currents operating at oceanographic scales likely influenced the offshore movement of pelagic age-0 yellow perch in Lake Michigan. These currents, coupled with prey availability for pelagic age-0 individuals, may influence the recruitment success of this species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

It's one of literally dozens of exotic creatures introduced into Lake Huron, most likely from ballast water dumped by ocean-going ships.


Ontario's Lake Huron fish management supervisor Dave Reid expects to begin talks soon with four sport fishing groups about potential cuts in the number of fish they plant on the Canadian side. In recent years, Ontario groups have stocked between 500,000 and 700,000 Chinook annually. There was a voluntary 20 per cent stocking reduction in 1999 following an earlier decline in alewife population.


Michigan has moved more quickly than Ontario to make adjustments to biological shifts in Lake Huron. For one thing, much of the research into recent lake changes originates with U.S. Coast Guard and Geological Survey fish sampling conducted annually in Lake Huron.},

	abstract = {Manganese is an element of great importance in the life cycle of plants and animals. For example, it plays an essential role as an activator of various enzymatic systems such as isoenzymes of superoxide dismutase. Freshwater Unionidae concentrate relatively large amounts of manganese in their tissues, but little is known about the physiological role of this metal. The aim of this research is to acquire a better knowledge of the role of manganese in molluscs which accumulate large amounts of this metal and in those with low manganese concentrations. As manganese is one of the metals present in the superoxide molecule, the possible relationship between manganese concentration in the soft tissues of molluscs and the antioxidant capacity of the metal can usefully be tested. To this end two species of molluscs were analysed: Unio pictorum mancus (Lamellibranchia, Unionidae), which is very rich in manganese, and Viviparus ater (Gastropoda, Prosobranchia) which has a low manganese content. The adults of both species were analysed for manganese concentration by ICP, and for antioxidant capacity as RAC (Relative Antioxidant Capacity) by a superoxide dismutase method. The results clearly demonstrate the active role played by manganese against free radicals and consequently the important role of the metal in protecting Unio against oxidative stress. The low concentration of manganese in Viviparus may be the result of the effective excretion of this metal, as was found for ruthenium.},

	abstract = {Modern food web studies are typically conducted from a trophic dynamic perspective that focuses on combined roles of top-down and bottom-up forces in regulating food web structure. Recognition of spatial food web subsidies in diverse ecosystems highlights the importance of energy flow as a foundation for understanding trophic dynamics. Here, we consider how different energy flow configurations might affect trophic dynamics in north-temperate lakes. A literature review revealed that littoral piscivores exert top-down control on prey fishes. In contrast, analysis of littoral predator diets indicated extensive omnivory and heavy reliance on zoobenthic prey. We explored this uncoupling between trophic dynamics (piscivores regulate prey fish) and energy flow (zoobenthos in piscivore diets) using a biomass dynamic model. This model compared top-down impacts of a piscivore on prey fishes under two scenarios: consumption of prey fish only and consumption of prey fish plus zoobenthos. The model predicted that elimination of zoobenthivory leads to a 50\% reduction in piscivore standing stock and concomitant 2.5-fold increase in prey fish abundance (i.e., zoobenthivory plays a key role in mediating pelagic top-down control). These results highlight the role of benthic-pelagic linkages in regulating trophic dynamics and underscore the value of whole-ecosystem approaches to the study of food webs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Le platine (Pt) et le palladium (Pd) font partie des composantes actives des convertisseurs catalytiques automobiles installés sur toutes les nouvelles voitures depuis 1975 au Canada et aux États-Unis et depuis les années 1990 en Europe. Ce dispositif s'avère très efficace pour réduire les émissions automobiles nocives comme les NOx, le CO et les HC. Cependant, il est maintenant reconnu que les convertisseurs catalytiques sont responsables d'une contamination en Pt et en Pd des milieux urbains et des zones à proximité de grandes autoroutes. Les connaissances actuelles sur les émissions automobiles de Pt et de Pd indiquent un risque potentiel pour l'humain et l'environnement, mais elles sont incomplètes et ne permettent pas d'en faire une évaluation éclairée.La découverte récente de la contamination en Pt et en Pd de neiges et de glaces au Groenland, à des dizaines de milliers de kilomètres de toute activité humaine significative, a initié un débat sur le transport des émissions des convertisseurs catalytiques automobiles sur de grandes distances par voie atmosphérique. Dans la présente recherche, nous avons prélevé des carottes de sédiment dans deux lacs du Bouclier canadien (Tantaré et Vose) isolés de toute source directe de contamination en vue d'établir la chronologie du dépôt atmosphérique de Pt et de Pd. Les lacs ont été sélectionnés pour simplifier l'interprétation des profils: petit lac de tête, petit rapport de surface du bassin versant sur surface du lac, pas de bouleversements majeurs au cours des 100 dernières années sur le bassin versant et faible activité benthique au site d'échantillonnage. Le lac Tantaré est situé à 40 km au nord de la ville de Québec dans une réserve écologique et le lac Vose est localisé dans le parc Aiguebelle à 25 km de la ville de Rouyn-Noranda, site de la fonderie Home (Noranda Inc.).Nous avons choisi de déterminer le Pt et le Pd par spectrométrie de masse avec plasma à couplage inductif couplée à la dilution isotopique (ICP-IDMS) puisque cette technique offre des limites de détection permettant de mesurer leur niveau naturel. Des interférences spectrales ont cependant compliqué les analyses de sédiments: l'oxyde d'hafnium sur le Pt; le cadmium et les oxydes d'yttrium et de zirconium sur le Pd. Vu l'importance de ces interférences, nous avons utilisé deux méthodes de contrôle des interférences pour attester la robustesse de nos données. Une partie de la solution de chaque échantillon de sédiment était analysée directement et les contributions des interférences au signal de l'élément d'intérêt étaient soustraites (méthode directe) tandis que l'autre partie de la solution subissait une extraction sur une résine échangeuse d'anions (méthode avec extraction) avant l'analyse ICP-IDMS. Nous avons choisi la résine Aliquat 336/C18 pour sa capacité reconnue d'enlèvement de Hf, pour son élution ne demandant qu'un petit volume d'éluant (possibilité de pré concentration de l'élément d'intérêt) et pour son potentiel d'extraire le Pd et d'enlever ses interférences dans les mêmes conditions que pour le Pt. Préalablement à l'analyse des échantillons de sédiment, tout le processus analytique des deux méthodes a été validé par des essais sur des solutions synthétiques et des matériaux de référence certifiés (BCR-723, une poussière de route et GPt-7, un sol). Nous avons constaté que la résine Aliquat 336/C18 permet d'extraire le Pt et le Pd efficacement tout en enlevant la majorité de Hf, Y et Zr. Cependant, la résine ne permet pas d'enlever le Cd qui interfère avec le dosage du Pd.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

This device is very effective in reducing harmful automotive emissions such as NOx, CO and HC. However, it is now recognized that catalytic converters are responsible for Pt and Pd contamination of urban environments and areas near major highways. Current knowledge of automobile emissions of Pt and Pd indicates a potential risk for humans and the environment, but it is incomplete and does not allow an informed assessment to be made.The recent discovery of Pt and Pd contamination of snow and ice in Greenland, tens of thousands of kilometers from any significant human activity, has initiated a debate on the transport of emissions from automotive catalytic converters over long distances by atmospheric route. In this research, we collected sediment cores from two lakes in the Canadian Shield (Tantaré and Vose) isolated from any direct source of contamination in order to establish the chronology of the atmospheric deposition of Pt and Pd. The lakes were selected to simplify the interpretation of the profiles: small headwater lake, small watershed surface area to lake surface ratio, no major upheavals in the last 100 years on the watershed and low benthic activity at the site sampling. Tantaré Lake is located 40 km north of Quebec City in an ecological reserve and Vose Lake is located in Aiguebelle Park 25 km from the city of Rouyn-Noranda, site of the Home smelter (Noranda Inc.) .We chose to determine Pt and Pd by mass spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma coupled to isotopic dilution (ICP-IDMS) since this technique offers detection limits allowing their natural level to be measured. Spectral interferences, however, complicated sediment analyses: hafnium oxide on Pt; cadmium and yttrium and zirconium oxides on Pd. Given the importance of these interferences, we used two interference control methods to attest to the robustness of our data. A portion of the solution from each sediment sample was analyzed directly and the interference contributions to the signal of the element of interest were subtracted (direct method) while the other portion of the solution was extracted on a d-exchange resin. anions (extraction method) before ICP-IDMS analysis. We chose the Aliquat 336/C18 resin for its recognized ability to remove Hf, for its elution requiring only a small volume of eluent (possibility of pre-concentration of the element of interest) and for its potential for extract Pd and remove its interferences under the same conditions as for Pt. Prior to the analysis of the sediment samples, the entire analytical process of the two methods was validated by tests on synthetic solutions and certified reference (BCR-723, road dust and GPt-7, soil). We have found that Aliquat 336/C18 resin extracts Pt and Pd efficiently while removing the majority of Hf, Y and Zr. However, the resin does not make it possible to remove the Cd which interferes with the determination of the Pd.},

	abstract = {Toxin-producing blooms of cyanobacteria in most freshwater systems have posed a serious global threat throughout the world. Vincent et al. (2004) have developed a set of algorithms that employ LANDSAT 7 ETM+ data and LANDSAT 5 TM data to map cyanobacterial blooms in fresh water lakes from space by quantitatively mapping phycocyanin, the pigment most uniquely associated with cyanobacterial blooms. However, the LANDSAT TM sensor has a 16-day revisit cycle and a spatial resolution of 28.5 m, whereas the SeaWiFS sensor has a daily revisit cycle and a coarse spatial resolution of 1.1 km for LAC (local area coverage) and 4.5 km for GAC (global area coverage). Hence, the SeaWiFS sensor can be applied with higher temporal frequency and can be used to document large-scale changes in the region, due to its larger synoptic coverage. In this research an algorithm has been developed for detecting incipient cyanobacterial blooms with SeaWiFS data that is also based on phycocyanin pigment. An empirical method for atmospheric correction, ratio normalization, has been applied to SeaWiFS data after additive offset of the sensor and atmospheric haze have been corrected by dark object subtraction, which is primarily aimed at making two input images similar with respect to radiometric qualities. It has been observed that ratio normalization becomes more important for coarse resolution sensors such as SeaWiFS (due to their synoptic coverage) than that of sensors like LANDSAT TM.   The results were compared to the LANDSAT TM results and observed that SeaWiFS model predicts phycocyanin concentration about as well as the LANDSAT TM spectral ratio model. To ensure that we are mapping phycocyanin and not chlorophyll a (Chl a), a model for Chl a has been developed from SeaWiFS data. The Chl a model was then applied to the same dates of SeaWiFS data to which the phycocyanin model was applied and the two models results were compared, which brought to view that no correlation exists between phycocyanin and Chl a concentration. This cyanobacterial bloom algorithm with SeaWiFS Data can be used to investigate inter and intra-annual variability of cyanobacterial blooms in the entire Lake Erie. The algorithm could serve as a tool for early stage monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms, thereby assisting future assessment of water quality and the aquatic ecosystem health of large fresh water lakes around the globe.},

	abstract = {The crustacean zooplankton communities in Lakes Michigan and Huron and the central and eastern basins of Lake Erie have shown substantial, persistent changes since the invasion of the predatory cladoceran Bythotrephes in the mid-1980s. A number of cladoceran species have declined dramatically since the invasion, including Eubosmina coregoni, Holopedium gibberum, Daphnia retrocurva, Daphnia pulicaria, and Leptodora kindti, and overall species richness has decreased as a result. Copepods have been relatively unaffected, with the notable exception of Mesocyclops edax, which has virtually disappeared from the lakes. These species shifts have for the most part been consistent and equally pronounced across all three lakes. Responses of crustacean species to the Bythotrephes invasion do not appear to be solely a consequence of size, and it is likely that other factors, e.g., morphology, vertical distribution, or escape responses, are important determinants of vulnerability to prdation. Our results indicate that invertebrate predators in general, and invasive ones in particular, can have pronounced, lasting effects on zooplankton community structure. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Rees, who is executive director of the Federation of Ontario Cottagers' Associations (FOCA), has watched as zebra mussels ruined a lake next to his. So far, only a few mussels have been discovered in Lake Kasshabog, but Rees remains concerned.                 When it comes to the fixation many cottagers seem to have with lawns, Rees agrees with other experts that "benign neglect" is probably the best route to follow when "landscaping." Fertilizing the lawn and using pesticides are big no-no's, as most chemicals will make their way into the lake, causing untold damage by increasing the nutrient load and adding toxins. "I go to the cottage not to bring nature into submission, but to relax and enjoy it," Rees says. He calls it "the hammock approach" to cottaging.                 PWCs, the high-powered, whining fun-craft that have divided lake associations and embittered neighbourly relations on countless lakes and rivers across Canada, are a sticky problem for groups such as FOCA, which represent a wide range of cottagers with varying ideas of what fun on the water entails. It was the third time [Mira Spivak] had introduced the bill or ones like it, only to see them killed by election calls. This time, Spivak was encouraged to see theproposed legislation supported by Conservatives and the NDP, but says she doesn't think the Liberal majority would have passed it into law. Undeterred, she says she'll introduce it a fourth time, and remains adamant that PWCs are among the worst polluters because of the way they are driven.},

	abstract = {As one of the world's great natural treasures, the Great Lakes have also served in recent decades as an early warning system for many emerging environmental problems. In the early twenty-first century, as the Lakes face unprecedented challenges, we need to revisit both the wonder of the Lakes and the perils plaguing them, and to take action to protect this majestic ecosystem. 
Dave Dempsey weaves the natural character and phenomena of the Great Lakes and stories of the schemes, calamities, and unusual human residents of the Basin with the history of their environmental exploitation and recovery. Contrasting the incomparable beauty and complexity of the Lakes, and the poetry, folklore, and citizen action they have inspired, with the disasters that short-sighted human folly has inflicted on the ecosystem, Dempsey makes this history both engaging and relevant to today's debates and decisions.
Underlying the neglectful treatment of the Lakes are two irreconcilable and faulty human assumptions: that the Lakes are a system so big that human beings cannot do great harm to it, and that the Lakes are a resource that can be bent to the will of humankind. Dempsey finds evidence that, despite great changes in the laws governing the Lakes and public attitudes toward them in the last fifty years, government policy and institutions are still dominated by these dangerous attitudes.
A central theme of
On the Brink is that citizens, who have displayed an increasing sense of commitment to the Lakes and a growing sense of place, must challenge their leaders to reform Great Lakes institutions. While everything from large-scale water exports to global climate change looms in the future of the Lakes, single-purpose solutions do not suffice--no more than a Band- aid would on a gaping wound. Dempsey shows that it is necessary to create a governing system that reflects the realities of life "on the ground" in communities and that taps into the passion and determination of citizens to protect these treasures.},

La larve de l'éphémère Hexagenia limbata a été choisie comme biomoniteur en raison de sa présence dans un grand nombre de lacs et de rivières,de sa facilité d'identification, de son comportement sédentaire qui permet une représentation de la contamination locale et de sa tolérance à de fortes concentrations en métaux traces.Pour que l'utilisation d'un biomoniteur soit efficace, il est avantageux de connaître son temps de réponse à un changement dans les concentrations d'un métal et ce, idéalement dans la nature. De cette façon, on peut mieux interpréter les concentrations de métaux mesurés chez le biomoniteur et ainsi prédire son temps de réponse lors d'un changement des concentrations de ce métal dans l'environnement.Pour mesurer les taux d'échange de cadmium (Cd) dans la nature, nous avons effectué une transplantation réciproque de larves de l'éphémère Hexagenia limbata entre deux rivières localisées au Québec, soit dans le nord du Québec (Rivière Allard), soit en Abitibi (Rivière Colombière), et possédant des concentrations différentes en Cd. Les mesures des gains et des pertes de Cd se sont effectuées sur une période de 36 jours dans deux organes, le tractus digestif et le corps, et dans plusieurs fractions cellulaires(isolées par centrifugation différentielle).Dans le cas des larves transplantées vers la rivière Allard, nous avons observé un accroissement de la concentration en Cd dans le temps, une accumulation principale du Cd dans le tractus intestinal et une localisation du Cd dans la fraction subcellulaire des peptides et des protéines stables à la chaleur. Dans le cas des larves transplantées vers la rivière Colombière, nous avons observé une diminution des concentrations en Cd dans le tractus intestinal et que la perte en Cd s'est manifestée principalement dans la fraction des protéines stables à la chaleur. Si la fraction des protéines stables à la chaleur contient majoritairement de la métallothionéine, comme montré chez d'autres espèces aquatiques, on peut supposer qu'une augmentation de la part de Cd fixée à cette fraction relativement aux autres, serait liée à une synthèse accrue de métallothionéines, donc à la mise en place d'un système de protection et/ou détoxication. De plus, ces résultats suggèrent que la métallothionéine soit rapidement recyclée chez cet organisme.Les changements dans les concentrations en Cd les plus notables ont été remarqués dans les deux premières semaines de la transplantation, ce qui suggère que H. limbata soit un bon biomoniteur pour les changements en Cd à court terme, contrairement à d'autres invertébrés comme les bivalves d'eau douce, pour qui les échanges de Cd avec leur environnement sont plus lents. De plus, un modèle mathématique à un compartiment explique avec succès les données obtenues lors de la transplantation et les constantes obtenues à partir du modèle sont similaires à celles mesurées dans une étude antérieure effectuée en laboratoire avec Hexagenia rigida.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

In this way, we can better interpret the concentrations of metals measured in the biomonitor and thus predict its response time during a change in the concentrations of this metal in the environment.To measure cadmium (Cd) exchange rates in nature, we performed a reciprocal transplant of larvae of the mayfly Hexagenia limbata between two rivers located in Quebec, either in northern Quebec (Rivière Allard), or in Abitibi (Rivière Colombière), and having different concentrations of Cd. Measurements of gains and losses of Cd were carried out over a period of 36 days in two organs, the digestive tract and the body, and in several cellular fractions (isolated by differential centrifugation).In the case of larvae transplanted to the Allard River, we observed an increase in Cd concentration over time, a main accumulation of Cd in the intestinal tract and a localization of Cd in the subcellular fraction of peptides and proteins stable at the heat. In the case of larvae transplanted to the Colombière River, we observed a decrease in Cd concentrations in the intestinal tract and that the loss of Cd was manifested mainly in the fraction of heat-stable proteins. If the fraction of heat-stable proteins mainly contains metallothionein, as shown in other aquatic species, it can be assumed that an increase in the share of Cd bound to this fraction relative to the others, would be linked to increased synthesis. of metallothioneins, therefore to the establishment of a protection and/or detoxification system. Furthermore, these results suggest that metallothionein is rapidly recycled in this organism.The most notable changes in Cd concentrations were noted within the first two weeks of transplantation, suggesting that H. limbata is a good biomonitor for short-term Cd changes, unlike other invertebrates such as freshwater bivalves, for which Cd exchanges with their environment are slower. In addition, a one-compartment mathematical model successfully explains the data obtained during transplantation and the constants obtained from the model are similar to those measured in a previous laboratory study with Hexagenia rigida.},

	abstract = {Carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes ([delta]{\textasciicircum}sup 13{\textasciicircum}C and [delta]{\textasciicircum}sup 15{\textasciicircum}N, respectively) were measured for locally abundant primary producers, detritus, aquatic invertebrates, and fish in backwater lakes of two large floodplain rivers in an effort to understand patterns of energy dependence and trophic structure within these habitats. We observed trophic enrichment values for {\textasciicircum}sup 15{\textasciicircum}N that were within the ranges observed for other aquatic systems but were often considerably lower than the 3.4[per thousand] typically assumed in stable isotope studies. Production based on benthic and terrestrial material, combined with planktonic production for larval fish, appears to be an important energy source supporting consumers in backwater lakes of large floodplain rivers. Our isotopic data challenge the conventional wisdom that macrophytes are centrally involved in supplying carbon to aquatic consumers in shallow lakes and that food webs in most lakes are sustained almost exclusively by carbon fixed by phytoplankton.

"We have to allow the lakes to heal," Nalbone told The Tribune. "The lakes are ecosystems. They will sooner or later stabilize, but they'll probably be different than the lakes we knew 100 years ago because so many species have been reduced or extirpated and so many new species have entered... The lakes will find a stable state if we stop stressing them out."                 All of those invasive species made their way into the Great Lakes as stowaways in the ballast of ocean-going ships over the past century. Only about seven per cent of ships using the lakes come from international locations. It's those ships that brought the invaders.},

Back in 1819, when the Erie Canal first linked the Hudson River with Lake Ontario, sea lampreys- fierce predators that attach to their victims and suck out their body fluids- wriggled into the lake from their natural home in the Atlantic Ocean. The opening of the Welland Canal gave them a route to Lake Erie and the upper lakes, where they nearly wiped out lake trout and whitefish.                 Second, in deeper parts of the lakes, mussels and other bottom- dwellers ingest the botulism toxin. They're not affected by it. But they, in turn, are eaten by the round goby, a small fish that arrived around 1990 in ballast water and now, in Lake Erie alone, numbers in the billions.},

	abstract = {A synthesis of present understanding of the structure of the geographic ranges of species, which is a core issue in ecology and biogeography with implications for many of the environmental issues presently facing humankind. -;No species occurs everywhere. Indeed, the majority are absent from most places, and where they do occur they are usually quite rare. Gaston discusses the structure of these distributions - the structure of the geographic ranges of species. Gaston is particularly concerned with the factors that determine the limits to a species' geographic range, how the sizes of those ranges vary, and patterns in that variation. Also considered are the distribution of individuals amongst those sites where a species does occur and what determines that distribution, and some of the practical implications of all these. Both in a pure and applied context, ecologists need a broader perspective on their subject matter than has historically prevailed. This book provides one such perspective. A must have book for any researchers and graduate students studying macroecology, biogeography and conservation biology. -;Overall, the book's structure is straightforward and easy to follow, facilitating the ease with which it can be used as a reference. This volume, however, can also comfortably be read cover to cover, as the writing style is very clear, with almost seamless transitions from one topic to another. It will certainly serve as an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the structure or dynamics of geographic ranges, as it greatly surpasses previous works on these topics in itsthoroughness and clarity. It should do much to advance the field of biogeography, and to provide a context for conservation in a world where the distribution, size, and internal structure of geographic ranges are ever changing. - The Quarterly Review of Biology;... a very stimulating book. The range of cases and sources is impressive: it gives the study weight and provides us with one of the few detailed treatments of this subject. It should appeal to a wide audience. Educators will find ideas about range in one text (and have enough material to demonstrate the key ideas irrespective of location). For those studying the distribution of species this book is an excellent introduction. - TEG News;...evaluating this book brings only positive superlatives to mind. The synthesis flows with ease as if all the links amongst various theories, concepts, and analytical methods were known and obvious. It is a comprehensive review of what is state-of-the-art in the study and understanding of geographic ranges. - Ecology},

Even though the CFIA erected signs on major arteries warning people not to transport firewood out of the quarantined zone, officials at Rondeau, Wheatley and Pinery provincial parks stopped hundreds of Essex County campers trying to bring a total of 250 bags of firewood from the quarantine zone to the parks over the Victoria Day weekend.

Along with the zebra mussel, the round-eyed goby, the Eurasian ruffle and the spiny and fishhook waterfleas are rewriting the book of life in the lakes. They are linked to the startling decline in walleye stocks, an expanding dead zone in the middle of Lake Erie, and the spread of disease that is killing tens of thousands of birds each year. For example, another native of the Black Sea, the round eyed goby, is literally eating the future of bass stocks in the lakes.

We investigated these temporal patterns by fitting a dynamic von Bertalanffy model and length-weight relationship with time-varying parameters to mean length- and weight-at-ages (ages 1-7) from annual surveys (1965-1999). We modeled yearling length, asymptotic size (L[infinity]), and the parameters of a power relationship between mean weight and mean length ([alpha] and [beta]) as changing slowly over time using a random walk model. The Brody growth coefficient (k) was modeled as a linear function of L[infinity] with year-specific random deviations. Our results support a positive relationship between L[infinity] and k, indicating that under conditions supporting larger asymptotic lengths, individuals approach the asymptote more rapidly. We explored the relationship between year-specific growth parameters and indices of lakewide bloater abundance and found evidence of density-dependent growth. However, in the most recent years, L[infinity] and yearling length have remained low in Lake Michigan despite low bloater abundances, suggesting the occurrence of a fundamental shift in the food web.},

This is the conclusion reached by Canada's Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development, Johanne Gelinas, in the sixth annual report to be issued by the Commissioner's Office. The Report's main conclusion is quite clear. The federal government is not investing enough -- enough of its human and financial resources; its legislative, regulatory, and economic powers; or its political leadership -- to fulfill its sustainable development commitments. The failure of the government to meet its commitments has serious consequences. It presents potential risks to humans' health and the environment and it costs billions of dollars in damage to the environment. The Report contains six chapters comprised of five audits and a final chapter on the part concerned citizens can play in the process. Chapters one to four focus on the federal government's responsibility to protect the health and well-being of Canadians.},

Conservation Medicine defines this new discipline. It examines ecological health issues from various standpoints, including the emergence and resurgence of infectious disease agents; the increasing impacts of toxic chemicals and hazardous substances; and the health implications of habitat fragmentation and degradation and loss of biodiversity. It will provide a framework to examine the connections between the health of the planet and the health of all species and challenge practitioners and students in the health sciences and natural sciences to think about new, collaborative ways to address ecological health concerns.},

They cost more than \$100 billion per year in crop and timber losses plus the expense of herbicides and pesticides. And this figure does not include the costs of invasions in less intensively managed ecosystems such as wetlands. 

Nonindigenous Plants and Plant Pests examines this growing problem and offers recommendations for enhancing the science base in this field, improving our detection of potential invaders, and refining our ability to predict their impact.
The book analyzes the factors that shape an invader's progress through four stages: arriving through one of many possible ports of entry, reaching a threshold of survival, thriving through proliferation and geographic spread, and ultimate impact on the organism's new environment. The book also reviews approaches to predicting whether a species will become an invader as well as the more complex challenge of predicting and measuring its impact on the environment, a process involving value judgments and risk assessment.
This detailed analysis will be of interest to policymakers, plant scientists, agricultural producers, environmentalists, and public agencies concerned with invasive plant and plant pest species.},

The historical roles that power relations and the land ethic have played in land use and land health are identified. The article concludes by identifying he need for community action based in a land ethic to maintain a healthy forest through sustainable use.

At one Lake Ontario check station at the depth of 150 metres, the number of diporeia has dropped to 302 per square metre last spring from 2,800 per square metre five years ago.                 Lake Erie was the first to lose its diporeia. In Lake Ontario, the loss was noticed at the Bay of Quinte, about a year after zebra mussels appeared. The diporeia gradually disappeared near the shore and as time went on, they progressively disappeared out into deeper water.                 Diporeia feed on diatoms - minute algae that are prevalent in the spring and fall in deep, cold water and contain oil rather than starch. There's competition between diporeia and zebra mussels for this food, but there seems to be enough to go around.},

	abstract = {La forte croissance de l'activité industrielle au 20e siècle, en Occident en particulier, a contribué à la détérioration de la qualité de l'environnement à plusieurs égards. Ainsi, les zones portuaires constituent aujourd'hui des régions souvent fortement contaminées. Le dragage et l'enfouissement des sédiments contaminés deviennent alors des problèmes très délicats auxquels il convient de trouver des solutions à la fois simples et peu coûteuses. C'est dans cette optique qu'a été développé un procédé de traitement des sédiments contaminés par l'utilisation de technologies minéralurgiques. Ainsi, dans le cadre de ce travail les performances respectives d'une cellule et d'une colonne de flottation ont été évaluées, optimisées à l'aide de la méthode de Taguchi puis comparées afin de déterminer la technologie la plus appropriée pour l'enlèvement des hydrocarbures pétroliers de sédiments contaminés du port de Montréal. Notons que dans le cadre de la réalisation de ces objectifs, une modélisation mathématique a été développée afin de prédire les performances d'une cellule de flottation en mode continu à partir de résultats en mode fournée.Tout d'abord, notons que parmi les variables qui ont été étudiées, celle qui semble avoir le plus d'influence sur les performances autant des cellules que des colonnes est le pourcentage de solides dans la pulpe sur une base massique. Ainsi, dans les conditions optimales, des coefficients d'efficacité et d'enlèvement respectivement de 57,0 \% et 76,3 \% ont été atteints en colonne alors qu'en cellule un coefficient d'efficacité de 70,4 \% et un coefficient d'enlèvement de 83,2 \% ont été mesurés. Notons que dans tous les cas les concentrations en hydrocarbures pétroliers des rejets étaient inférieures au critère C du Ministère de l'Environnement et de la Faune du Québec (3500 ppm) et que la masse du concentré représentait au maximum 10 \% de la masse de l'alimentation. Bien qu'à prime abord les résultats des essais en cellule semblent supérieurs, notons que ceux-ci ont été réalisés en mode fournée alors que les essais en colonne ont été réalisés en mode continu. Ainsi, sur la base de la modélisation, il semble qu'au contraire les colonnes soient légèrement supérieures aux cellules. L'utilisation des colonnes de flottation est donc suggérée afin de retirer des hydrocarbures pétroliers de sédiments portuaires contaminés.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerThe strong growth of industrial activity in the 20th century, in the West in particular, contributed to the deterioration of the quality of the environment in several respects. Thus, port areas today are often highly contaminated regions. The dredging and burial of contaminated sediments then become very delicate problems for which it is necessary to find solutions that are both simple and inexpensive. It is with this in mind that a process for treating contaminated sediments was developed using mineral processing technologies. Thus, within the framework of this work the respective performances of a cell and a flotation column were evaluated, optimized using the Taguchi method and then compared in order to determine the most appropriate technology for the removal hydrocarbons from contaminated sediments in the Port of Montreal. Note that in the context of achieving these objectives, a mathematical model was developed to predict the performance of a flotation cell in continuous mode from results in batch mode.First of all, note that among the variables that have been studied, the one that seems to have the most influence on the performance of both cells and columns is the percentage of solids in the pulp on a mass basis. Thus, under optimal conditions, efficiency and removal coefficients of 57.0\% and 76.3\% respectively were achieved in the column, while in the cell an efficiency coefficient of 70.4\% and a coefficient of removal of 83.2\% were measured. It should be noted that in all cases the concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons in the discharges were below criterion C of the Ministry of the Environment and Wildlife of Quebec (3500 ppm) and that the mass of the concentrate represented a maximum of 10\% of the mass of the 'food. Although at first sight the results of the cell tests seem superior, it should be noted that these were carried out in batch mode while the column tests were carried out in continuous mode. So, based on the modeling, it seems that on the contrary the columns are slightly larger than the cells. The use of flotation columns is therefore suggested to remove petroleum hydrocarbons from contaminated port sediments.},

The round goby, native to the same Eurasian regions as the mussels, now thrives in the Great Lakes by eating zebra mussels.

Similar surveys up until a decade ago showed 70 per cent of the angling effort in Lake St. Clair was targeted on walleye, with musky a distant fourth-place at nine per cent.

But they have also been credited with cleaning up bodies like Lake Erie and Hamilton Harbour.                 Zebra mussels consume cancer-causing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) with their microscopic plant diet, and gobies eat about 75 of these mussels a day. Since round gobies usually only grow to about 10 centimetres, they are prey for bigger game fish like bass and pike, and there was concern that PCBs could make their way up the food chain to humans.                 Mike Pettigrew owns Caledonia Bait and Tackle and he's worried because gobies grow faster than food fish, such as perch. If the two species spawn at the same time, gobies will eat the perch minnows.},

	abstract = {The brief reinforces the EPA's conclusions that emissions from midwestern states contribute significantly to excessive levels of ozone and smog problems in northeastern states. Canadian experience and scientific evidence shows that U.S. sources of NOx emissions also "contribute significantly" to NOx and ozone levels in Canada. Reduction of these emissions should result in significant health benefits not only for Americans, but also Canadians living in eastern Canada. As a result, Canada is urging the U.S. Court of Appeals to conclude that the EPA's conclusion and judgment is sound and to uphold the regulation.


The EPA Nitrogen Oxide Emissions Reduction Program (NOx), which goes into effect in 2003, applies to 22 states and the District of Columbia. It will reduce emissions of NOx by 1.1 million tons per year in the affected 22 states and the District of Columbia, and will reduce pollution that is transported across state boundaries and into Canada. Reducing cross-border air pollution will have significant health benefits in Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.


Canada's positions are already well known by the EPA as, over the last year, the Government has filed two separate submissions to the Agency while the NOx reduction program was under development, and another when the U.S. was tightening their air quality standards. Technical analysis done in Canada has shown that even with a domestic program, reductions in the United States of ground-level ozone and its precursor emissions -- NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) -- are required to resolve Canada's ground-level ozone problems.},

	abstract = {A new alien invader has recently been added to the list of species that has infiltrated Lake Ontario. Cercopagis pengoi is a cousin of the spiny water flea, a type of zooplankton. An unwelcome guest, the c.pengoi is a predator that eats domestic species. It also gets caught on fishing lines and makes it difficult for anglers to reel in their lines. Like most other unwanted species, the c.pengoi originated in Europe. It was first reported in the Brighton- Port Hope area in August 1998.


Alien or exotic species are organisms that have been introduced to habitats where they are not native. Freed from predators, parasites, pathogens and competitors that keep their numbers in check, these species are considered biological pollutants. In the presence of food and a favorable environment, they will often overrun their new habitat and crowd out native species.


Human activity is the primary cause of this alien invasion. Some species, such as purple loosestrife and carp, were intentionally introduced with disastrous results. Other species were accidentally carried here on animals, vehicles, ships, commercial goods and produce. The ballast of international ships, pumped into our waterways, has been identified as a major source of these unwanted guests. Once introduced, they are spread throughout the continent's interior on boats and other recreational vehicles.},

	abstract = {The valve movement responses (VMR) of freshwater unionid bivalves to increasing concentrations of total Mn, U, Cd or Cu, under conditions of varying pH and/or dissolved organic carbon (model fulvic acid) concentrations, were experimentally measured using a computer-based data acquisition system. Specifically, Velesunio angasi, from Magela Creek in tropical northern Australia, was exposed to Mn and/or U in synthetic freshwater between pH 5.0 and 6.0, both with and without model FA (3.15 or 7.91 mg L-1). In contrast, Hyridella depressa, from the Hawkesbury-Nepean River in temperate eastern Australia, was exposed to Cd and/or Cu in synthetic freshwater between pH 6.5 and 7.5, both with and without model FA (4.20 or 11.2 mg L-1). Despite differences in bivalve species, geographical location (climate) and water chemistry, valve movement patterns and concentration-response curves were similar for all metals. The results showed that VMR is a quantifiable, sensitive and rapid, realtime endpoint for assessing the toxic effects of metal exposures. For Mn or Cd, VMR was independent (P {\textgreater} 0.05) of pH and/or model FA concentration. In contrast, VMR to U or Cu was highly dependent (P {\textless} 0.05) on pH and/or model FA concentration; individuals were more sensitive to U or Cu at low pH and model FA concentrations. Additionally, results from the concentration-response experiments were used to evaluate the free ion activity model (FIAM). Drug-receptor theory was used to develop an extended form of the FIAM to obtain a more rigorous conceptual model. The developed model explains the conditions under which the FIAM will be effective in explaining biological response (BR), but more importantly, precisely quantifies the interaction of metal species at cell receptor sites. Valve movement responses to Mn or Cd were directly proportional to the activity of the free metal ion (Mn2+ or Cd2+), which is consistent with both the original and extended FIAM. In contrast, VMR to U or Cu were regarded as an 'exception' to the original FIAM, since they were a weighted function of the activities of the free metal ion and the 1 :1 metal hydroxide species (UO22+ + UO2OH+ or Cu2+ + CuOH+). However, this result is consistent with the extended FIAM, with BR primarily dependent on the activity of UOl+ or Cu2+, and secondarily dependent on the activity of OH-. Based on the extended FIAM, this study proposes, for the first time, a quantitative method of uncoupling the biological effects of a metal hydroxide species from that of amelioration of the free metal ion by H+. This is a major outcome, since the activities of metal hydroxide and H+cannot be independently varied. Additionally, concentration-response data obtained from the literature, that are considered to be 'exceptions' to the original FIAM, were reexamined and found to be consistent with the extended FIAM. Overall, the extended FIAM provides a potentially more useful tool for evaluating metal-organism interaction than the original FIAM.},

The book offers specific recommendations for salmon rehabilitation that take into account the key role played by genetic variability in salmon survival and the urgent need for habitat protection and management of fishing.
The committee presents a comprehensive discussion of the salmon problem, with a wealth of informative graphs and charts and the right amount of historical perspective to clarify today's issues, including
Salmon biology and geography--their life's journey from fresh waters to the sea and back again to spawn, and their interaction with ecosystems along the way. The impacts of human activities--grazing, damming, timber, agriculture, and population and economic growth. Included is a case study of Washington state's Elwha River dam removal project. Values, attitudes, and the conflicting desires for short-term economic gain and long-term environmental health. The committee traces the roots of the salmon problem to the extractive philosophy characterizing management of land and water in the West. The impact of hatcheries, which were introduced to build fish stocks but which have actually harmed the genetic variability that wild stocks need to survive.

	abstract = {At present, 244 species are classified as endangered, threatened or vulnerable. Contributing factors include the loss of key habitats, overharvesting, the introduction of exotic species such as the zebra mussel, the contamination of ecosystems by toxic substances and climate change.                 The list of species at risk includes relatively well-known, much- admired creatures such as the whooping crane, the peregrine falcon, the eastern bluebird, several species of whales, the sea otter and the polar bear. It also comprises some not-so-famous living beings that are significant in their own right.                 Governments can't control nature, but they can try to control the human activities that threaten species. The new legislation would regulate the killing, disturbing or injuring of species at risk, and control the buying, selling and international trafficking of them. Officials would be required to prepare plans for the recovery of an endangered species.},

	abstract = {photo DEVELOPMENT is causing irreversible losses of fish and wildlife habitat in B.C. and Washington marine ar eas. Because of this, the B.C./Washington Marine Science Panel has assigned top priority to habitat protection in the recommendations of a report released Tuesday.                 Wetlands near river mouths are critical nursery and feeding areas for numerous species of fish, shellfish and birds. The abundance of some species also may depend on other factors, but near shore habitat, once lost, is likely to be gone forever. The panel recommends a moratorium on the loss of further near shore estuarine habitat in regions that already have lost more than 30 per cent of historic areas, until further research has clarified the impact of habitat loss and the public has decided how much should be preserved in the long term.                 Once toxic sources have been controlled, the ecosystem recovers within a few years. Future regulation of discharges should be based on a determination of the actual or potential harm, with particular attention being paid to "non-point sources," such as runoff from urban and agricultural areas, as well as to "point sources," from industry or sewage treatment plants. The degree of sewage treatment required varies tremendously. In some locations advanced treatment is required because of fecal contamination of shellfish beds, excessive algal growth from nutrient inputs, or toxic chemicals. In most open water areas, however, the contamination and nutrient problems are minimal and only the reduction of toxic chemical sources is needed.},

Fishermen follow the fate of yellow perch more closely because it represents nearly two-thirds of the total landed value from 1966 to 1991. It goes for about \$2.40 a pound compared to white perch which is worth about 40 cents a pound, [Mike Darnell] said.              The environment has changed in the last five years. Zebra mussels have cleaned the lake, to the detriment of perch which like turbid water. The clearer habitat favors pickerel which are now in abundance and easy to catch.

In addition, predation, interbreeding, infection and an ability to alter habitat are additional stresses exotic organisms put on our native fish and wildlife species.                 Project Purple is an extension of a successful 1992 OFAH program. It employs teams of students who control and research purple loosestrife (lythrum salicaria), a foreign plant that devours hundreds of thousands of wetland acres every year, leaving fish and wildlife homeless. This otherwise beautiful, purple-flowering perennial was brought from Europe in the 1800s and is now found throughout North America. With each plant producing 2.7 million seeds annually, the purple invader quickly takes over an area, displacing native vegetation and the fish and wildlife species that depend on that vegetation for food and shelter.                 Since 1990, when the OFAH brought invading species to the public's attention, the federation has mounted a successful campaign that saw laws passed in 50 municipalities declaring purple loosestrife noxious. Many agencies, including the ministry, have become more active on all invading species, said [Morgan].},

	abstract = {Waterfowl in Winter was first published in 1988. Minnesota Archive Editions uses digital technology to make long-unavailable books once again accessible, and are published unaltered from the original University of Minnesota Press editions.

The emphasis in research on waterfowl has traditionally focused on breeding as opposed to migrant or wintering birds. Scientists have long been interested in courtship, nest sites, laying, and brood-rearing, and they have also been concerned about losses of eggs, young, nesting hens, and breeding habitats, especially as they have affected the goal of increasing populations. But lately there has been an upsurge of interest and research on the migratory and wintering phases, and this volume offers ample evidence of the knowledge gained.
