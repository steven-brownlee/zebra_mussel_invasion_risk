	abstract = {An innovative collection of essays that foregrounds specific cargoes as a means to understand connectivity and mobility across the Indian Ocean world. 
Scholars have long appreciated the centrality of trade and commerce in understanding the connectivity and mobility that underpin human experience in the Indian Ocean region. But studies of merchant and commercial activities have paid little attention to the role that cargoes have played in connecting the disparate parts of this vast oceanic world. Drawing from the work of anthropologists, geographers, and historians, Cargoes in Motion tells the story of how material objects have informed and continue to shape processes of exchange across the Indian Ocean.
By following selected cargoes through both space and time, this book makes an important and innovative contribution to Indian Ocean studies. The multidisciplinary approach deepens our understanding of the nature and dynamics of the Indian Ocean world by showing how transoceanic connectivity has been driven not only by economic, social, cultural, and political factors but also by the materiality of the objects themselves.

	abstract = {As long as we have mining and mineral processing, tailings and the responsible management thereof will remain at the forefront, with a company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in part a reflection of how well tailings risks are being managed. The Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) was published in August 2020, aiming to prevent catastrophic failure of tailings facilities by providing operators with specified measures and approaches throughout the mine life cycle, taking into account multiple stakeholder perspectives. In 2021, the International Council on Mining \& Metals (ICMM) published the Tailings Management: Good Practice Guide intended to support safe, responsible management of tailings across the global mining industry, providing guidance on good governance and engineering practices to support continual improvement in tailings storage facility (TSF) management and help foster and strengthen the safety culture of mining companies. The Tailings Management Handbook is important and timely because there is no other comprehensive resource rooted in these new fundamentals and global principles for tailings management. Tailings management requires interdisciplinary and cross-functional understanding and support, which is apparent throughout this handbook. Dive into the wealth of information contributed by more than 100 world-renowned experts, beautifully crafted into a full-color handbook that focuses on the basics, life-cycle planning, site and tailings characterization, TSF design and construction, as well as systems and operations of TSFs. The inclusion of 42 case studies is an added plus with real-world successes and lessons learned.},

One of the main sources of natural pigments are plants and insects; however, microorganisms are of great interest due to their bioactivities and advantages in their production. Actinobacteria, especially the genus Streptomyces, are biotechnologically valuable, producing specialized metabolites with a broad spectrum of bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anticancer, antibiofilm, antifouling, and antibiotic activities, as well as pigments, among others. In this review, we identify, summarize, and evaluate the evidence regarding the potential of Streptomyces strains to be biological sources of bioactive pigments. To conclude, future research will include purifying pigmented extracts that have already been reported, studying the purified compounds in a specific application, isolating new microorganisms from new isolation sources, improving the production of pigments already identified, modifying culture media or using new technologies, and developing new extraction techniques and a wide range of solvents that are ecofriendly and efficient.},

	abstract = {Dual membrane hybrid systems generally produce reclaimed water for non-potable uses by blending microfiltered biologically treated sewage effluent (BTSE) and reverse osmosis (RO) permeate. This reclaimed water is found to contain a significant amount of micro-pollutants, which possibly cause toxicity effects to aquatic organisms and plants when exposed to it. Therefore, removing such pollutants from the reclaimed water before reaching the community is highly emphasized nowadays. The currently used treatment of the RO treatment of microfiltered BTSE is energy intensive and not cost effective. This paper focuses on less costly and efficient membrane-based hybrid treatment systems such as the microfiltration-adsorption (MF-GAC) hybrid system, Nano filter (NF) and RO in the removal of micro-pollutants from the microfiltered BTSE. Both the MF-GAC hybrid system and NF (with NTR 729HF membrane) removed 70 to 95\% of micropollutants from microfiltered BTSE. The removal depends on the hydrophobicity, charge, and size of the micropollutants. RO was excellent in removing more than 90\% of pollutants, while MF was inefficient, as the latter primarily depends on the size exclusion mechanism. Based on the finding, it is suggested to treat only a portion of microfiltered BTSE through the MF-GAC or NF membrane before blending with RO permeate to enhance the removal of micro-pollutants from reclaimed water. The development of sustainable hybrid systems for the removal of all micropollutants of different chemical and physical properties is the key for the water reclamation.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryNowadays, micro- and nanoplastic particles can be found almost everywhere, being especially harmful for humans. Their absorption, primarily via inhalation and digestive routes, might lead to a particularly dangerous accumulation of those substances within the human body. Due to the alarming increase in contamination worldwide and excessive production of plastics and synthetic materials, there is an urgent need to investigate the effects of those substances on human health. So far, it has been observed that nano- and microplastics might be extremely harmful, leading to serious health conditions, such as cancers of various human body systems.AbstractMicro- and nanoplatics have been already reported to be potential carcinogenic/mutagenic substances that might cause DNA damage, leading to carcinogenesis. Thus, the effects of micro- and nanoplastics exposure on human health are currently being investigated extensively to establish clear relationships between those substances and health consequences. So far, it has been observed that there exists a definite correlation between exposure to micro- and nanoplastic particles and the onset of several cancers. Therefore, we have conducted research using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, searching for all the research papers devoted to cancers that could be potentially related to the subject of exposure to nano- and microplastics. Ultimately, in this paper, we have discussed several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, biliary tract cancer, and some endocrine-related cancers.},

	abstract = {Microcystins (MCs) are cyclic heptapeptidic toxins produced by many cyanobacteria. Microcystins can be accumulated in various matrices in two forms: a free cellular fraction and a covalently protein-bound form. To detect and quantify the concentration of microcystins, a panel of techniques on various matrices (water, sediments, and animal tissues) is available. The analysis of MCs can concern the free or the total (free plus covalently bound) fractions. Free-form analyses of MCs are the most common and easiest to detect, whereas total-form analyses are much less frequent and more complex to achieve. The objective of this review is to summarize the different methods of extraction and analysis that have been developed for total forms. Four extraction methods were identified: MMPB (2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid) method, deconjugation at basic pH, ozonolysis, and laser irradiation desorption. The study of the bibliography on the methods of extraction and analysis of the total forms of MCs showed that the reference method for the subject remains the MMPB method even if alternative methods and, in particular, deconjugation at basic pH, showed results encouraging the continuation of the methodological development on different matrices and on naturally-contaminated samples.},

	abstract = {Transcriptional coactivator p15 (PC4) encodes a structurally conserved but functionally diverse protein that plays crucial roles in RNAP-II-mediated transcription, DNA replication and damage repair. Although structures and functions of PC4 have been reported in most vertebrates and some invertebrates, the PC4 genes were less systematically identified and characterized in the bay scallop Argopecten irradians irradians. In this study, five PC4 genes (AiPC4s) were successfully identified in bay scallops via whole-genome scanning through in silico analysis. Protein structure and phylogenetic analyses of AiPC4s were conducted to determine the identities and evolutionary relationships of these genes. Expression levels of AiPC4s were assessed in embryos/larvae at all developmental stages, in healthy adult tissues and in different tissues (mantles, gills, hemocytes and hearts) being processed under 32 °C stress with different time durations (0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 3 d, 6 d and 10 d). Spatiotemporal expression profiles of AiPC4s suggested the functional roles of the genes in embryos/larvae at all developmental stages and in healthy adult tissues in bay scallop. Expression regulations (up- and down-) of AiPC4s under high-temperature stress displayed both tissue-specific and time-dependent patterns with function allocations, revealing that AiPC4s performed differentiated functions in response to thermal stress. This work provides clues of molecular function allocation of PC4 in scallops in response to thermal stress and helps in illustrating how marine bivalves resist elevated seawater temperature.},

Adverse effects were evaluated at the organism and population levels through the classical ecotoxicological tests. Acute tests on D. magna and D. rerio revealed a 50\% effect concentration (EC50) {\textgreater} 100.0 mg/L for both ELT-dg and ELT-dp. Chronic exposures had a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 100.0 mg/L for both ELT-dg and ELT-dp on P. subcapitata grow rate and yield. LOEC decreased in the other model organisms, with a value of 9.8 mg/L for D. magna, referring to the number of living offspring, exposed to ELT-dg suspension. Similarly, in D. rerio, the main results highlighted a LOEC of 10.0 mg/L regarding the survival and juvenile weight parameters for ELT-dg and a LOEC of 10.0 mg/L concerning the survival and abnormal behavior in specimens exposed to ELT-dp. Tested materials exhibited a threshold of toxicity of 9.8 mg/L, probably a non-environmental concentration, although further investigations are needed to clarify the potential ecological impact of these emerging contaminants.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.12386},
	abstract = {Despite the increasing data concerning the structure of the adult nervous system in various Lophotrochozoa groups, the early events during the neurogenesis of rare and unique groups need clarification. Annelida are a diverse clade of Lophotrochozoa, and their representatives demonstrate a variety of body plans, lifestyles, and life cycles. Comparative data about the early development are available for Errantia, Sedentaria, Sipuncula, and Palaeoannelida; however, our knowledge of Dinophiliformia is currently scarce. Representatives of Dinophiliformia are small interstitial worms combining unique morphological features of different Lophotrochozoan taxa and expressing paedomorphic traits. We describe in detail the early neurogenesis of two related species: Dimorphilus gyrociliatus and Dinophilus vorticoides, from the appearance of first nerve cells until the formation of an adult body plan. In both species, the first cells were detected at the anterior and posterior regions at the early trochophore stage and demonstrated positive reactions with pan-neuronal marker anti-acetylated tubulin only. Long fibers of early cells grow towards each other and form longitudinal bundles along which differentiating neurons later appear and send their processes. We propose that these early cells serve as pioneer neurons, forming a layout of the adult nervous system. The early anterior cell of D. vorticoides is transient and present during the short embryonic period, while early anterior and posterior cells in D. gyrociliatus are maintained throughout the whole lifespan of the species. During development, the growing processes of early cells form compact brain neuropile, paired ventral and lateral longitudinal bundles; unpaired medial longitudinal bundle; and commissures in the ventral hyposphere. Specific 5-HT- and FMRFa-immunopositive neurons differentiate adjacent to the ventral bundles and brain neuropile in the middle trochophore and late trochophore stages, i.e. after the main structures of the nervous system have already been established. Processes of 5-HT- and FMRFa-positive cells constitute a small proportion of the tubulin-immunopositive brain neuropile, ventral cords, and commissures in all developmental stages. No 5-HT- and FMRFa-positive cells similar to apical sensory cells of other Lophotrochozoa were detected. We conclude that: (i) like in Errantia and Sedentaria, Dinophiliformia neurogenesis starts from the peripheral cells, whose processes prefigure the forming adult nervous system, (ii) Dinophiliformia early cells are negative to 5-HT and FMRFa antibodies like Sedentaria pioneer cells.},

Availability of pure water is decreasing day by day, and water scarcity has become a major problem that our society has faced for the past few years. Hence, it is essential to find and disseminate the key solutions for water quality and scarcity issues. Inaccessibility and poor water quality continue to pose a major threat to human health worldwide. Around billions of people lack to access drinkable water, and, often, water contains pathogenic impurities which are responsible for water-borne diseases. The concept of water quality mainly depends on the chemical, physical, biological, and radiological measurement standards to evaluate the water quality and determine the concentration of all components, then compare the results of this concentration with the purpose for which this water is used. Therefore, awareness and a firm grounding in water science are the primary needs of readers, professionals, and researchers working in this research area.
This book explores the basic concepts and applications of water science. It provides an in-depth look at water pollutants' classification, water recycling, qualitative and quantitative analysis, and efficient wastewater treatment methodologies. It also provides occurrence, human health risk assessment, strategies for removal of radionuclides and pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems. The book chapters are written by leading researchers throughout the world. This book is an invaluable guide to students, professors, scientists and R\&D industrial specialists working in the field of environmental science, geoscience, water science, physics and chemistry.
This outstanding new volume:

Provides a detailed overview of applications and challenges in water science
Examines how to reach the best standard for measuring water quality
Highlights future research directions to address the lack of comprehensive data on water science

"Recommended for school and public libraries regardless of their proximity to the west coast. Although works of fiction, the books contain a wealth of accessible facts."--Resource Links "A major theme that emerges is the need to respect and care for the ocean environment and to understand the harmony among its inhabitants. These appealing, fact-rich books go a long way to enhancing that understanding for young readers. Highly recommended."--CM: Canadian Review of Materials Sam and Crystal's coastal adventure continues as brother and sister dive deeper--literally--into the marine habitats of Eagle Cove, home of Aunt Kate and Uncle Charlie. In their third adventure, the kids learn about one of the most ecologically important ecosystems on the west coast: the eelgrass meadow. This rich habitat provides food and shelter to countless marine critters--from tiny micro-organisms to hundreds of fish species to giant marine mammals, such as humpback whales. Ada, an Indigenous woman from nearby Salmon Bay Village, tells the children about her people's knowledge of land and sea, complementing Aunt Kate's Western scientific teachings and reinforcing the importance of respecting nature. Combining an entertaining story with gorgeous imagery and the author's scientific background and extensive work with Indigenous Elders and educators, Explore the Emerald Eelgrass Meadow with Sam and Crystal brings the coastline to life for children ages eight and up.},

Machlis show how the national parks are essential to maintaining the essence of our national heritage, and key to America's future in a changing climate and political landscape. Sharing real-world examples of both victories and defeats in protecting national parks, this candid, thoughtful book reminds us that the national parks are a promise--a covenant--within and between generations of Americans. The book is also a call to revitalize, reconstitute, reconfigure, and reform the National Park Service, which the authors believe is governed too much by outdated management practices and politics instead of a foundation of expertise and science.},

The average accumulation of metals was in the following order: Tilapia zillii {\textgreater} Oreochromis aureus {\textgreater} Oreochromis niloticus. To determine the risk of fish consumption, the estimated daily intake, carcinogenic, non-carcinogenic and relative risk indices were calculated. The results indicate that the intake of individual metals through the consumption of fish is almost safe for human health, whereas the intake of combined metals poses a high potential health risk to consumers. Assessment of carcinogenic risk of Cd and Ni from the consumption of tilapia species indicates that consumers are at risk of cancer. The contribution of Pb and Cd to the overall relative risk index ranged from 34\% to 41\%. Of the three species studied, Oreochromis niloticus is relatively safe for consumption as it poses the least health hazard, while Tilapia zillii is more predisposed to accumulate metals in its tissues. Histopathological changes were observed in the muscles, gills and liver of Oreochromis niloticus as a result of heavy metal accumulation in these organs.},

	abstract = {An intensification of toxic cyanobacteria blooms has occurred over the last three decades, severely affecting coastal and lake water quality in many parts of the world. Extensive research is being conducted in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the driving forces that alter the ecological balance in water bodies and of the biological role of the secondary metabolites, toxins included, produced by the cyanobacteria. In the long-term, such knowledge may help to develop the needed procedures to restore the phytoplankton community to the pre-toxic blooms era. In the short-term, the mission of the scientific community is to develop novel approaches to mitigate the blooms and thereby restore the ability of affected communities to enjoy coastal and lake waters. Here, we critically review some of the recently proposed, currently leading, and potentially emerging mitigation approaches in-lake novel methodologies and applications relevant to drinking-water treatment.},

	abstract = {In the developing vertebrate retina, retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) proliferate and give rise to terminally differentiated neurons with exquisite spatio-temporal precision. Lineage commitment, fate determination and terminal differentiation are controlled by intricate crosstalk between the genome and epigenome. Indeed, epigenetic regulation plays pivotal roles in numerous cell fate specification and differentiation events in the retina. Moreover, aberrant chromatin structure can contribute to developmental disorders and retinal pathologies. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of epigenetic regulation in the retina. We also provide insight into several aspects of epigenetic-related regulation that should be investigated in future studies of retinal development and disease. Importantly, focusing on these mechanisms could contribute to the development of novel treatment strategies targeting a variety of retinal disorders.},

Many studies have been conducted on its toxicological effects on living organisms from morphological to physiological aspects. However, there are few studies about the transgenerational toxicological of Cr(VI). In this study, we exposed adult marine medaka fishes with Cr(VI) and their offspring with Cr(VI) to examine transgenerational effects of Cr(VI). We found that there were mechanisms such as changing reproduction modes in males to compensate for impacts on the reproduction. There were differences and similarities between the parental effect and the environmental effect, with the former one causing more serious adverse effects on the offspring of Cr(VI)-exposed fish. It was noteworthy that there was an interaction between the parental and offspring treatment which leads to the attenuation of the parental effects on offspring when the offspring also underwent the same treatment. In addition, physiological adaptation has also been observed in fish to improve their fitness. Overall, effects of Cr(VI) on fish and their offspring were studied to pave a way to study the of mechanisms of adaptation.},

The fish were caught using a gill net and were assigned to three different weight groups (W1, W2, and W3) to study the degree of variation in DNA fragmentation in relation to body weight. In fish from the polluted site, DNA fragmentation was higher in kidney, liver, gills, and muscles, compared to the control. No significant DNA fragmentation was observed in fish collected from the control site. Highly significant (P {\textless} 0.01) relationship between body weight and DNA fragmentation was found in the organs of fish procured at the contaminated site. DNA fragmentation in body organs was found to be affected by the concentrations of lead, copper, nickel, and cadmium in W. attu, S. sarwari, L. rohita, and V. vulgarus harvested from Chenab River. DNA fragmentation in different freshwater fish species is therefore a reliable biomarker of water pollution.Alternate abstract:Este estudo foi conduzido para avaliar a poluição da água examinando a fragmentação do DNA em órgãos de peixes selecionados (rim, fígado, brânquias e tecido muscular) de Wallago attu, Sperata sarwari, Vulgaris vulgaris e Labeo rohita coletados de uma conhecida área poluída do rio Chenab, Paquistão e de um local de controle. Os peixes foram capturados usando uma rede branquial e foram divididos em três grupos de pesos differentes (W1, W2 e W3) para estudar o grau de variação na fragmentação do DNA em relação ao peso corporal. Nos peixes do local poluído, a fragmentação do DNA foi maior nos rins, fígado, brânquias e músculos, em comparação ao controle. Não foi observada fragmentação signifcativa do DNA em peixes coletados no local de controle. Relação altamente signifcativa (P {\textless}0,01) entre o peso corporal e a fragmentação do DNA foi encontrada nos órgãos dos peixes adquiridos no local contaminado. Verifcou-se que a fragmentação do DNA nos órgãos do corpo é afetada pelas concentrações de chumbo, cobre, níquel e cádmio em W. attu, S. sarwari, L. rohita e V. vulgarus colhidos no rio Chenab.

	abstract = {The exchange between the water column and the seafloor is a complex process, and is particularly intensive in the shallow waters of highly productive coastal areas, where the temporal variability in the inputs of pelagic organic matter will determine many aspects of the benthic community structure. However, few studies have focused on the seasonality of inputs of organic matter to the seafloor, and on the consequent dynamics and time scales of response of benthic consumers. We conducted a one-year study where we repeatedly sampled multiple organic compounds traditionally used as markers to study the link between the pelagic organic matter inputs and the seafloor, and the potential response of benthic macrofauna to seasonal trends in phytoplankton biomass. We simultaneously quantified the particulate organic matter in the water column, the sinking material and different seafloor compartments, and analysed it for pigments, organic carbon and nitrogen content, C/N ratio, and stable isotopes. Seafloor sediment was also analysed for total lipids, and the dominant macrobenthic species for isotopic signatures. Results showed a major deposition of fresh organic matter during the spring bloom followed by more degraded organic matter inputs during the late summer bloom and even lower quality of the organic matter reaching the seafloor during winter. Strong positive relationships between water column and sedimentary pigments suggest that phytoplankton was the main source of carbon to the seafloor. The isotopic signatures of the dominant macrobenthic species suggest a fast response to the organic matter inputs from the water column. However, different species responded differently to the deposition of organic matter. Macoma balthica and Marenzelleria spp. fed on more reworked and degraded sedimentary material, while Monoporeia affinis showed a shift in the feeding habits according to its life stage, with adult individuals feeding on fresher material than juveniles did. Our study highlights the seasonal variability of the benthic-pelagic coupling and the utility of a multi-marker approach to follow the temporal inputs of organic matter from the water column to the seafloor and benthic organisms.},

	abstract = {This ground-breaking handbook uniquely addresses challenges of nanotechnology with respect to safety, risk and ethical, society and legal implications (ELSI) along with the commercialization aspects. 
This Handbook focuses on the recent advancements in Safety, Risk, Ethical Society and Legal Implications (ESLI) as well as its commercialization of nanotechnology, such as manufacturing. Nano is moving out of its relaxation phase of scientific route, and as new products go to market, organizations all over the world, as well as the general public, are discussing the environmental and health issues associated with nanotechnology. Nongovernmental science organizations have long since reacted; however, now the social sciences have begun to study the cultural portent of nanotechnology.
Societal concerns and their newly constructed concepts, show nanoscience interconnected with the economy, ecology, health, and governance. This handbook addresses these new challenges and is divided into 7 sections:

Nanomaterials and the Environment;
Life Cycle Environmental Implications of Nanomanufacturing;
Bioavailability and Toxicity of Manufactured Nanoparticles in Terrestrial Environments;
Occupational Health Hazards of Nanoparticles;
Ethical Issues in Nanotechnology;
Commercialization of Nanotechnology;
Legalization of Nanotechnology.

Audience
This handbook will be of significant interest to scientists and researchers working on nanoscience and nanotechnology, materials scientists, chemists, pharmacists, biologists and chemical engineers. In addition, it will provide essential information to consultants and regulators about nanotechnology applications and processes helpful in their evaluation and decision-making procedures. University graduate and post-graduate students taking advance level of nanoscience and technology courses will find this handbook easy to use and understandable.

	abstract = {An authoritative survey of different contexts, methodologies, and theories of applied communication 
The field of Applied Communication Research (ACR) has made substantial progress over the past five decades in studying communication problems, and in making contributions to help solve them. Changes in society, human relationships, climate and the environment, and digital media have presented myriad contexts in which to apply communication theory.
The Handbook of Applied Communication Research addresses a wide array of contemporary communication issues, their research implications in various contexts, and the challenges and opportunities for using communication to manage problems. This innovative work brings together the diverse perspectives of a team of notable international scholars from across disciplines.

The Handbook of Applied Communication Research includes discussion and analysis spread across two comprehensive volumes. Volume one introduces ACR, explores what is possible in the field, and examines theoretical perspectives, organizational communication, risk and crisis communication, and media, data, design, and technology. The second volume focuses on real-world communication topics such as health and education communication, legal, ethical, and policy issues, and volunteerism, social justice, and communication activism. Each chapter addresses a specific issue or concern, and discusses the choices faced by participants in the communication process. This important contribution to communication research:

Explores how various communication contexts are best approached
Addresses balancing scientific findings with social and cultural issues
Discusses how and to what extent media can mitigate the effects of adverse events
Features original findings from ongoing research programs and original communication models and frameworks
Presents the best available research and insights on where current research and best practices should move in the future
A major addition to the body of knowledge in the field,
The Handbook of Applied Communication Research is an invaluable work for advanced undergraduate students, graduate students, and scholars.

	abstract = {Sequence count data are commonly modelled using the negative binomial (NB) distribution. Several empirical studies, however, have demonstrated that methods based on the NB-assumption do not always succeed in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at its nominal level. In this paper, we propose a dedicated statistical goodness of fit test for the NB distribution in regression models and demonstrate that the NB-assumption is violated in many publicly available RNA-Seq and 16S rRNA microbiome datasets. The zero-inflated NB distribution was not found to give a substantially better fit. We also show that the NB-based tests perform worse on the features for which the NB-assumption was violated than on the features for which no significant deviation was detected. This gives an explanation for the poor behaviour of NB-based tests in many published evaluation studies. We conclude that nonparametric tests should be preferred over parametric methods.},

Species-specific chapters provide practical information on medical management, including the most prevalent concerns for each species and the epidemiology of infectious diseases.

Provides a complete reference to handling, diagnosing, and treating wild species
Covers the full range of North American wildlife
Includes concepts that can be applied to species globally
Emphasizes information relevant to the wildlife setting
Focuses on individual medicine, firmly grounded within population medicine for a broader approach
Targeted at wildlife veterinarians, veterinary clinicians that will be presented with wildlife, veterinary technicians, and wildlife rehabilitators

Medical Management of Wildlife Species is a must-have addition to the bookshelf of wildlife veterinarians and any veterinarian seeing occasional wild animals, as well as wildlife biologists and researchers.

Here we present the first finding of a TRIM element in bivalves, and among the first known in the kingdom Animalia. Class Bivalvia has high ecological and commercial importance in marine ecosystems and aquaculture, and, in recent years, an increasing number of genomic studies has addressed to these organisms. We have identified biv-TRIM in several bivalve species: Donax trunculus, Ruditapes decussatus, R. philippinarum, Venerupis corrugata, Polititapes rhomboides, Venus verrucosa, Dosinia exoleta, Glycymeris glycymeris, Cerastoderma edule, Magallana gigas, Mytilus galloprovincialis. biv-TRIM has several characteristics typical for this group of elements, exhibiting different variations. In addition to canonically structured elements, solo-TDRs and tandem repeats were detected. The presence of this element in the genome of each species is {\textless}1\%. The phylogenetic analysis showed a complex clustering pattern of biv-TRIM elements, and indicates the involvement of horizontal transfer in the spreading of this element.},

Respiratory Biology of Animals provides a contemporary and truly integrative approach to the topic, adopting a strong evolutionary theme. It covers aerobic metabolism at all levels, from gas exchange organs such as skin,gills, and lungs to mitochondria - the site of cellular respiration. The book also describes the functional morphology and physiology of the circulatory system, which often contains gas-carrying pigments and is important for pH regulation in the organism. A final section describes the evolution ofanimal respiratory systems. Throughout the book, examples are selected from the entire breadth of the animal kingdom, identifying common themes that transcend taxonomy.Respiratory Biology of Animals is an accessible supplementary text suitable for both senior undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in respiratory biology, comparative animal physiology, and environmental physiology. It is also of relevance and use to the many professional academics requiring a concise but authoritative overview of the topic.},

	abstract = {An authoritative overview of the ecological activities of microbes in the biosphere Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Ecology presents a broad overview of microbial activity and microbes' interactions with their environments and communities. Adopting an integrative approach, this text covers both conventional ecological issues as well as cross-disciplinary investigations that combine facets of microbiology, ecology, environmental science and engineering, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Focusing primarily on single-cell forms of prokaryotes -- and cellular forms of algae, fungi, and protozoans -- this book enables readers to gain insight into the fundamental methodologies for the characterization of microorganisms in the biosphere. The authors draw from decades of experience to examine the environmental processes mediated by microorganisms and explore the interactions between microorganisms and higher life forms. Highly relevant to modern readers, this book examines topics including the ecology of microorganisms in engineered environments, microbial phylogeny and interactions, microbial processes in relation to environmental pollution, and many more. Now in its second edition, this book features updated references and major revisions to chapters on assessing microbial communities, community relationships, and their global impact. New content such as effective public communication of research findings and advice on scientific article review equips readers with practical real-world skills. Explores the activities of microorganisms in specific environments with case studies and actual research data Highlights how prominent microbial biologists address significant microbial ecology issues Offers guidance on scientific communication, including scientific presentations and grant preparation Includes plentiful illustrations and examples of microbial interactions, community structures, and human-bacterial connections Provides chapter summaries, review questions, selected reading lists, a complete glossary, and critical thinking exercises Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Ecology is an ideal textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses in biology, microbiology, ecology, and environmental science, while also serving as a current and informative reference for microbiologists, cell and molecular biologists, ecologists, and environmental professionals.},

	abstract = {Microbiota, the microorganisms that colonize living organisms. Oysters rely exclusively on an innate immune system. This study characterized the cultivable gastrointestinal tract microbiota (GTM) of the oyster Crassostrea gasar and evaluated their influence on immune responses. Antibiotics were used to reduce or alter the microbiota during in vitro and in vivo assays. Haemocyte viability, concentration, and phagocytic capacity, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), were evaluated in antibiotic-treated and control oysters. Microbiological analysis of the gastrointestinal tract was also performed; bacteria were selected using culture media and were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA. The results showed that the antibiotics eliminated bacteria in vitro but increased their concentrations in vivo. The GTM was composed of 26\% amylolytic bacteria, 21\% lipolytic bacteria, 18\% proteolytic bacteria, 18\% cellulolytic bacteria and 17\% lactic acid bacteria; there were no differences in the amounts of these bacterial types between the control and treated oysters. Three major bacterial phyla, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and seven genera, Labrenzia, Pseudomonas, Halomonas, Shewanella, Vibrio, Bacillus, and Micrococcus, were detected. The concentration, viability, and phagocytic capacity of hemocytes and the production of ROS were not significantly altered by antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, the antibiotics altered the number of heterotrophic bacteria without changing hemocyte function, suggesting that this assay could be useful for verifying the influence of microbiota in host-parasite interactions.},

Various biogeochemical processes and anthropogenic factors were playing an important role in altering the concentration of heavy metals in the sediments. This paper has two objectives: The first one is to investigate the effect of the variation in the physicochemical conditions on the speciation of trace elements trapped in the sediments of the Sebou River. The second one is to study the kinetics mobilization of these heavy metals. Batch resuspension experiments were conducted in order to investigate the release of heavy metals from a polluted anoxic sediment submitted to different physicochemical conditions variations. It has been revealed that in oxygenated environment, sediments were oxidized which cause the release of some heavy metals, but their concentrations, as dissolved phase, were sustained constant or were increased with time. However, in acidic and anaerobic environment, most of the metallic trace elements were released together with the iron and the manganese, but some of these elements like chromium were precipitated. However, some of other elements were maintained in solution, which represents a real human health risk.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13002-018-0281-0},
	abstract = {Background 
The ethnic groups in Gilgit-Baltistan have been utilizing local resources in their centuries-old traditional healing system. Most tribes within these ethnic groups still rely on traditional healing systems. We aim to understand the current status, uses, and abundance of medicinal plants, associated traditional knowledge, and trade.
Materials and methods
The study incorporated over 300 local community members (70\% men and 30\% women) in focused group discussions, semi-structured interviews, and homework assignments for 8th to 12th grade students to document traditional knowledge (TK) in six districts in Northeast Pakistan. We calculated various indices such as informant consensus factor, use value, relative frequency of citation, and CoKriging. These indices, along with repetitively used medicinal plants, were used to analyze differences in studied locations.
Results
Most of the community members still rely on traditional medication in the study areas. However, we found the highest number of medicinal plants used in Skardu and Gilgit compared to other districts and these two districts also represent trade centers and a highly populated area regarding medicinal plants. Results indicate connection amongst the surveyed villages signifying mixing of knowledge from different sources, with certain areas more influenced by traditional Chinese medicine and others more by Ayurveda and Unani.
Conclusion
TK is mostly retained with elder community members; however, those directly linked with market value chain retain rich knowledge on traditional use of the medicinal plants from the region. Major trade centers in the region also coincide with a high density of medicinal plant occurrence, knowledge, and higher utilization. Therefore, with the increasing trade in medicinal plant in the region, there is potential for rejuvenation of this knowledge and of plant use in the region.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0208836},
	abstract = {A new method is presented for describing the rate of oxygen consumption in response to progressive hypoxia. The method consists of screening candidate functions describing the relationship between Vo2 (oxygen consumption rate) and Po2 (ambient oxygen concentration) by testing each for fit to observed data for a single curve and the function that best fits is chosen using lowest AICc value as the criterion. Descriptive statistics are then extracted from the selected function that best describes the pattern present in the curve. Several new descriptive statistics for the pattern of response are proposed which are based on the null model of simple diffusion and no regulation. The method quantifies deviation from the null model at each point on the curve and measures both positive and negative deviation which occur when the curve changes more slowly or more rapidly than the null model predicts, respectively. The new descriptive statistics generalize the traditional one used in the past, the critical oxygen tension (Pc), and allow interpretation of a variety of shapes of curves which cannot be analyzed with conventional methods. Because the method is descriptive, it does not implicate any specific mechanisms in generating the response. The method is applied to data from 68 animals in 14 different species groups reported in the literature. The overall results suggest the existence of substantial diversity in response types among animals, which requires a more complex description than has traditionally been used.},

It crafts a unique intersection between two fast-developing disciplines: biomimicry and biodesign in architecture, and bioinformatics and natural computing in the natural sciences.This is the first book to examine both the theory and methodology of architecture and design working directly with the natural world. It explores a range of approaches from the use of life-like systems in building design to the employment of actual growing and living cell and tissue cultures as architectural materials - creating architecture that can change, learn and grow with us. The use of 'living architecture' is cutting-edge and speculative, yet it is also inspiring a growing number of designers worldwide to adopt alternative perspectives on sustainability and environmental design. The book examines the ethical and theoretical issues arising alongside case-studies of experimental practice, to explore what we mean by 'natural' in the Anthropocene, and raise deep questions about the nature of design and the design of nature. This provocative and at times controversial book shows why it will become ever more necessary to embrace living processes in architecture if we are to thrive in a sustainable future.},

Although cells are equipped with sophisticated strategies to maintain the redox biology under normal conditions, the abundance of redox-sensitive xenobiotics, such as medicinal ingredients originated from herbs or animals, can dramatically invoke oxidative stress. Growing evidence has documented that the hepatotoxicity can be triggered by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) during treating various diseases. Meanwhile, TCM-dependent hepatic disorder represents a strong correlation with oxidative stress, especially the persistent accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Of note, since TCM-derived compounds with their modulated targets are greatly diversified among themselves, it is complicated to elaborate the potential pathological mechanism. In this regard, data mining approaches, including network pharmacology and bioinformatics enrichment analysis have been utilized to scientifically disclose the underlying pathogenesis. Herein, top 10 principal TCM-modulated targets for oxidative hepatotoxicity including superoxide dismutases (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Bax, caspase-3, Bcl-2, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), and nitric oxide (NO) have been identified. Furthermore, hepatic metabolic dysregulation may be the predominant pathological mechanism involved in TCM-induced hepatotoxic impairment.},

It presents current knowledge about the way animals behave and will enable the reader to derive more pleasure from their observations of animals by gaining a deeper understanding of their behaviour. The concepts are presented in an easily appreciated way with which everyone can associate.In the first part of the book, the author explores how animals behave by considering the physical processes involved in the way animals perceive their environment and what determines how they respond to it. This is followed by the 'why' of animal behaviour in which the author examines many topics under the overall issue of expressing behaviour, and the evolutionary forces that have shaped - and continue to shape - the detailed form of more complex behaviours. Therefore questions such as why animals forage in the way they do and how that foraging pattern may be refined to optimal efficiency; why animals adopt a particular reproductive strategy and breeding behaviour and why some animals live as solitary individuals, while others live in groups and so on. The book is copiously illustrated throughout in support and interpretation of the text. While the pictures enhance understanding of the written text, the text also showcases the exquisite illustrations of wildlife artist Catherine Putman.},

	doi = {10.1103/PhysRevX.8.031071},
	abstract = {Multiplex networks have been intensively studied during the last few years as they offer a more realistic representation of many interdependent and multilevel complex networked systems. However, even if most real networks have some degree of directionality, the vast majority of the existent literature deals with multiplex networks where all layers are undirected. Here, we study the dynamics of diffusion processes acting on coupled multilayer networks where at least one layer consists of a directed graph; we call these directed multiplex networks. We reveal a new and unexpected signature of diffusion dynamics on directed multiplex networks, namely, that different from their undirected counterparts, they can exhibit a nonmonotonic rate of convergence to steady state as a function of the degree of coupling, resulting in a faster diffusion at an intermediate degree of coupling than when the two layers are fully coupled. We use synthetic multiplex examples and real-world topologies to illustrate the characteristics of the underlying dynamics that give rise to a regime in which an optimal coupling exists. We further provide analytical and numerical evidence that this new phenomenon is solely a property of directed multiplex, where at least one of the layers exhibits sufficient directionality quantified by a normalized metric of asymmetry in directional path lengths. Given the ubiquity of both directed and multilayer networks in nature, our results have important implications for studying the dynamics of multilevel complex systems.Alternate abstract:Plain Language Summary
Complex dynamical systems that originate in geophysical, biological, climatic, and social environments often exhibit a networked structure arising from interactions between constituent subsystems. In turn, the analysis of such structures reveals mechanisms behind the properties of the underlying natural processes. Of particular interest is a special class of multilayer networks known as multiplex, where layers consist of an identical set of corresponding nodes, through which they interact, while individually having different topological structure. Here, we initiate the study of multiplex networks with directed layers that are typical of many natural and engineered systems, including geophysical transport on river networks, food webs, gene regulation, and social dynamics.
We show that in contrast to undirected multiplex networks, where the fastest diffusion corresponds to maximal layer coupling, directed multiplex networks explain the emergence of the fastest diffusion at intermediate coupling. We attribute this new phenomenon to the anisotropy inherited by the directionality of the layers, which speeds up mixing via propagation in different directions over separate layers.
Our results have implications in transport dynamics of many social, biological, and natural networks that, more often than not, exhibit process directionality. In particular, our results raise new questions as to whether natural complex systems self-organize into configurations that enhance diffusivity, and they also suggest ways to design artificial networks to operate at an optimal degree of coupling for fastest transport.},

These data will allow easy parasite recognition with a summation of virtually everything now known about the biology of each parasite species covered. The last (very modest) and only treatise published on this subject was in 1981 so this book fills a fundamental gap in our knowledge of what is now known, and what is not, about the coccidian parasites that infect and sometimes kill carnivores and/or their prey that can harbor intermediate stages, including many domestic and game animals. Offers line drawings and photomicrographs of many parasite species that will allow easy diagnosis and identification by both laypersons and professionals (veterinarians, wildlife biologists, etc.) Presents a complete historical rendition of all known publications on carnivore coccidia for all carnivore families and evaluates the scientific and scholarly merit of each apicomplexan species relative to the current body of knowledge Provides a complete species analysis and their known biology of all coccidia described from each carnivore lineage and species Reviews the most current taxonomy of carnivores and their phylogenetic relationships to help assess host-specificity patterns that may be apparent Evaluates what little cross-transmission work is available to help understand the complexities of those coccidians that use two hosts (e.g., Sarcocystis, Besnoitia, and others) Provides known treatments for the various parasite genera/species},

	abstract = {Swamps and marshes once covered vast stretches of the North American landscape. The destruction of these habitats, long seen as wastelands that harbored deadly disease, accelerated in the twentieth century. Today, the majority of the original wetlands in the US have vanished, transformed into farm fields or buried under city streets.In The Marsh Builders, Sharon Levy delves into the intertwined histories of wetlands loss and water pollution. The book's springboard is the tale of a years-long citizen uprising in Humboldt County, California, which led to the creation of one of the first U.S. wetlands designed to treat city sewage. The book explores the global roots of this local story: the cholera epidemics that plagued nineteenth-century Europe; the researchers who invented modern sewage treatment after bumbling across the insight that microbes break down pollutants in water; the discovery that wetlands act as efficient filters for the pollutants unleashed by modern humanity.More than forty years after the passage of the Clean Water Act launched a nation-wide effort to rescue lakes, rivers and estuaries fouled with human and industrial waste, the need for revived wetlands is more urgent than ever. Waters from Lake Erie and Chesapeake Bay to China's Lake Taihu are tainted with an overload of nutrients carried in runoff from farms and cities, creating underwater dead zones and triggering algal blooms that release toxins into drinking water sources used by millions of people. As the planet warms, scientists are beginning to design wetlands that can shield coastal cities from rising seas. Revived wetlands hold great promise for healing the world's waters.},

	abstract = {A memoir of family, mining pioneers and unscrupulous magnates, and the fight for Minnesota's natural resources In 1855 the Merritt family arrived in Minnesota, where a descendant, Alfred, would one day become one of the "Seven Iron Men"--builders of the first mines to tap the state's great mineral wealth in the Mesabi Range. Another Merritt, more than half a century later, would lead the efforts to protect Lake Superior from damage caused by mining. Iron and Water is Grant J. Merritt's memoir of his life's work on behalf of Minnesota's people and environment and also the story of a significant family in state history. Merritt's family played a key role in the struggle over natural resources in Minnesota--for the enrichment of mining pioneers, the prosperity of the state and its people, and the prospect of a secure and healthy future. This complex tale begins with the adventure of discovering iron ore and building the mines, railroads, and docks to move it, then devolves into the intrigues of business partnerships gone bad and attempts by John D. Rockefeller to defraud the Merritts. What follows is an engrossing account of Grant Merritt's years in the halls of state politics and the trenches of environmental activism in defense of Minnesota's North Shore and Lake Superior's waters. The author's tenure as head of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency under Governor Wendell Anderson and his service on the first board of the Minnesota Environmental Quality Council take us behind the scenes of landmark legal cases and crucial moments in Minnesota history--particularly the notable Reserve Mining case, in which the company was found liable for serious environmental and health threats on the shores of Lake Superior and ordered to be shut down. In these pages we encounter the people who were critical to this history, from robber baron Rockefeller to judges, activists, and politicians, including Walter Mondale and Jim Oberstar. In chronicling both the discovery of vast iron deposits on the Mesabi Range and the fight to save Lake Superior and Minnesota's natural riches, Iron and Water reveals how, whether alone or together, individuals wield the power to change the world.},

Soybean yield loss is negatively correlated with the density of SCN eggs that are present in the soil. While there has been progress in automating extraction of egg-filled cysts and eggs from soil samples counting SCN eggs obtained from soil samples using computer vision techniques has proven to be an extremely difficult challenge. Here we show that a deep learning architecture developed for rare object identification in clutter-filled images can identify and count the SCN eggs. The architecture is trained with expert-labeled data to effectively build a machine learning model for quantifying SCN eggs via microscopic image analysis. We show dramatic improvements in the quantification time of eggs while maintaining human-level accuracy and avoiding inter-rater and intra-rater variabilities. The nematode eggs are correctly identified even in complex, debris-filled images that are often difficult for experts to identify quickly.

In this work, Caenorhabditis elegans was used as a biological model to assess the toxic effects of BPA, PPB, and TCS. The wild type strain, Bristol N2, was used in bioassays with the endpoints of lethality, growth, and reproduction; green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic strains with the hsp-3, hsp-4, hsp-16.2, hsp-70, sod-1, sod-4, cyp-35A4, cyp-29A2, and skn-1 genes were evaluated for their mRNA expression through fluorescence measurement; and quick Oil Red O (q ORO) was utilized to stain lipid deposits. Lethality was concentration-dependent, while TCS and PPB showed more toxicity than BPA. BPA augmented worm length, while PPB reduced it. All toxicants moderately increased the width and the width-length ratio. BPA and PPB promoted reproduction, in contrast to TCS, which diminished it. All toxicants affected the mRNA expression of genes related to cellular stress, control of reactive oxygen species, and nuclear receptor activation. Lipid accumulation occurred in exposed worms. In conclusion, BPA, PPB, and TCS alter the physiology of growth, lipid accumulation, and reproduction in C. elegans, most likely through oxidative stress mechanisms.},

There are about 1.8 million discovered and named plant and animal species, and millions more still to be discovered. Naming is the necessary next step after discovery; it is through the naming of species that we perceive and understand nature. Ohl explains the process, with examples, anecdotes, and a wildly varied cast of characters. He describes the rules for scientific naming; the vernacular isn't adequate. These rules--in standard binomial nomenclature, the generic name followed by specific name--go back to Linnaeus; but they are open to idiosyncrasy and individual expression. A lizard is designated
Barbaturex morrisoni (in honor of the Doors' Jim Morrison, the Lizard King); a member of the horsefly family
Scaptia beyonceae. Ohl, a specialist in "winged things that sting," confesses that among the many wasp species he has named is
Ampulex dementor, after the dementors in the Harry Potter novels. Scientific names have also been deployed by scientists to insult other scientists, to make political statements, and as expressions of romantic love: "I shall name this beetle after my beloved wife."

The Art of Naming takes us on a surprising and fascinating journey, in the footsteps of the discoverers of species and the authors of names, into the nooks and crannies and drawers and cabinets of museums, and through the natural world of named and not-yet-named species.},

	abstract = {The present paper details a very diverse non-marine gastropod fauna retrieved from Caspian Pleistocene deposits along the Volga River north of Astrakhan (Russia). During time of deposition (early Late Pleistocene, late Khazarian regional substage), the area was situated in shallow water of the greatly expanded Caspian Sea. The fauna contains 24 species, of which 16 are endemic to the Pontocaspian region and 15 to the Caspian Sea. The majority of the species (13) belongs to the Pyrgulinae ( Hydrobiidae ), a group famous for its huge morphological variability in the Pontocaspian region. The phenotypic diversity has led to an inflation of genus and species names in the literature. New concepts are proposed for many of the genera and species found in the present material, with implications for the systematics and taxonomy of the entire Pontocaspian gastropod fauna.  Laevicaspia vinarskii  sp. n. is described as a new species. This contribution is considered a first step in revising the Pontocaspian gastropod fauna.},

We used flow cytometric fingerprinting and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess the impact of time on community structure in one hundred synthetic ecosystems of fixed richness but varying initial evenness. Both methodologies uncovered a similar reduction in diversity within synthetic communities of medium and high initial evenness classes. However, the results of amplicon sequencing showed that there were no significant differences between and within the communities in all evenness groups at the end of the experiment. Nevertheless, initial evenness significantly impacted the cell density of the community after five medium transfers. Highly even communities retained the highest cell densities at the end of the experiment. The relative abundances of individual species could be associated to particular evenness groups, suggesting that their presence was dependent on the initial evenness of the synthetic community. Our results reveal that using synthetic communities for testing ecological hypotheses requires prior assessment of initial evenness, as it impacts temporal dynamics.},

	abstract = {This handbook provides a comprehensive but concise reference resource for the vast field of petroleum technology. Built on the successful book "Practical Advances in Petroleum Processing" published in 2006, it has been extensively revised and expanded to include upstream technologies. The book is divided into four parts: The first part on petroleum characterization offers an in-depth review of the chemical composition and physical properties of petroleum, which determine the possible uses and the quality of the products. The second part provides a brief overview of petroleum geology and upstream practices. The third part exhaustively discusses established and emerging refining technologies from a practical perspective, while the final part describes the production of various refining products, including fuels and lubricants, as well as petrochemicals, such as olefins and polymers. It also covers process automation and real-time refinery-wide process optimization. Two key chapters provide an integrated view of petroleum technology, including environmental and safety issues. 
Written by international experts from academia, industry and research institutions, including integrated oil companies, catalyst suppliers, licensors, and consultants, it is an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students as well as practitioners and professionals.Comprehensively describes all aspects of petroleum technology, including exploration, transportation and refining of petroleum and natural gas Provides an extensive and comprehensive review of state-of-the-art techniques and technologies used in the industry Offers a reference resource for the oil-refining and petrochemical-production businesses
Dr. Chang Samuel Hsu had over 32 year experience at ExxonMobil and BP before joining in Florida State University six years ago to establish the Future Fuels Institute. He also established the Refinery of the Future Lab at BP. Currently, he is an Adjunct Professor at Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering of Florida A\&M University/Florida State University and also at College of Chemical Engineering of China University of Petroleum in Beijing. In 2012, he founded Petro Bio Consulting, LLC. Dr. Hsu was the first researcher to introduce ultrahigh resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) for in-depth molecular characterization of petroleum fractions.  He was one of the pioneers to develop tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) at Exxon to provide an additional dimension for the determination of molecular structure of the components in complex mixtures.  Dr. Hsu's research interest covers petroleum (both upstream and downstream), coal, shale and biomass oils. His current focuses are novel characterization of petroleum biomarkers for exploration and exploitation, and heavy hydrocarbon characterization for hydroprocessing, catalytic cracking, coking and fuels/lubes analyses. He also has extensive experience in environmental damage assessment and remediation for oil spills.
Dr. Paul Robinson earned BS (Honors) and MA degrees at the University of Missouri at Columbia. He spent a year at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, then moved to the University of California at San Diego, which rewarded him with a PhD in Chemistry. After two years as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, he began his long career in energy, starting at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where he studied hydrogen energy systems. Subsequently, at the Science and Technology Division of Unocal Corporation, he became involved in catalysis research. He earned several patents, some for commercial catalysts. While working for Unocal, Chevron, and Shell, he was involved in many aspects of refining and most aspects of hydrotreating and hydrocracking. He is most pleased with the work he did in support of online refinery-wide optimization at Suncor Sarnia. During his career in industry, he won several special recognition awards, including two creativity awards and a patent achievement award from Unocal. From 2014 to 2016, he served as Chief Technology Advisor for the VCC process at KBR Inc. In 2016, Paul R. Robinson founded the Katy Institute for Sustainable Energy, a non-profit organization devoted to stimulating science-based dialog on energy.  His credentials include 11 patents, 80 technical publications, a wonderful family, and a black belt in TaeKwonDo.},

	abstract = {We studied contribution of benthic invertebrates to the dissolved phosphates flux from the bottom sediments to the water in an oligotrophic lake (Lake Krivoe, near the White Sea biological station "Kartesh", Northern European Russia) in 2009-2013 with the aim to quantify specific (among and within taxa), spatial (littoral and deep sites) and seasonal variability. The excretion rates (Pexc) of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were estimated in experiment with dominating taxa of benthic invertebrates (amphipods, oligochaetes, mollusks, and chironomids), freshly collected from the lake. Mass-specific P excretion rate was calculated as Pexc divided by animal dry mass and further used for calculations of benthic P efflux rates. Also, in other experimental series with and without animals (amphipods) we measured extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity. The results showed that the SRP excretion rates varied significantly between taxa and between different-sized individuals within the same taxa (the SRP excretion rate elevates with an increase in individual weight). Notable spatial and seasonal differences in biomass of benthic animals and phosphorus released by them in the lake were found. The calculated phosphorus efflux by excretory activity of benthic animals was more intensive in littoral sites (up to 14.4 nmol m-2d-1 in July), that 7 times greater than maximum efflux in deep areas (2.2 nmol m-2d-1). The mobile burrowing animals (the amphipods Gammarus lacustris, Monoporeia affinis, and Gammaracanthus loricatus) are able to move from the bottom sediments to water and transfer the nutrient; they contributed 80 \% of P flux caused by benthic excretion in the lake and affected the activity of the extracellular alkaline phosphatase, increasing its level in water 3-8 times relative to that in the control (without animals). The high phosphatase activity may increase phosphorus bioavailability by catalyzing hydrolysis of organic phosphorus, and further stimulate primary producers.},

	abstract = {Network robustness against attacks has been widely studied in fields as diverse as the Internet, power grids and human societies. But current definition of robustness is only accounting for half of the story: the connectivity of the nodes unaffected by the attack. Here we propose a new framework to assess network robustness, wherein the connectivity of the affected nodes is also taken into consideration, acknowledging that it plays a crucial role in properly evaluating the overall network robustness in terms of its future recovery from the attack. Specifically, we propose a dual perspective approach wherein at any instant in the network evolution under attack, two distinct networks are defined: (i) the Active Network (AN) composed of the unaffected nodes and (ii) the Idle Network (IN) composed of the affected nodes. The proposed robustness metric considers both the efficiency of destroying the AN and that of building-up the IN. We show, via analysis of well-known prototype networks and real world data, that trade-offs between the efficiency of Active and Idle Network dynamics give rise to surprising robustness crossovers and re-rankings, which can have significant implications for decision making.},

	abstract = {Nanostructures for Antimicrobial Therapy discusses the pros and cons of the use of nanostructured materials in the prevention and eradication of infections, highlighting the efficient microbicidal effect of nanoparticles against antibiotic-resistant pathogens and biofilms. 
Conventional antibiotics are becoming ineffective towards microorganisms due to their widespread and often inappropriate use. As a result, the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms is increasingly being reported. New approaches are needed to confront the rising issues related to infectious diseases. The merging of biomaterials, such as chitosan, carrageenan, gelatin, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) with nanotechnology provides a promising platform for antimicrobial therapy as it provides a controlled way to target cells and induce the desired response without the adverse effects common to many traditional treatments.
Nanoparticles represent one of the most promising therapeutic treatments to the problem caused by infectious micro-organisms resistant to traditional therapies. This volume discusses this promise in detail, and also discusses what challenges the greater use of nanoparticles might pose to medical professionals. The unique physiochemical properties of nanoparticles, combined with their growth inhibitory capacity against microbes has led to the upsurge in the research on nanoparticles as antimicrobials. The importance of bactericidal nanobiomaterials study will likely increase as development of resistant strains of bacteria against most potent antibiotics continues.

Shows how nanoantibiotics can be used to more effectively treat disease
Discusses the advantages and issues of a variety of different nanoantibiotics, enabling medics to select which best meets their needs

	abstract = {Living on a damaged planet challenges who we are and where we live. This timely anthology calls on twenty eminent humanists and scientists to revitalize curiosity, observation, and transdisciplinary conversation about life on earth. As human-induced environmental change threatens multispecies livability, Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet puts forward a bold proposal: entangled histories, situated narratives, and thick descriptions offer urgent "arts of living." Included are essays by scholars in anthropology, ecology, science studies, art, literature, and bioinformatics who posit critical and creative tools for collaborative survival in a more-than-human Anthropocene. The essays are organized around two key figures that also serve as the publication's two openings: Ghosts, or landscapes haunted by the violences of modernity; and Monsters, or interspecies and intraspecies sociality. Ghosts and Monsters are tentacular, windy, and arboreal arts that invite readers to encounter ants, lichen, rocks, electrons, flying foxes, salmon, chestnut trees, mud volcanoes, border zones, graves, radioactive waste--in short, the wonders and terrors of an unintended epoch.

The aim of this work was to characterize the iLBP gene family of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, one of the most cultivated marine bivalves in the world, using bioinformatics and molecular biology approaches. A total of 26 different iLBPs transcripts were identified in the Pacific oyster genome, including alternative splicing and gene duplication events. The oyster iLBP gene family seems to be more expanded than in other invertebrates. Furthermore, 3D structural modeling and molecular docking analysis mapped the main amino acids involved in ligand interactions, and comparisons to available protein structures from vertebrate families revealed new binding cavities. Ten different CgiLBPs were analyzed by quantitative PCR in various tissues of C. gigas, which suggested differential prevalent gene expression of CgiLBPs among tissue groups. The data indicate a wider repertoire of iLBPs in labial palps, a food-sorting tissue. The different gene transcription profiles and reported docking systems suggest that the iLBPs are a non-generalist ligand binding protein family with specific functions.},

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a rapid and efficient method for developing molecular markers. However, transcriptomic and genomic resources of R. padi have not been investigated. In this study, we used transcriptome information obtained by RNA-Seq to develop polymorphic microsatellites for investigating population genetics in this species. The transcriptome of R. padi was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 114.4 million raw reads with a GC content of 40.03\% was generated. The raw reads were cleaned and assembled into 29,467 unigenes with an N50 length of 1,580 bp. Using several public databases, 82.47\% of these unigenes were annotated. Of the annotated unigenes, 8,022 were assigned to COG pathways, 9,895 were assigned to GO pathways, and 14,586 were mapped to 257 KEGG pathways. A total of 7,936 potential microsatellites were identified in 5,564 unigenes, 60 of which were selected randomly and amplified using specific primer pairs. Fourteen loci were found to be polymorphic in the four R. padi populations. The transcriptomic data presented herein will facilitate gene discovery, gene analyses, and development of molecular markers for future studies of R. padi and other closely related aphid species.},

All the possible problems in each part of the irrigation system will be analyzed in the following paper, proposing several solutions to avoid these problems or mitigate its consequences. These solutions go from the simple maintenance of pipes and valeus to the implementation of more sophisticated systems, such as SCADA, or management strategies, such as benchmarking.},

	abstract = {In nature, trickery and deception are widespread. Animals and plants mimic other objects or species in the environment for protection, trick other species into rearing their young, lure prey to their death, and deceive potential mates for reproduction. Cuckoos lay eggs carefully matched to their host's own clutch. Harmless butterflies mimic the wing patterning of a poisonous butterfly to avoid being eaten. The deep-sea angler fish hangs a glowing, fleshy lure infront of its mouth to draw the attention of potential prey, while some male fish alter their appearance to look like females in order to sneak past rivals in mating. Some orchids develop the smell of female insects in order to attract pollinators, while carnivorous plants lure insects to their death withcolourful displays.In this book, Martin Stevens describes the remarkable range of such adaptations in nature, and considers how they have evolved, and become increasingly perfected as part of an arms race between predator and prey or host and parasite. He explores the work of naturalists and biologists from Alfred Russel Wallace to current research, showing how scientists find ways of testing the impact of particular behaviours and colourings on the animals it is meant to fool, as opposed to our humanperceptions. Drawing on a wide range of examples, Stevens considers what deception tells us about the process of evolution and adaptation.},

To date, repeated studies have found that parasites and heavy metals or metalloids both have important negative effects on the health of animals, often in a synergistic manner. Here, we show for the first time that parasites can increase host resistance to metalloid arsenic, focusing on a clonal population of brine shrimp from the contaminated Odiel and Tinto estuary in SW Spain. We studied the effect of cestodes on the response of Artemia to arsenic (acute toxicity tests, 24h LC50) and found that infection consistently reduced mortality across a range of arsenic concentrations. An increase from 25°C to 29°C, simulating the change in mean temperature expected under climate change, increased arsenic toxicity, but the benefits of infection persisted. Infected individuals showed higher levels of catalase and glutathione reductase activity, antioxidant enzymes with a very important role in the protection against oxidative stress. Levels of TBARS were unaffected by parasites, suggesting that infection is not associated with oxidative damage. Moreover, infected Artemia had a higher number of carotenoid-rich lipid droplets which may also protect the host through the "survival of the fattest" principle and the antioxidant potential of carotenoids. This study illustrates the need to consider the multi-stress context (contaminants and temperature increase) in which host-parasite interactions occur.},

	abstract = {Background


Advances in acoustic telemetry technology have led to an improved understanding of the spatial ecology of many freshwater and marine fish species. Understanding the performance of acoustic receivers is necessary to distinguish between tagged fish that may have been present but not detected and from those fish that were absent from the area. In this study, two stationary acoustic transmitters were deployed 250 m apart within each of four acoustic receiver lines each containing at least 10 receivers (i.e., eight acoustic transmitters) located in Saginaw Bay and central Lake Huron for nearly 2 years to determine whether the probability of detecting an acoustic transmission varied as a function of time (i.e., season), location, and distance between acoustic transmitter and receiver. Distances between acoustic transmitters and receivers ranged from 200 m to {\textgreater}10 km in each line. The daily observed probability of detecting an acoustic transmission was used in simulation models to estimate the probability of detecting a moving acoustic transmitter on a line of receivers.


Results


The probability of detecting an acoustic transmitter on a receiver 1000 m away differed by month for different receiver lines in Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay but was similar for paired acoustic transmitters deployed 250 m apart within the same line. Mean probability of detecting an acoustic transmitter at 1000 m calculated over the study period varied among acoustic transmitters 250 m apart within a line and differed among receiver lines in Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay. The simulated probability of detecting a moving acoustic transmitter on a receiver line was characterized by short periods of time with decreased detection. Although increased receiver spacing and higher fish movement rates decreased simulated detection probability, the location of the simulated receiver line in Lake Huron had the strongest effect on simulated detection probability.


Conclusions


Performance of receiver lines in Lake Huron varied across a range of spatiotemporal scales and was inconsistent among receiver lines. Our simulations indicated that if 69 kHz acoustic transmitters operating at 158 dB in 10-30 m of freshwater were being used, then receivers should be placed 1000 m apart to ensure that all fish moving at 1 m s-1 or less will be detected 90\% of days over a 2-year period. Whereas these results can be used as general guidelines for designing new studies, the irregular variation in acoustic transmitter detection probabilities we observed among receiver line locations in Lake Huron makes designing receiver lines in similar systems challenging and emphasizes the need to conduct post hoc analyses of acoustic transmitter detection probabilities.},

	abstract = {Background               The expression of animal personality is indicated by patterns of consistency in individual behaviour. Often, the differences exhibited between individuals are consistent across situations. However, between some situations, this can be biased by variable levels of individual plasticity. The interaction between individual plasticity and animal personality can be illustrated by examining situation-sensitive personality traits such as boldness (i.e. risk-taking and exploration tendency). For the weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii, light condition is a major factor influencing behaviour. Adapted to navigate in low-light conditions, this species chooses to be more active in dark environments where risk from visual predators is lower. However, G. petersii also exhibit individual differences in their degree of behavioural change from light to dark. The present study, therefore, aims to examine if an increase of motivation to explore in the safety of the dark, not only affects mean levels of boldness, but also the variation between individuals, as a result of differences in individual plasticity.               Results               Boldness was consistent between a novel-object and a novel-environment situation in bright light. However, no consistency in boldness was noted between a bright (risky) and a dark (safe) novel environment. Furthermore, there was a negative association between boldness and the degree of change across novel environments, with shier individuals exhibiting greater behavioural plasticity.               Conclusions               This study highlights that individual plasticity can vary with personality. In addition, the effect of light suggests that variation in boldness is situation specific. Finally, there appears to be a trade-off between personality and individual plasticity with shy but plastic individuals minimizing costs when perceiving risk and bold but stable individuals consistently maximizing rewards, which can be maladaptive.},

	abstract = {The Real Thing is the first official biography of Ian McTaggart Cowan (1910-2010), the "father of Canadian ecology." Authorized by his family and with the research support and participation of the University of Victoria Libraries, Briony Penn provides an unprecedented and accessible window into the story of this remarkable naturalist. From his formative years roaming the mountains around Vancouver looking for venison to his last years finishing the voluminous and authoritative Birds of British Columbia, Cowan's life provides a unique perspective on a century of environmental change--with a critical message for the future. As the head and founder of the first university-based wildlife department in Canada, Ian McTaggart Cowan revolutionized the way North Americans understood the natural world, and students flocked into his classrooms to hear his brilliant, entertaining lectures regarding the new science of ecology. During his academic career, Ian McTaggart Cowan stepped outside the narrow confines of academia to pioneer nature television. His television programs in the 1950s and '60s, Fur and Feathers, The Web of Life and The Living Sea, made him a household name around the world by capturing the first microscopic organisms on TV and bringing a live moose into the studio. He was also responsible for hiring a young David Suzuki, who followed in his nature-show-host footsteps. Cowan's early work in the national parks became the foundation for wildlife conservation and environmental education in Canada. And like his US counterpart and colleague Aldo Leopold, he was part of a secret fraternity that practised a reverence for wildness and influenced three generations of scientists and politicians on everything from conservation of endangered species to the dangers of pesticides and climate change, long before these topics were generally acknowledged. In his 80s he was still pioneering new ways to communicate nature through ecotourism, and well into his 90s he was still mentoring young ecologists. Cowan's last publication at age 91 was the final volume of Birds of British Columbia, which the Royal BC Museum called "one of the biggest publishing events in Canadian history." Illustrated throughout with colour and black-and-white photos from all aspects of Cowan's life, The Real Thing takes the reader on an adventurous and inspirational journey through the heart of North American ecology, wilderness, landscape and wonder.},

	abstract = {The Great Brak is a temporarily open/closed estuary (TOCE) located on the south coast of South Africa. The construction of the Wolwedans Dam in 1989 reduced baseflow to the estuary by 56\%, decreasing the intensity of flushing events and causing t he mouth to breach less often. The aim of t his study was to investigate the flux of inorganic nutrients (NH{\textasciicircum}sup +{\textasciicircum}{\textasciicircum}sub 4{\textasciicircum}, TOxN [NO{\textasciicircum}sup -{\textasciicircum}{\textasciicircum}sub 3{\textasciicircum} + NO{\textasciicircum}sup -{\textasciicircum}{\textasciicircum}sub 2{\textasciicircum}], SRP) as well as total N and P across the sediment-water interface in the estuary. There have been very few studies on nutrient cycling and benthic pelagic coupling in South African estuaries. This study showed t hat t he sediment had a net efflux of NH{\textasciicircum}sup +{\textasciicircum}{\textasciicircum}sub 4{\textasciicircum}, SRP, TN and TP while TOx N was taken up or converted to other forms of N. The estuary acted as a source of N and P during both summer and w inter. If the estuary remains closed for a prolonged period (12 months), with an increased organic load present on the bent hos, the associated rates of efflux of N and P would increase. In order to reduce the organic load to the system better flushing met hods or, more importantly, a n increase in base flow, is needed to reduce residence times of water in the estuary.},

	abstract = {Composed of nearly a thousand different types of micro-organisms, some beneficial, others not, the human gut microbiota plays an important role in health and disease. This is due to the presence of probiotic or beneficial microbes, or due to the feeding of prebiotics that stimulate the endogenous beneficial microbes: these promote health by stimulating the immune system, improving the digestion and absorption of nutrients, and inhibiting the growth of pathogens. The notable health benefits of probiotic organisms have stimulated much commercial interest, which in turn has led to a plethora of research initiatives in this area; these range from studies to elucidate the efficacy of the various health benefits to analyses of the diet-microbe interaction as a means of modulating the gut microbiota composition. Research in this area is at a very exciting stage. With state-of-the-art commentaries on all aspects of probiotics and prebiotics research, this book provides an authoritative and timely overview of the field. Written by leading international researchers, each chapter affords a critical insight to a particular topic, reviews current research, discusses future direction and aims to stimulate discussion. Topics range from the different microorganisms used as probiotics (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, yeast, etc) and techniques and approaches used (metagenomics, etc) to the reviews of the clinical and medical aspects. The provision of extensive reference sections positively encourages readers to pursue each subject in greater detail. Containing 33 chapters, the book is an invaluable source of information and essential reading for everyone working with probiotics, prebiotics and the gut microbiota, from the PhD student to the experienced scientist, in academia, the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries and working in clinical environments.},

	abstract = {Lake Tenkiller located in Oklahoma, USA is a large midcontinent reservoir in a eutrophic state due to excess phosphorus (P) loads. Poultry waste application within the Illinois River Watershed in northeast Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas has been identified as a major contributor to overall P loads within Lake Tenkiller. In this study, Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems (GLEAMS) was applied to evaluate the effect of poultry waste application on P loads to Lake Tenkiller. Historical P loads to Lake Tenkiller during 1951-2000 have increased from approximately 166,000 kg/year to more than 295,000 kg/year with the Illinois River at Tahlequah subwatershed increasing from 68\% to 78\% of total P loads over that period. Increased poultry waste application based on poultry growth rates could increase P load to Lake Tenkiller from 311,000 kg/year to more than 528,000 kg/year. Cessation of poultry waste application and addition of buffers along streams could reduce P loads to approximately 92,000 kg/year for cessation of poultry waste application alone and about 89,000 kg/year for cessation of poultry waste application with buffers. One possible strategy to reduce P load to Lake Tenkiller is to cease applying poultry waste application, especially in the portion of the Illinois River above the Tahlequah USGS gage station.},

This was as a result of elevated levels of the toxin microcystin in the final treated water, a dangerous toxin produced by the algae cyanobacteria. The Toledo water crisis is a key focusing event that can advance dialogue on eutrophication governance in the context of public health. This paper examines the Toledo water ban with the aim of determining whether this crisis could have been averted. Further, we explore how this event can be used to stimulate action on eutrophication governance, to motivate action to protect water at its source. We use the World Health Organization's Water Safety Planning Methodology to show that the crisis could have been averted with some simple risk management actions. We also show that a water safety planning approach could lead to well developed operational and maintenance planning resulting in a higher probability of safe drinking water.},

Here we present long-term (1973-2010) field patterns for Lake Erie yellow perch, Perca flavescens, which show that failed annual recruitment events followed short, warm winters. Subsequent laboratory experimentation and field investigations revealed how reduced reproductive success following short, warm winters underlie these observed field patterns. Following short winters, females spawn at warmer temperatures and produce smaller eggs that both hatch at lower rates and produce smaller larvae than females exposed to long winters. Our research suggests that continued climate warming can lead to unanticipated, negative effects on temperate fish populations.},

Enchytraeus crypticus (Oligochatea), was exposed to the reproduction effect concentrations EC20/50 of several Cu and Ag materials (CuNO3, Cu-Field, Cu-Nwires and Cu-NPs; AgNO3, Ag NM300K, Ag-NPs Non-coated and Ag-NPs PVP-coated) for 7 days (0-3-7d). The parameters measured were the total energy reserves available (protein, carbohydrate and lipid budgets) and the energy consumption (Ec) integrated to obtain the CEA. Results showed that these parameters allowed a clear discrimination between Cu and Ag, but less clearly within each of the various materials. For Cu there was an increase in Ec and protein budget, while for Ag a decrease was observed. The results corroborate known mechanisms, e.g., with Cu causing an increase in metabolic rate whereas Ag induces mitochondrial damage. The various Cu forms seem to activate different mechanisms with size and shape (e.g., Cu-NPs versus Cu-Nwires), causing clearly different effects. For Ag, results are in line with a slower oxidation rate of Ag-NMs in comparison with Ag-salt and hence delayed effects.},

They are important to the scientific community for many reasons, the most obvious being that they pose food safety issues, and regularly monitoring the presence of these compounds in foods requires a large investment. 

Phycotoxins: Chemistry and Biochemistry, second edition presents the most updated information available on phycotoxins. Major emphases are given to chemistry and biochemistry, and origins, mechanisms of action, toxicology and analytical methodology are also covered.
Since the publication of the first edition, there have been major advances in the science of marine and aquatic toxins, as well as advances in toxicology, analytical chemistry and pharmacology. This fully revised and updated edition includes several new chapters, including those on ciguatoxins, pinnatoxin and ichthyotoxins, as well as new chapters on food safety control of marine toxins, climate change and water toxins, and microalgae as a source of nutraceuticals.
The book will be of interest to toxicologists, marine, food and plant scientists, as well as researchers and academics in the areas of food science, medicine, public health, toxicology, pharmacology and marine biology.

	abstract = {The American Association for the Advancement of Science's report on Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education suggests that instructors "can no longer rely solely on trying to cover a syllabus packed with topics" but rather should "introduce fewer concepts but present them in greater depth." They further suggest that the principles embodied in a set of core concepts and competencies should be the basis for all undergraduate biology courses, including those designed for nonmajors.The theme of Tools for Critical Thinking in Biology will be the first and most fundamental of these competencies: the ability to apply the process of science. Biology courses and curricula must engage students in how scientific inquiry is conducted, including evaluating and interpreting scientific explanations of the natural world. The book uses diverse examples to illustrate how experiments work, how hypotheses can be tested by systematic and comparative observations when experiments aren't possible, how models are useful in science, and how sound decisions can be based on the weight of evidence even when uncertainty remains. These are fundamental issues in the process of science that are important for everyone to understand, whether they pursue careers in science or not. Where other introductory biology textbooks are organized by scientific concepts, Tools for Critical Thinking in Biology will instead show how methods can be used to test hypotheses in fields as different as ecology and medicine, using contemporary case studies. The book will provide students with a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of such methods for answering new questions, and will thereby change the way they think about the fundamentals of biology.},

Chief among these advances are in the areas of stem cell development, signaling pathways, the role of inflammation in the regulatory processes in the various tissues, and the integration of new animal models which have led to a greater understanding of human disease. The new edition synthesizes all of this new information at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels of organization and present modern physiology a more understandable and comparative context. 
The Fourth Edition has been extensively revised, reflecting new fundamental advancements in this rapidly advancing field.Provides a common language for researchers across the fields of physiology, endocrinology, and biology to discuss their understanding of reproduction.Saves academic researchers time in quickly accessing the very latest details on reproductive physiology, as opposed to searching through thousands of journal articles.},

	abstract = {Online monitoring of water quality is an powerful enabler in the water industry. It is a crucial component in the pro-active management of processes and assets, and helps improve performance and cost efficiency. Instrumentation for the monitoring of most water quality parameters is commercially available. Implementation of such equipment, however, remains largely limited to a small number of basic parameters and is still confined to key nodes in collection, treatment and distribution systems. A primary hurdle to further realization of the potential of online monitoring is the lack of publicly available information on system performance, key drivers and barriers (technical, economic and social) to successful implementation. A study was performed to identify and document information on commercially available instrument types, associated costs (capital and operating), and real-world experiences with the use of sensors in the global water / wastewater industry. This information was compiled in an online compendium, to facilitate sharing of information and learning from experience. The study has shown that the current generation of technology is suitable for routine operation. However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to monitoring questions. Furthermore, successful application of on-line water quality monitoring requires commitment of considerable resources, which need to be accompanied by a solid QA/QC plan. Furthermore, the understanding and appreciation of monitoring and the efforts required to make it a success need to be embedded and supported at all levels within an organization. Deciding whether on-line monitoring is the best solution to a need for information has to be done in careful process. Defining needs and requirements, building a business case around this and then carefully working out the specifications and all organizational aspects of the monitoring program are prerequisites for effective implementation and to prevent surprises and disappointment.},

	abstract = {Many freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems across the world may have undergone an ecosystem regime change due to a combination of rising anthropogenic disturbances and regional climate change. Such a change in aquatic ecosystems is commonly seen as shifts in algal species. But considerably less detail is known about the eutrophication history in terms of changes in algal productivity, particularly for a large lake with a great deal of spatial variability. Here we present an analysis of trace metals (Cu, Ni, Cd, and Pb) on a sediment core recovered from Lake Erie, off the Vermilion coast of northern Ohio, USA, to reconstruct the eutrophication history of the lake over the past 210 years. Following a slow eutrophication during European settlement, Lake Erie experienced a period of accelerated eutrophication, leading to an ecosystem regime transition into a eutrophic lake state in 1950. Our results suggested that the lake's biological productivity has ever since maintained fairly high even though a significant input reduction was realized from rigorous nutrient abatements that began as early as in 1969. This work underscored the role of in-lake biogeochemical cycling in nutrient dynamics of this already eutrophic lake.},

	abstract = {This paper seeks to identify the biomarker response to oxidative stress in Astyanax bimaculatus, a freshwater fish, collected from the Una River and its associated water bodies. The fish were collected using fishing nets at three different points on the river basin, namely Fazenda Piloto (FP), Ipiranga (IP) and Remédios (RM), during the period from December 2013 to March 2014. Physical and chemical analyses of the water at the sample locations indicate that IP and RM possibly have larger concentration of either natural or anthropic pollutants as compared to FP. FP can therefore be considered as the point less impacted by pollutants than other points. Hepatic activity of antioxidant stress enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), were measured in the specimens. The levels of SOD were reduced at RM while they were elevated in fish collected at IP. The CAT levels for the fish at RM and IP were about 148.9\% and 202.4\% above the values at FP, respectively. These results suggest that antioxidant enzymes could be used as biomarkers to measure oxidative stress caused by pollutants in the Una River Basin.},

However, the behavioural contexts and taxa in which social network structure has been described are still limited because such studies require extensive data. Here, we highlight the use of an automated passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tag monitoring system for social network analyses and do so in a novel context--nestling provisioning in an avian cooperative breeder, for which direct observation of social behaviours is difficult. First, we used observers and cameras to arrive at a suitable metric of nest visit synchrony in the PIT-tag data. Second, we validated the use of this metric for social network analyses using internal nest video cameras. Third, we used hierarchical regression models with 'sociality' parameter to investigate structure of networks collected from multiple groups. Use of PIT tags led to nest visitation duration and frequency being obtained with a high degree of accuracy for all group members, except for the breeding female for whom accurate estimations required the use of a video camera due to her high variability in visitation time. The PIT-tag dataset uncovered significant variability in social network structure. Our results highlight the importance of combining complementary observation methods when conducting social network analyses of wild animals. Our methods can also be generalised to multiple contexts in social systems wherever repeated encounters with other individuals in closed space have ecological implications.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {The challenges faced by environmental scientists today are vast, complex, and multi-faceted.  For instance, predicting the fate of an environmental pollutant or understanding ecosystem responses to climate change, necessitate a firm understanding of molecular structure and dynamics of environmental media as well as the components that exist and interact within this media.  Furthermore, linking information obtained at the molecular-scale to ecosystem-level processes is a major pursuit of modern environmental research.  As such, NMR spectroscopy and its scalability from the molecular-scale to the macroscopic-scale, is facilitating rapid growth in environmental science. In addition, the versatility of NMR spectroscopy has resulted in the development and implementation of different types of NMR techniques to examine the structure of various types of environmental samples, living and non-living, as well as the study of critical environmental processes.

This comprehensive handbook is a collection of chapters that span from methods to how NMR is used in environmental research to gain insight into various ecosystem properties.
It is organized into three parts:


Part A focuses on methods used in environmental NMR which span from solution-state to magnetic resonance imaging.

Part B emphasizes how NMR spectroscopy plays an essential role in understanding various types of environmental components and related processes, including different forms of organic matter found in soil, water, and air as well as how NMR is used to probe the fate of water, organic pollutants, and metals in the environment.

Part C focuses on the growing field of environmental metabolomics which uses NMR as its main discovery platform.
This volume highlights the immense potential of NMR spectroscopy to expand our fundamental understanding of environmental processes and how it will continue to do so well into the future.

Environmental chemistry research
Our research group studies environmental processes at the molecular-level. We use advanced analytical tools (namely mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) to understand the structure and environmental reactivity of natural organic matter found in soils, sediments, water, and ice.
We use advanced analytical tools to study the stability of natural organic matter with climate change.  We also study the sorption mechanisms of problematic organic contaminants to soils and sediments.  We are developing novel environmental metabolomic methods for the rapid and quantitative risk assessment of contaminated soil and water.
The overall goal of our research is to improve the fundamental understanding of environmental processes at the molecular-level. By doing so, we hope to increase the knowledge of several environmental processes and directly apply this knowledge to solve pressing environmental problems.

Today, with the increase in knowledge and available databases on food safety issues, the world is witnessing tremendous efforts towards the development of new, economical and environmentally-friendly techniques for maintaining the quality of perishable foods and agro-based commodities. The intensification of food safety concerns reflects a major global awareness of foods in world trade. Several recommendations have been put forward by various world governing bodies and committees to solve food safety issues, which are all mainly targeted at benefiting consumers. In addition, economic losses and instability to a particular nation or region caused by food safety issues can be huge. Various 'non-dependent' risk factors can be involved with regard to food safety in a wide range of food commodities such as fresh fruits, vegetables, seafood, poultry, meat and meat products. Additionally, food safety issues involves a wide array of issues  including processed foods, packaging, post-harvest preservation, microbial growth and spoilage, food poisoning, handling at the manufacturing units, food additives, presence of banned chemicals and drugs, and more. Rapid change in climatic conditions is also playing a pivotal role with regard to food safety issues, and increasing the anxiety about our ability to feed the world safely. 

Practical Food Safety: Contemporary Issues and Future Directions takes a multi-faceted approach to the subject of food safety, covering various aspects ranging from microbiological to chemical issues, and from basic knowledge to future perspectives. This is a book exclusively designed to simultaneously encourage consideration of the present knowledge and future possibilities of food safety. This book also covers the classic topics required for all books on food safety, and encompasses the most recent updates in the field. Leading researchers have addressed new issues and have put forth novel research findings that will affect the world in the future, and suggesting how these should be faced.
This book will be useful for researchers engaged in the field of food science and food safety, food industry personnel engaged in safety aspects, and governmental and non-governmental agencies involved in establishing guidelines towards establishing safety measures for food and agricultural commodities.

	abstract = {Symbiosis between Fishes and Invertebrates provides comprehensive coverage of the biology of partnerships between fishes and invertebrates, ascending the phylogenetic scale, from luminescent bacteria, sponges and coelenterates to molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms. Both facultative and obligatory partnerships are reviewed with emphasis on the behavioral, ecological and evolutionary aspects of fish symbiosis. Each of the eight chapters of this book focuses on a different group of partners. The structure, physiology and anti-predatory strategies of each group are described to provide the necessary background for the understanding of their partnerships with fishes. The formation of the associations, the degree of partner specificity and its regulation, as well as the benefits and costs for the fishes and their associates, communication between partners and their possible co-evolution are discussed in each chapter. This is the first attempt to critically review in a single volume all associations of fishes with invertebrates based on the latest studies in these areas, together with studies published many years ago and little cited since then. Symbiosis between Fishes and Invertebrates provides a huge wealth of information that will be of great use and interest to many life scientists including fish biologists, ecologists, ethologists, aquatic scientists, physiologists and evolutionary biologists. It is hoped that the contents of the book will stimulate many to further research, to fill in the gaps in our knowledge in this fascinating and important subject. Libraries in all universities and research establishments where biological sciences are studied and taught should have copies of this exciting book.Symbiosis between Fishes and Invertebrates provides comprehensive coverage of the biology of partnerships between fishes and invertebrates, ascending the phylogenetic scale, from luminescent bacteria, sponges and coelenterates to molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms.

	abstract = {Now in its fourth edition, "Principles of Tissue Engineering" has been the definite resource in the field of tissue engineering for more than a decade. The fourth edition provides an update on this rapidly progressing field, combining the prerequisites for a general understanding of tissue growth and development, the tools and theoretical information needed to design tissues and organs, as well as a presentation by the worldOCOs experts of what is currently known about each specific organ system. As in previous editions, this book creates a comprehensive work that strikes a balance among the diversity of subjects that are related to tissue engineering, including biology, chemistry, material science, and engineering, among others, while also emphasizing those research areas that are likely to be of clinical value in the future. 
This edition includes greatly expanded focus on stem cells, including induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, stem cell niches, and blood components from stem cells. This research has already produced applications in disease modeling, toxicity testing, drug development, and clinical therapies.a This up-to-date coverage of stem cell biology and other emerging technologies OCosuch as brain-machine interfaces for controlling bionics and neuroprosthesesOCo is complemented by a series of new and updated chapters on recent clinical experience in applying tissue engineering, as well as a new section on the application of tissue-engineering techniques for food production. The result is a comprehensive textbook that will be useful to students and experts alike.
Includes new chapters on biomaterial-protein interactions, nanocomposite and three-dimensional scaffolds, skin substitutes, spinal cord, vision enhancement, and heart valvesOffers expanded coverage of adult and embryonic stem cells of the cardiovascular, hematopoietic, musculoskeletal, nervous, and other organ systemsFull-color presentation throughout"},

However, scientific attention has been quite unevenly distributed throughout the different branches of the tree of life, leaving molluscs, one of the most diverse animal groups, relatively unexplored and without representation within the narrow collection of well established model organisms. Within this Phylum, bivalve molluscs play a fundamental role in the functioning of the marine ecosystem, constitute very valuable commercial resources in aquaculture, and have been widely used as sentinel organisms in the biomonitoring of marine pollution. Yet, it has only been very recently that this complex group of organisms became a preferential subject for omic studies, posing new challenges for their integrative characterization. The present contribution aims to give a detailed insight into the state of the art of the omic studies and functional information analysis of bivalve molluscs, providing a timely perspective on the available data resources and on the current and prospective applications for the biomonitoring of harmful marine compounds.},

This study assessed the natural product anti-biofilm performance of an extract of the seaweed, Chondrus crispus, and two isolated compounds from terrestrial sources, (+)-usnic acid and juglone, against two marine biofilm forming bacteria, Cobetia marina and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus. Bioassays were developed using quantitative imaging and fluorescent labelling to test the natural products over a range of concentrations against initial bacterial attachment. All natural products affected bacterial attachment; however, juglone demonstrated the best anti-biofilm performance against both bacterial species at a concentration range between 5-20 ppm. In addition, for the first time, a dose-dependent inhibition (hormetic) response was observed for natural products against marine biofilm forming bacteria.},

	abstract = {Experts reveal surefire methods for walleye trolling, equipment techniques, tactics, and moreOn big, open water like the Great Lakes, sprawling Western reservoirs, and large North American rivers, trolling puts more walleyes in the boat-hour for hour-than any other fishing method. Why? Because if done correctly, the lure or bait is always in the fish's strike zone. If anglers do it wrong, all they will net is a long, frustrating boat ride. In this detailed instructional guide, generously illustrated with more than 50 color photos and complemented by time-tested fish-catching secrets from 17 professional fishing authorities, fishermen will learn to catch walleyes from those who chase this highly prized sport fish for a living.A veteran walleye angler himself, author Chip Gross covers every aspect of walleye trolling, offering advice on basic and advanced trolling equipment, trolling setups throughout the fishing year, choosing crankbaits and other lures, determining when and where to fish, night trolling for walleyes, purchasing and rigging a boat for walleye trolling, and how to catch that trophy walleye of a lifetime. Information on cleaning and caring for the catch, as well as Gross's favorite walleye recipe, is also included.Walleyes are finicky, will-o'-the-wisp fish, often here today and gone tomorrow. They follow schools of baitfish like hungry wolf packs; as the bait moves, they move. Often this translates to anglers enjoying spectacular fishing one day but getting scarcely a bite, or possibly none at all, the next. Successful trolling can seem like an unattainable goal, but Trolling Big-Water Walleyes makes that goal easier to reach.},

Comparative Biomechanics is the first and only textbook that takes a comprehensive look at the mechanical aspects of life--covering animals and plants, structure and movement, and solids and fluids. An ideal entry point into the ways living creatures interact with their immediate physical world, this revised and updated edition examines how the forms and activities of animals and plants reflect the materials available to nature, considers rules for fluid flow and structural design, and explores how organisms contend with environmental forces.
Drawing on physics and mechanical engineering, Steven Vogel looks at how animals swim and fly, modes of terrestrial locomotion, organism responses to winds and water currents, circulatory and suspension-feeding systems, and the relationship between size and mechanical design. He also investigates links between the properties of biological materials--such as spider silk, jellyfish jelly, and muscle--and their structural and functional roles. Early chapters and appendices introduce relevant physical variables for quantification, and problem sets are provided at the end of each chapter.
Comparative Biomechanics is useful for physical scientists and engineers seeking a guide to state-of-the-art biomechanics. For a wider audience, the textbook establishes the basic biological context for applied areas--including ergonomics, orthopedics, mechanical prosthetics, kinesiology, sports medicine, and biomimetics--and provides materials for exhibit designers at science museums.

We recorded and compared male courtship drum sounds of the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus and the painted goby P. pictus and examined if they can function in species recognition within sympatric populations. We also examined which acoustic features are related to male quality and the factors that affect female courtship in the sand goby, to determine whether vocalisations potentially play a role in mate assessment. Drums produced by the painted goby showed significantly higher dominant frequencies, higher sound pulse repetition rates and longer intervals between sounds than those of the sand goby. In the sand goby, male quality was predicted by visual and acoustic courtship signals. Regression analyses showed that sound amplitude was a good predictor of male length, whereas the duration of nest behaviour and active calling rate (i.e. excluding silent periods) were good predictors of male condition factor and fat reserves respectively. In addition, the level of female courtship was predicted by male nest behaviour. The results suggest that the frequency and temporal patterns of sounds can encode species identity, whereas sound amplitude and calling activity reflects male size and fat reserves. Visual courtship duration (nest-related behaviour) also seems relevant to mate choice, since it reflects male condition and is related to female courtship. Our work suggests that acoustic communication can contribute to mate choice in the sand goby group, and invites further study.},

Fish taken from Grand Lake St. Marys, a eutrophic lake in Ohio, USA, were analyzed for microcystin-LR in their fillets using LC-MS/MS. Of 129 fish tested for microcystins, only black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) tested positive for microcystin-LR. Less than 10\% of Pomoxis and 7\% of Cyprinus samples contained measurable levels of microcystin-LR. Statistical analysis yielded a p-value of 0.07 between Pomoxis and the pooled results of the other four fish species. However, this comparison was complicated by the large difference in sample size between species. Further sampling in Grand Lake St. Marys for microcystin-LR would help determine if microcystin-LR exposure occurs through foodweb transfer.},

Previous studies have shown Atlantic salmon endothelial cells to be the primary targets of ISAV infection. However, it is not known if cells other than endothelial cells play a role in ISAV tropism. To further assess cell tropism, we examined ISAV infection of Atlantic salmon gill epithelial cells in vivo  and in vitro . We demonstrated the susceptibility of epithelial cells to ISAV infection. On comparison of primary gill epithelial cell cultures with ISAV permissive fish cell cultures, we found the virus yield in primary gill epithelial cells to be comparable with that of salmon head kidney (SHK)-1 cells, but lower than TO or Atlantic salmon kidney (ASK)-II cells. Light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the primary gill cells possessed characteristics consistent with epithelial cells. Virus histochemistry showed that gill epithelial cells expressed 4-O -acetylated sialic acid which is recognized as the ISAV receptor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of ISAV infection in Atlantic salmon primary gill epithelial cells. This study thus broadens our understanding of cell tropism and transmission of ISAV in Atlantic salmon.},

The Role of Green Chemistry in Biomass Processing and Conversion features contributions from leading experts from Asia, Europe, and North America. Focusing on lignocellulosic biomass, the most abundant biomass resource, the book begins with a general introduction to biomass and biorefineries and then provides an update on the latest advances in green chemistry that support biomass processing and conversion. Next, the authors describe current and emerging biomass processing and conversion techniques that use green chemistry technologies, including:

Green solvents such as ionic liquids, supercritical CO2, and water
Sustainable energy sources such as microwave irradiation and sonification
Green catalytic technologies

	abstract = {Toxic cyanobacterial blooms have persisted in freshwater systems around the world for centuries and appear to be globally increasing in frequency and severity. Toxins produced by bloom-associated cyanobacteria can have drastic impacts on the ecosystem and surrounding communities, and bloom biomass can disrupt aquatic food webs and act as a driver for hypoxia. Little is currently known regarding the genomic content of the Microcystis strains that form blooms or the companion heterotrophic community associated with bloom events. To address these issues, we examined the bloom-associated microbial communities in single samples from Lake Erie (North America), Lake Tai (Taihu, China), and Grand Lakes St. Marys (OH, USA) using comparative metagenomics. Together the Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria comprised {\textgreater}90\% of each bloom bacterial community sample, although the dominant phylum varied between systems. Relative to the existing Microcystis aeruginosa NIES 843 genome, sequences from Lake Erie and Taihu revealed a number of metagenomic islands that were absent in the environmental samples. Moreover, despite variation in the phylogenetic assignments of bloom-associated organisms, the functional potential of bloom members remained relatively constant between systems. This pattern was particularly noticeable in the genomic contribution of nitrogen assimilation genes. In Taihu, the genetic elements associated with the assimilation and metabolism of nitrogen were predominantly associated with Proteobacteria, while these functions in the North American lakes were primarily contributed to by the Cyanobacteria. Our observations build on an emerging body of metagenomic surveys describing the functional potential of microbial communities as more highly conserved than that of their phylogenetic makeup within natural systems.},

	abstract = {Dr. Narendra Tuteja did his M.Sc., Ph.D and D.Sc. in Biochemistry from the Lucknow University in 1977, 1982 and 2008, respectively. He is fellow of the Academies of Sciences: FNASc. (2003), FNA (2007), FASc. (2009) and FNESA (2009).
Dr. Tuteja has made major contributions in the field of plant DNA replication and abiotic stress signal transduction, especially in isolating novel DNA/RNA helicases and several components of calcium and G-proteins signaling pathways. Initially he made pioneer contributions in isolation and characterization of large number of helicases from human cells while he was at ICGEB Trieste and published several papers in high impact journals including EMBO J. and Nucleic Acids Research. From India he has cloned the first plant helicase (Plant J. 2000) and presented the first direct evidence for a novel role of a pea DNA helicase (PNAS, USA, 2005) in salinity stress tolerance and pea heterotrimeric G-proteins (Plant J. 2007) in salinity and heat stress tolerance. Dr. Tuteja has reported the first direct evidence in plant that PLC functions as an effector for Ga subunit of G-proteins. All the above work has received extensive coverage in many journals, including Nature Biotechnology, and bulletins all over the world. His group has also discovered novel substrate (pea CBL) for pea CIPK (FEBS J. 2006). He has already developed the salinity tolerant tobacco and rice plants without affecting yield. Recently, few new high salinity stress tolerant genes (e.g. Lectin receptor like kinase, Chlorophyll a/b binding protein and Ribosomal L30E) have been isolated from Pisum sativum and have been shown to confer high salinity stress tolerance in bacteria and plant (Glycoconjugate J. 2010; Plant Signal. Behav. 2010). Recently, very high salinity stress tolerant genes from fungus Piriformospora indica have been isolated and their functional validation in fungus and plants is in progress. Overall, Dr. Tuteja's research uncovers three new pathways to plant abiotic stress tolerance. His results are an important success and indicate the potential for improving crop production at sub-optimal conditions.

Dr. Sarvajeet Singh Gill did his B.Sc. (1998) from Kanpur University and M.Sc. (2001, Gold Medalist), M. Phil. (2003) and Ph.D (2009) from Aligarh Muslim University.
Dr. Gill has several research papers, review articles and book chapters to his credit in the journals of national and international repute and in edited books. He has co-edited four books namely Sulfur assimilation and Abiotic Stress in Plants; Eutrophication: causes, consequences and control; Plant Responses to Abiotic Stress, and Abiotic Stress Tolerance published by Springer-Verlag (Germany), IK International, New Delhi, and Bentham Science Publishers, respectively. He was awarded Junior Scientist of the year award by National Environmental Science Academy New Delhi in 2008.
Presently with Dr. Tuteja, Dr. Gill is working on heterotrimeric G proteins and plant DNA helicases to uncover the abiotic stress tolerance mechanism in rice. The transgenic plants overexpressing heterotrimeric G proteins and plant DNA helicases may be important for improving crop production at sub-optimal conditions.

Dr. Renu Tuteja did her B.Sc. (1975) and M.Sc. (1977) from Lucknow University and Ph.D. (1983) from Kanpur University.
Dr. Tuteja has made significant contribution in understanding the role of helicases in the DNA and RNA metabolism in malaria parasite and human. She has reported and characterized a number of novel helicases from malaria parasite and human. Recently she has reported the genome wide analysis of helicases from malaria parasite and their comparison with the human host. This work was published in Cell Cycle. She has shown that eukaryotic initiation factor 4A is a dual helicase, essential for the growth and survival of malaria parasite (Journal of Molecular Biology). Her recent work on an RNA helicase from malaria parasite revealed that it is involved in splicing. This work was published as cover image article in Archives in Biochemistry and Biophysics. Her helicase work has received coverage in journals, including a cover image article in Archives in Biochemistry and Biophysics and News and Views article in Cell Cycle. She has characterized novel signal peptidase from malaria parasite and reported its modulation by phosphorylation. Using bioinformatics approach she has reported the existence of all the components of protein translocation pathway and mRNA transport pathway from malaria parasite. Recently she was awarded the Top Cited Paper Award from FEBS J. for one of her article on Malaria published in 2007. Her work has demonstrated novel functions of eIF4A, Ku autoantigen and nucleolin as DNA helicases. On the basis of her interesting discovery of Ku as a helicase, a double-strand break repair model has been proposed in many text books.
Dr. Tuteja became the first Indian Scientist from India to have published in Nature Genetics (13, 1996) and that also cover image article on helicases. Her recent interests are to understand the basic biology of malaria parasite in order to identify novel drug targets. Her research indicates novel ways to control malaria by inhibiting helicases. Till to date she has published a total of 79 papers in journals of international repute.

Heavily illustrated and full of entertaining and informative facts, City Critters examines how and why so many wild animals choose to live in places that, on first glance at least, seem contrary to their needs. How do those deer, raccoons, squirrels, skunks, coyotes, crows, gulls and geese - not to mention the alligators, eagles, otters and snakes - manage to survive in the big city? What special skills do city critters have that many of their wilderness cousins lack? Why have they developed these skills? And what are our responsibilities in ensuring that these animals can continue to share our city lives?},

	abstract = {This study investigated the in vivo effects of microcystins on gene expression of several phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPP) in the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea with two different exposure scenarios. Clams were exposed for 96 h to 5 µg L-1 of dissolved microcystin-LR and the relative changes of gene expression of three different types of PPP (PPP1, 2 and 4) were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed a significant induction of PPP2 gene expression in the visceral mass. In contrast, the cyanotoxin did not cause any significant changes on PPP1 and PPP4 gene expression. Based on these results, we studied alterations in transcriptional patterns in parallel with enzymatic activity of C. fluminea for PPP2, induced by a Microcystis aeruginosa toxic strain (1 × 105 cells cm-3) during 96 h. The relative changes of gene expression and enzyme activity in visceral mass were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and colorimetric assays respectively. The clams exhibited a significant reduction of PPP2 activity with a concomitant enhancement of gene expression. Considering all the results we can conclude that the exposure to an ecologically relevant concentration of pure or intracellular microcystins (-LR) promoted an in vivo effect on PPP2 gene expression in C. fluminea.},

	abstract = {PRINT FORMAT ONLY NOTE: NO FURTHER DISCOUNT FOR THIS PRINT PRODUCT- OVERSTOCK SALE -- Significantly reduced list price This new book from the NASA History Series tackles an interesting duo of biological problems that will be familiar to anybody who has seen photos of Apollo astronauts quarantined after their return to Earth. Namely, how do we avoid contaminating celestial bodies with Earthly germs when we send spacecraft to study these bodies, and how do we avoid spreading foreign biological matter from space when our robotic and human spacefarers return to Earth? Biological matter from an external system could potentially cause an unchecked epidemic either on Earth or in space so strict precautions are necessary. Each time a space vehicle visits another world it runs the risk of forever changing that extraterrestrial environment. We are surrounded on Earth by a mélange of different microorganisms, and if some of these hitchhike onboard a space mission, they could contaminate and start colonies on a different planet. Such an occurrence would irrevocably alter the nature of that world, compromise all future scientific exploration of the body, and possibly damage any extant life on it. By inadvertently carrying exotic organisms back to Earth on our spacecraft, we also risk the release of biohazardous materials into our own ecosystem. Such concerns were recognized by scientists even before the 1957 launch of Sputnik. This book presents the history of planetary protection by tracing the responses to the above concerns on NASA's missions to the Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, and many smaller bodies of our solar system. The book relates the extensive efforts put forth by NASA to plan operations and prepare space vehicles that return exemplary science without contaminating the biospheres of other worlds or our own. To protect irreplaceable environments, NASA has committed to conducting space exploration in a manner that is protective of the bodies visited, as well as of our own planet.},

	abstract = {The most complete treatment available of virus ecology across kingdoms of host species 
Viruses are the most abundant organisms on the planet, occurring in every conceivable ecosystem. A growing part of the scientific community has come to view viruses as highly evolved biological entities with an organismal biology that is complex and interwoven with the biology of their hosting species. Studies in Viral Ecology, Volume II explains the ecology of viruses by examining their interactive dynamics with their animal hosts, including the types of transmission cycles that viruses have evolved encompassing principal and alternate hosts, vehicles, and vectoring species. Examining virology from an organismal biology approach, it focuses on the concept that viral infections represent areas of overlap in the ecologies of the involved species.
Compiled by field expert Christon Hurst and featuring internationally recognized contributors, this volume begins with background information designed to bring readers to a common base of comprehension, defining viral ecology and the basic biology of viruses. Then, viruses with animal hosting species are discussed, including:


Coral viruses

Viruses infecting marine molluscs

The viral ecology of aquatic crustaceans

Viruses of fish

Ecology of viruses infecting ectothermic vertebrates--the impact of ranavirus infections on amphibians

Viruses of insects

Viruses of terrestrial mammals

Viruses of cetaceans

The relationship between humans, their viruses, and prions

Ecology of avian viruses
This volume also helps readers understand how information gained from molecular techniques is used to comprehend these various aspects of virology. Additionally, this set of books contains information on the ecology of viroids and prions, which are molecularly related to and share common ecological aspects with the viruses.
Studies in Viral Ecology, Volume II is essential for advanced undergraduate and graduate-level students studying viral ecology and environmental genomics. It also serves as an authoritative reference for professionals in the fields of virology, microbial ecology, infectious diseases, and disease transmission relative to humans, animals, and plants; this includes virologists, microbiologists, physicians, veterinarians, and agriculturalists.

--Reviews in Fish Biology \& Fisheries
The study of animal cognition has until recently been largely confined to birds and mammals; a historical bias which has led to the belief that learning plays little or no part in the development of behavior in fishes and reptiles. Research in recent decades has begun to redress this misconception and it is now recognized that fishes exhibit a rich array of sophisticated behavior with impressive learning capabilities entirely comparable with those of mammals and other terrestrial animals.
Building on the very well-received First Edition, and covering all major areas of fish learning, all chapters in this brand new edition of
Fish Cognition and Behavior have been revised and updated by an internationally recognized team of contributing authors, with the addition of three brand new chapters, covering personality traits and behavior, lateralization of cognitive functions in fish, and cognition and welfare.
This Second Edition of
Fish Cognition and Behavior is essential reading for all fish biologists and ethologists, and contains much information of commercial importance for fisheries managers and aquaculture personnel. Libraries in all universities and research establishments where biological sciences, aquaculture and fisheries are studied and taught will find this book an extremely important addition to their shelves.

	abstract = {This study describes the accumulation of Hg and metallothionein gene expression in Litopenaeus vannamei Boone, 1931 with aquafeeds as the major source of Hg. Trials were conducted under controlled conditions in experimental tank facilities with high (indoor tanks) and low (outdoor tanks) Hg aquafeeds concentrations. Aquafeeds were the sole source of Hg for the shrimps and concentrations varied from 5.4 to 124 ng.g-1 d.w.. In the three animal fractions analysed; muscle (6,3 - 15,9 ng.g-1); hepatopancreas (5,1 - 22,0 ng.g-1) and exoskeleton (3,0 - 16,2 ng.g-1), Hg concentrations were significantly lower in the outdoor trials submitted to Hg-poor aquafeeds. Maximum shrimp muscle Hg concentrations were low (36.4 ng.g-1 w.w.) relative to maximum permissible concentrations for human consumption and Hg content in muscle and hepatopancreas were significantly correlated with Hg content in aquafeeds. Highest Hg concentrations in the exoskeleton of animals exposed to Hg-richer aquafeed, suggested that a detoxification mechanism is taking place. On the other hand the metallothionein suffered no variation in its relative expression in any of the experiments, meaning that the contact with feed containing the observed Hg concentrations were not sufficient to activate gene transcription. It was not possible, under the experimental design used, to infer Hg effects on the biological performance of the animals.},

	abstract = {Background  
Attachment strength of fouling organisms on silicone coatings is low. We hypothesized that low attachment strength on silicones is, in part, due to the interaction of surface available components with natural glues. Components could alter curing of glues through bulk changes or specifically through altered enzyme activity.
Methodology/Principal Findings
GC-MS analysis of silicone coatings showed surface-available siloxanes when the coatings were gently rubbed with a cotton swab for 15 seconds or given a 30 second rinse with methanol. Mixtures of compounds were found on 2 commercial and 8 model silicone coatings. The hypothesis that silicone components alter glue curing enzymes was tested with curing barnacle glue and with commercial enzymes. In our model, barnacle glue curing involves trypsin-like serine protease(s), which activate enzymes and structural proteins, and a transglutaminase which cross-links glue proteins. Transglutaminase activity was significantly altered upon exposure of curing glue from individual barnacles to silicone eluates. Activity of purified trypsin and, to a greater extent, transglutaminase was significantly altered by relevant concentrations of silicone polymer constituents.
Conclusions/Significance
Surface-associated silicone compounds can disrupt glue curing and alter enzyme properties. Altered curing of natural glues has potential in fouling management.},

	abstract = {Watersheds are a widely accepted scale for water governance activities. This paper makes three contributions to current understandings of watersheds as governance units. First, the paper collects recent research identifying some of the challenges associated with the policy framework understood as the watershed approach. These challenges are boundary choice, accountability, public participation, and watersheds' asymmetries with 'problem-sheds' and 'policy-sheds'. Second, the paper draws upon this synthesis and on a review of the development and evolution of the concept of watersheds to suggest that the challenges associated with the watershed approach are symptoms of a broader issue: that the concept of watersheds was developed as a technical tool but has been taken up as a policy framework. The result of this transition from tool to framework, the paper argues, has been the conflation of governance tools, hydrologic boundaries, and Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). Third, the paper calls for an analysis of watersheds as separate from the governance tools with which they have been conflated, and presents three entry points into such an analysis.},

	abstract = {Biological Diversity provides an up-to-date, authoritative review of the methods of measuring and assessing biological diversity, together with their application. The book's emphasis is on quantifying the variety, abundance, and occurrence of taxa, and on providing objective and clear guidance for both scientists and managers. This is a fast-moving field and one that is the focus of intense research interest. However the rapid development of new methods, the inconsistent and sometimes confusing application of old ones, and the lack of consensus in the literature about the best approach, means that there is a real need for a current synthesis. Biological Diversity covers fundamental measurement issues such as sampling, re-examines familiar diversity metrics (including species richness, diversity statistics, and estimates of spatial and temporal turnover), discusses species abundance distributions and how best to fit them, explores species occurrence and the spatial structure of biodiversity, and investigates alternative approaches used to assess trait, phylogenetic, and genetic diversity. The final section of the book turns to a selection of contemporary challenges such as measuring microbial diversity, evaluating the impact of disturbance, assessing biodiversity in managed landscapes, measuring diversity in the imperfect fossil record, and using species density estimates in management and conservation.},

There is also an increasing concern for the conservation, adaptive management, and restoration of the unique natural ecosystems and cultural landscapes that characterize this area. The region's biological and cultural heritage as well as its huge wealth of biodiversity is now at real risk. This brings a further urgency to the task of communicating detailed butreadily accessible information on the Mediterranean biota, and an ecological, historical and evolutionary perspective to the changing contexts in which the region's flora and fauna continue to evolve. There is no other recent textbook devoted solely to Mediterranean evolutionary ecology, and a synthesis of the many recent advances is now overdue. This new work builds on the success and reputation of the first edition, although the text has been updated and expanded to document recent changes to biodiversity, new ecological and evolutionary insights, and the challenges for the future. These changes include the addition of two new chapters devoted to the Mediterranean Sea itself, andespecially the coastal areas. Throughout the book, the pressing issues of global change (especially climate warming) are addressed, in conjunction with changing land use, and in terms of their potential impact on biota, communities, ecosystems, and landscapes.},

	abstract = {Marine organisms represent an important source of novel bioactive compounds, often showing unique modes of action. Such drugs may be useful tools to study complex processes such as reproduction; which is characterized by many crucial steps that start at gamete maturation and activation and virtually end at the first developmental stages. During these processes cytoskeletal elements such as microfilaments and microtubules play a key-role. In this review we describe: (i) the involvement of such structures in both cellular and in vitro processes; (ii) the toxins that target the cytoskeletal elements and dynamics; (iii) the main steps of reproduction and the marine drugs that interfere with these cytoskeleton-mediated processes. We show that marine drugs, acting on microfilaments and microtubules, exert a wide range of impacts on reproductive events including sperm maturation and motility, oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryo development.},

	abstract = {Microcystins (MC) are potent hepatotoxins produced by the cyanobacteria of the genera Planktothrix, Microcystis, Aphanizomenon, Nostoc and Anabaena. These cyclic heptapeptides have strong affinity to serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PPs) thereby acting as an inhibitor of this group of enzymes. Through this interaction a cascade of events responsible for the MC cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in animal cells may take place. Moreover MC induces oxidative stress in animal cells and together with the inhibition of PPs, this pathway is considered to be one of the main mechanisms of MC toxicity. In recent years new insights on the key enzymes involved in the signal-transduction and toxicity have been reported demonstrating the complexity of the interaction of these toxins with animal cells. Key proteins involved in MC up-take, biotransformation and excretion have been identified, demonstrating the ability of aquatic animals to metabolize and excrete the toxin. MC have shown to interact with the mitochondria. The consequences are the dysfunction of the organelle, induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell apoptosis. MC activity leads to the differential expression/activity of transcriptional factors and protein kinases involved in the pathways of cellular differentiation, proliferation and tumor promotion activity. This activity may result from the direct inhibition of the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. This review aims to summarize the increasing data regarding the molecular mechanisms of MC toxicity in animal systems, reporting for direct MC interacting proteins and key enzymes in the process of toxicity biotransformation/excretion of these cyclic peptides.},

	abstract = {Analysis of climate change policy innovations across North America at transnational, federal, state, and local levels, involving public, private, and civic actors. 
North American policy responses to global climate change are complex and sometimes contradictory and reach across multiple levels of government. For example, the U.S. federal government rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) restrictions, but California developed some of the world's most comprehensive climate change law and regulation; Canada's federal government ratified the Kyoto Protocol, but Canadian GHG emissions increased even faster than those of the United States; and Mexico's state-owned oil company addressed climate change issues in the 1990s, in stark contrast to leading U.S. and Canadian energy firms. This book is the first to examine and compare political action for climate change across North America, at levels ranging from continental to municipal, in locations ranging from Mexico to Toronto to Portland, Maine.
Changing Climates in North American Politics investigates new or emerging institutions, policies, and practices in North American climate governance; the roles played by public, private, and civil society actors; the diffusion of policy across different jurisdictions; and the effectiveness of multilevel North American climate change governance. It finds that although national climate policies vary widely, the complexities and divergences are even greater at the subnational level. Policy initiatives are developed separately in states, provinces, cities, large corporations, NAFTA bodies, universities, NGOs, and private firms, and this lack of coordination limits the effectiveness of multilevel climate change governance. In North America, unlike much of Europe, climate change governance has been largely bottom-up rather than top-down.

	abstract = {This volume explores the climates, landscapes, ecosystems and hazards that comprise the Mediterranean world. It traces the development of the Mediterranean landscape over very long timescales and examines modern processes and key environmental issues in a wide range of settings. The Mediterranean is the only region on Earth where three continents meet and this interaction has produced a very distinctive Physical Geography. This book examines the landscapes and processes at themargins of these continents and the distinctive marine environment between them. Catastrophic earthquakes, explosive volcanic eruptions and devastating storms and floods are intimately bound up within the history and mythology of the Mediterranean world. This is a key region for the study of naturalhazards because it offers unrivalled access to long records of hazard occurrence and impact through documentary, archaeological and geological archives. The Mediterranean is also a biodiversity hotspot; it has been a meeting place for plants, animals and humans from three continents throughout much of its history. The Quaternary records of these interactions are more varied and better preserved than in any other part of the world. These records have provided important new insights into thetempo of climate, landscape and ecosystem change in the Mediterranean region and beyond. The region is unique because of the very early and widespread impact of humans in landscape and ecosystem change - and the richness of the archaeological and geological archives that chronicle this impact. This bookexamines this history and these interactions and places current environmental issues in long term context.

The trade and consumption of bivalve shellfish is a global industry and is increasing. Human illness caused by infectious agents transmitted through animal or human sources through shellfish consumption has been recognized for many years. It addresses contaminant sources and means of transmission to bivalve shellfish and where possible, identifies options to interrupt the cycle. The efficacy of current practices is discussed with the aid of case studies written by practitioners working in the field from a number of developed and developing countries. The need for the deployment of new approaches to protect human health from infectious diseases associated with the consumption of contaminated bivalve shellfish is discussed, focusing specifically on water management aspects and strategies. It provides valuable information on the real health risks posed by shellfish consumption. It distills worldwide experience; identifies the challenges and opportunities that face the industry and suggests responses to those challenges. It provides the scientific basis for regulation and associated monitoring and risk reduction programmes to enable health agencies, water quality and shellfish regulatory agencies and other stakeholders worldwide to control and reduce the existing and potential future infectious disease problems through better management of shellfish waters."--Publisher's description.},

	abstract = {The Western approach to nature has always operated under both spiritual and scientific views. While Christianity decrees that human beings have dominion over nature, evolutionary biology teaches us that we are but highly adapted animals among a biological network of millions of other species. What is our proper relationship to wild animalsand what is our responsibility to them? In The Bullhead Queen, Sue Leaf exemplifies the moral aspect of humans to nature through a collection of engaging meditations on the places she sees every day on Pioneer Lake in east-central Minnesota. Reflecting on the birds she peers at through binoculars and the Lutheran church that anchors the lakes southern shore, Leaf contemplates how her relationship to nature has been colored by the Christian theology of her childhood. Acknowledging the influence of the church on her view of the natural world, she follows the liturgical calendar as a thread, chronicling the change of seasons over the year.Leaf considers the results of the assumption that nature is ours to use: we continue to fish, trap, and hunt animals whose populations are ghosts of their former selves and produce mounting environmental pressures on their habitats. Observing the ways in which the heavy hand of human beings has changed the landscape of Pioneer Lake, and many others like it, she also rejoices in the ways in which the lakes remain wild and exuberant, influencing the lives of all who encounter them.},

	abstract = {A wide-ranging, interdisciplinary look at global changes that may occur over the next fifty years--whether sudden and cataclysmic world-changing events or gradually unfolding trends. 
Fundamental change occurs most often in one of two ways: as a "fatal discontinuity," a sudden catastrophic event that is potentially world changing, or as a persistent, gradual trend. Global catastrophes include volcanic eruptions, viral pandemics, wars, and large-scale terrorist attacks; trends are demographic, environmental, economic, and political shifts that unfold over time. In this provocative book, scientist Vaclav Smil takes a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary look at the catastrophes and trends the next fifty years may bring.
Smil first looks at rare but cataclysmic events, both natural and human-produced, then at trends of global importance, including the transition from fossil fuels to other energy sources and growing economic and social inequality. He also considers environmental change--in some ways an amalgam of sudden discontinuities and gradual change--and assesses the often misunderstood complexities of global warming.

Global Catastrophes and Trends does not come down on the side of either doom-and-gloom scenarios or techno-euphoria. Instead, Smil argues that understanding change will help us reverse negative trends and minimize the risk of catastrophe.},

	abstract = {Despite its usually sunny skies and its innocent aquamarine hue, Lake Erie does have something noir about it. Of all the Great Lakes, it's had the most shipwrecks, due to its wickedly shifting sandbars. Also, the western end of Lake Erie is the thunderstorm capital of Canada - the lightning displays are breathtaking, the winds can hit gale force, and, due to the lake's shallowness, the waves build very quickly. But despite these boating hazards, a great deal of alcohol crossed Erie during Prohibition. Mobster corpses were frequently dumped into the Detroit River, to wash up on the beaches of Pelee Island, where a special ice house was built to accommodate them.                 Phragmites, that tall reed with the graceful plumes that gives nothing back to native ecosystems, has started to clog up important Pelee Island wetlands. The Carolinian woodlands on Pelee are being threatened by the same killer garlic mustard invasion that's menacing the rest of Ontario's hardwood stands, choking out the native plants and killing trees by poisoning their root systems. All of these pests have reached menacing proportions in only the last 25 years - about the time we've been on Pelee Island. It's not just change that's so disturbing, it's the rapidity with which negative change is now taking place.                 Human beings will keep on saying, "It's not too late" until the very last gasp. It's our nature Hope's built in. And hope's not always unjustified Environments can be repaired; water can be cleansed; and species populations can recover, unless, of course, the species goes extinct first. So, ever hopeful, we'll beaver away at garlic mustard elimination and habitat preservation and so forth, and continue to push for change, while remaining fully aware that of all charitable giving, 97 per cent goes to human causes, and of the remaining 3 per cent, 11/2 per cent goes to pet animals. That leaves only 11/2 per cent for the non-human part of the planet that supports all life, including us.},

	abstract = {More and more data indicate that evolution has resulted in lineages consisting of mosaics of genes derived from different ancestors. It is therefore becoming increasingly clear that the tree is an inadequate metaphor of evolutionary change. In this book, Arnold promotes the 'web-of-life' metaphor as a more appropriate representation of evolutionary change in all lifeforms. -;Even before the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species, the perception of evolutionary change has been a tree-like pattern of diversification - with divergent branches spreading further and further from the trunk. In the only illustration of Darwin's treatise, branches large and small never reconnect. However, it is now evident that this view does not adequately encompass the richness of evolutionary pattern and process. Instead, the evolution of species from microbes to. mammals builds like a web that crosses and re-crosses through genetic exchange, even as it grows outward from a point of origin. Some of the avenues for genetic exchange, for example introgression through sexual recombination versus lateral gene transfer mediated by transposable elements, are based on. definably different molecular mechanisms. However, even such widely different genetic processes may result in similar effects on adaptations (either new or transferred), genome evolution, population genetics, and the evolutionary/ecological trajectory of organisms. For example, the evolution of novel adaptations (resulting from lateral gene transfer) leading to the flea-borne, deadly, causative agent of plague from a rarely-fatal, orally-transmitted, bacterial species is quite similar to the. adaptations accrued from natural hybridization between annual sunflower species resulting in the formation of several new species. Thus, more and more data indicate that evolution has resulted in lineages consisting of mosaics of genes derived from different ancestors. It is therefore becoming. increasingly clear that the tree is an inadequate metaphor of evolutionary change. In this book, Arnold promotes the 'web-of-life' metaphor as a more appropriate representation of evolutionary change in all lifeforms. This research level text is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate level students taking related courses in departments of genetics, ecology and evolution. It will also be of relevance and use to professional evolutionary biologists and systematists seeking a comprehensive and authoritative overview of this rapidly expanding field. -;Evolution Through Genetic Exchange represents a compelling argument for a paradigm shift in evolutionary biology, in which the Tree of Life is replaced conceptually by a Web of Life that connects all living organisms and their genomes.

"You save money on infrastructure, you save on energy use from pumping and treating water."                 "We have this tendency to just turn on our taps and think, 'Well, there's an endless supply there,'" said [Tim Morris] of the Sierra Club. "But it's coming from somewhere and it's having an impact. Our water resources are not infinite and they do have a point where they're going to end up in trouble unless we do a better job of stewarding them."},

	abstract = {The Middle Holocene epoch (8,000 to 3,000 years ago) was a time of dramatic changes in the physical world and in human cultures. Across this span, climatic conditions changed rapidly, with cooling in the high to mid-latitudes and drying in the tropics. In many parts of the world, human groups became more complex, with early horticultural systems replaced by intensive agriculture and small-scale societies being replaced by larger, more hierarchial organizations. 
Climate Change and Cultural Dynamics explores the cause and effect relationship between climatic change and cultural transformations across the mid-Holocene (c. 4000 B.C.).

Explores the role of climatic change on the development of society around the world

With this view in mind, the book includes chapters on oocyte development (oogenesis), hormonal regulation and hormone receptors, formation of the egg envelopes, growth, accumulation of nutrients and maternal transcripts, maturation, hydration, ovulation and fertilization. A special emphasis is placed on using state-of-the-art tools including electron microscopy for discerning the ultra-structure of the follicle and genomic/proteomic tools to fully understand biological basis of fish reproduction. Studies on promoting oocyte maturation, ovulation and spawning in farmed fish and preservation of fish oocytes at low temperatures are also included. 
The book will appeal to University lecturers, students, research scientists and those associated with culture of fish in freshwater or marine aquaculture.Discusses oocyte development, maturation, hydration and fertilization},

The second edition contains new ecological examples, an expanded array of conceptual diagrams and illustrations, new text boxes summarizing important points or defining key terms, and new reference to philosophical issues and controversies. Although the first edition was recognized for its clarity, this revision takes the opportunity to make the exposition of complex topics still clearer to readers without a philosophical background. Readers will gain an understanding of the goals of science, the structure of theory, the kinds of theory relevant to ecology, the way that theory changes, what constitutes objectivity in contemporary science, and the role of paradigms and frameworks for synthesis within ecology and in integration with other disciplines. Finally, how theory can inform and anchor the public use of ecological knowledge in civic debates is laid out. This new edition refines the understanding of how the structure and change of theory can improve the growth and application of one of the 21st centuryOCOs key sciences.

	abstract = {As environmental problems become increasingly complex, it is critical that students and activists learn the skills with which to address them. Although there already are many case studies of actual issues, only in the last few years have environmental scientists paid close attention to their resolution. Environmental Problem Solving teaches these skills. 

Jeffrey W. Hughes creates an organized method for approaching problems, understanding larger issues, and crafting solutions to a wide range of contemporary environmental issues. Many environmental activists often have preconceived ideas of environmental protection and problem solving. They react emotionally to news of deforestation, a new housing development, or a planned big-box store without thinking about the problem logically, and they may automatically regard foresters, development companies, and corporations as opponents. As their views harden, discourse turns acrimonious, and it becomes ever more difficult to find satisfactory solutions.

This book teaches those on both sides of the table to address their own preconceptions and approach hard issues critically, methodically, and fairly. Hughes combines aspects of the decision-making process from the fields of business, management, and communication science based on extensive research and ample practical experience in the field and classroom. He creates a logical framework to help guide thinking from identifying a problem to finding its solution. Using examples drawn from real-life situations, Environmental Problem Solving will become an invaluable guide for environmentalists, agency professionals, consultants, students, naturalists, and concerned citizens.},

	abstract = {The spectacle of archaeology stirs the public interest like few other topics. Sowing the "detective story", finding the missing pieces of the puzzle, understanding an instilled sense of identity, making connections to the material culture, following the global discourse on heritage protection and conservation (i.e. the Elgin Marbles) - are all part of the nexus of cultural values that define the meaning of archaeology to individuals and to the public at large. 
Along with the debates archaeological sites are also often in view of the public - on land, as well as, underwater. Maritime cultural resources encompass sites that, because of their (often) proximity to urban or traveled areas (harbors, rivers, ports) are easily damaged but not easily visible. This leads to special challenges to site management regarding conservation, protection, and enforcement of legal mandates for public education outreach and interpretation.
The editors have brought together state of the art ideas, research and scholarship associated with maritime public education and interpretation. With few publications currently available that feature the public interpretation of maritime and submerged cultural resources, this edited volume will add to a limited body of knowledge in a field that is steadily growing.
Many archaeologists - both academic and professional - work with sites that are open or in view of the public
While there are several books in the field of preservation and heritage protection for terrestrial archaeology, there are very few resources for archaeologists working with maritime and submerged cultural heritage

	abstract = {Natural selection is commonly interpreted as the fundamental mechanism of evolution. Questions about how selection theory can claim to be the all-sufficient explanation of evolution often go unanswered by today's neo-Darwinists, perhaps for fear that any criticism of the evolutionary paradigm will encourage creationists and proponents of intelligent design.In Biological Emergences, Robert Reid argues that natural selection is not the cause of evolution. He writes that the causes of variations, which he refers to as natural experiments, are independent of natural selection; indeed, he suggests, natural selection may get in the way of evolution. Reid proposes an alternative theory to explain how emergent novelties are generated and under what conditions they can overcome the resistance of natural selection. He suggests that what causes innovative variation causes evolution, and that these phenomena are environmental as well as organismal.After an extended critique of selectionism, Reid constructs an emergence theory of evolution, first examining the evidence in three causal arenas of emergent evolution: symbiosis/association, evolutionary physiology/behavior, and developmental evolution. Based on this evidence of causation, he proposes some working hypotheses, examining mechanisms and processes common to all three arenas, and arrives at a theoretical framework that accounts for generative mechanisms and emergent qualities. Without selectionism, Reid argues, evolutionary innovation can more easily be integrated into a general thesis. Finally, Reid proposes a biological synthesis of rapid emergent evolutionary phases and the prolonged, dynamically stable, non-evolutionary phases imposed by natural selection.},

	abstract = {In the quest to conserve global biological resources there has been a growing recognition that conventional scientific methods and institutional arrangements are not always effective in dealing with the biophysical complexities and sociopolitical dimensions of biodiversity issues. Meeting these challenges requires an integrated approach that combines scientific methods with societal values. Community-based research promotes social change, by building the capacity of communities to find collective and culturally appropriate ways to achieve sustainable development on their own terms. Ecosystem management recognizes the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems and attempts to link science, policy and societal goals through interdisciplinary research and multistakeholder decision-making. In 1998, the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, Canada, in partnership with government agencies, educational institutions and community groups began a three-year multidisciplinary study of the ecosystem health of the Rideau River in eastern Ontario, Canada. This paper presents the Rideau River Biodiversity Project as a case study in the application of an integrated approach to assess the biodiversity of an aquatic ecosystem. Ultimately, we present a framework for an integrated approach to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity that combines the strengths of community-based research and ecosystem management through a process of social learning and transdisciplinary inquiry.},

That challenge is met by this work, which resolves a number of crucial questions concerning the scope of this principle of international environmental law; the conditions triggering a right or duty to take precautionary action; the measures to be taken; the allocation of the burden of proof; and the role of socio-economic factors. These questions are dealt with one at a time through the charting and analysis of patterns and common denominators in the extensive (inter)national practice of states regarding the precautionary principle. The hard legal core of the principle is thus gradually exposed. In the process, a realistic and accessible account is given of how and to what extent this general principle can and does direct the actions of states in concrete instances. Ultimately, this work sets out what it takes to act in conformity with the precautionary principle under general international law, and will be of interest to anyone involved with international law and environmental protection.},

In Minnesota, we found that the current aggregate percentage of Amphipoda (an important food item) in lesser scaup diets was 94\% lower than that reported from the same locations in the 1980s. Current mean individual prey mass of Amphipoda and Bivalvia in Minnesota were 86.6\% and 85.1\% lower than historical levels, respectively. In Manitoba, current aggregate percentages of Trichoptera and Chaoboridae in lesser scaup diets (1\% and 0\%, respectively) were lower than those reported from the same location in the 1970s (14\% and 2\%, respectively), whereas the percentage of Chironomidae (40\%) was higher than that of historical levels (19\%). Current mean individual prey mass of all insects, seeds, Chironomidae, and Zygoptera in Manitoba were 63.5\%, 65.4\%, 44.1\%, and 44.9\% lower than those of historical levels, respectively. The observed dietary shift from Amphipoda to less nutritious prey in Minnesota, coupled with lower mean individual prey mass in both locations, likely constitutes lower forage quality in lesser scaup diets, which is consistent with the spring condition hypothesis.

In a recent paper co-authored by Scott Petrie of Bird Studies Canada in Port Rowan, Ont., an expert on the mute swan, he warns because of similar climate to its native Eurasian territory, and increasingly warmer winters, the existing swan population of roughly 2,000 across the Great Lakes could grow to 30,000 within 30 years.

	abstract = {Most engineering systems are subject to a wide range of possible uncertain future conditions. The probabilistic reliability analysis usually fails to address the problems of human error, subjectivity, and lack of system performance history and records. This paper explores the utility of the following fuzzy performance measures for evaluating the performance of a complex water supply system: (i) combined reliability-vulnerability, (ii) robustness, and (iii) resiliency. The regional water supply system for the City of London, Ontario, Canada, is used as the case study. The computational requirements for the implementation of the fuzzy performance measures and their sensitivity to different shapes of fuzzy membership functions are investigated. The study illustrates the capability of the fuzzy performance measures to handle uncertainty and identify critical system components. This can be of value in identifying the optimal level of improvement that will increase the overall system performance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {In evolution, most genes survive and spread within populations because they increase the ability of their hosts (or their close relatives) to survive and reproduce. But some genes spread in spite of being harmful to the host organism--by distorting their own transmission to the next generation, or by changing how the host behaves toward relatives. As a consequence, different genes in a single organism can have diametrically opposed interests and adaptations. Covering all species from yeast to humans, Genes in Conflict is the first book to tell the story of selfish genetic elements, those continually appearing stretches of DNA that act narrowly to advance their own replication at the expense of the larger organism. As Austin Burt and Robert Trivers show, these selfish genes are a universal feature of life with pervasive effects, including numerous counter-adaptations. Their spread has created a whole world of socio-genetic interactions within individuals, usually completely hidden from sight. Genes in Conflict introduces the subject of selfish genetic elements in all its aspects, from molecular and genetic to behavioral and evolutionary. Burt and Trivers give us access for the first time to a crucial area of research--now developing at an explosive rate--that is cohering as a unitary whole, with its own logic and interconnected questions, a subject certain to be of enduring importance to our understanding of genetics and evolution.},

In the case of the Tasmanian rivers, the estuary of the Huon, a largely untouched river, is contrasted with that of the Derwent, a river heavily influenced by industry. The future state of all of these estuaries may be a sensitive indicator of shifts in global weather patterns.},

	abstract = {As recently as 11,000 years ago--"near time" to geologists--mammoths, mastodons, gomphotheres, ground sloths, giant armadillos, native camels and horses, the dire wolf, and many other large mammals roamed North America. In what has become one of science's greatest riddles, these large animals vanished in North and South America around the time humans arrived at the end of the last great ice age. Part paleontological adventure and part memoir, 
Twilight of the Mammoths presents in detail internationally renowned paleoecologist Paul Martin's widely discussed and debated "overkill" hypothesis to explain these mysterious megafauna extinctions. Taking us from Rampart Cave in the Grand Canyon, where he finds himself "chest deep in sloth dung," to other important fossil sites in Arizona and Chile, Martin's engaging book, written for a wide audience, uncovers our rich evolutionary legacy and shows why he has come to believe that the earliest Americans literally hunted these animals to death.

As he discusses the discoveries that brought him to this hypothesis, Martin relates many colorful stories and gives a rich overview of the field of paleontology as well as his own fascinating career. He explores the ramifications of the overkill hypothesis for similar extinctions worldwide and examines other explanations for the extinctions, including climate change. Martin's visionary thinking about our missing megafauna offers inspiration and a challenge for today's conservation efforts as he speculates on what we might do to remedy this situation--both in our thinking about what is "natural" and in the natural world itself.},

	abstract = {Although significant steps have been taken over the last 15 years to reduce the size and frequency of oil spills, the sheer volume of petroleum consumed in the United States and the complex production and distribution network required to meet the demand make spills of oil and other petroleum products inevitable. Approximately 3 million gallons of oil or refined petroleum products are spilled into U.S. waters every year. Oil dispersants (chemical agents such as surfactants, solvents, and other compounds) are used to reduce the effect of oil spills by changing the chemical and physical properties of the oil. By enhancing the amount of oil that physically mixes into the water, dispersants can reduce the potential that a surface slick will contaminate shoreline habitats. Although called for in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 as a tool for minimizing the impact of oil spills, the use of chemical dispersants has long been controversial. This report reviews the adequacy of existing information and ongoing research regarding the effectiveness of dispersants as an oil spill response technique, as well as the effect of dispersed oil on marine and coastal ecosystems. It includes recommended steps to be taken to better support policymakers faced with making hard choices regarding the use of dispersants as part of spill contingency planning efforts or during actual spills.

Christian Blaise, D.Sc., is a senior research scientist at the Saint-Lawrence Centre, Environment Canada, Québec Region, where he heads the Aquatic Toxicology Unit (ATU), River Ecosystems Research Section. He also holds an adjunct professor status at UQAR (Université du Québec à Rimouski) where he contributes to teaching and (co)directs graduate students in the field of ecotoxicology. ATU strives to develop, validate, standardize, modernize (and promote the commercialization of) bioanalytical and biomarker techniques, making use of new instrumental technologies whenever possible, in order to determine the potential (geno)toxicity of chemicals and various types of environmental matrices (e.g., effluents, sediments, pore/surface waters). ATU research output provides practical tools and approaches which facilitate decision-making for environmental management of aquatic ecosystems such as the Saint-Lawrence River. ATU also provides (inter)national technology transfer to interested professionals and agencies and promotes graduate student training by co-directing applied research projects with university collaborators.
Dr. Blaise obtained university diplomas from the U. of Montréal (B.A., 1967: biology and chemistry), U. of Ottawa (B.Sc., 1970: cell biology; M.Sc., 1973: environmental microbiology) and U. of Metz (D.Sc., 1984: ecotoxicology). He is a member of the editorial board for two scientific journals (Environmental Toxicology; Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety) and holds membership in both the biologists'' (Association des Biologistes du Québec) and microbiologists'' (Association des Microbiologistes du Québec) associations of the province of Québec. He regularly attends and makes presentations during major venues held in the field of ecotoxicology (SETAC: Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry; SECOTOX: Society of Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety; ATW-Canada: Aquatic Toxicity Workshop-Canada;ISTA: International Symposium on Toxicity Assessment). Dr. Blaise has (co)authored over 100 scientific articles in internationally refereed journals, as well as having written several book chapters, reviews, and various government technical reports.
He recently co-edited, with Canadian colleagues, a book dedicated to small-scale toxicity testing (Wells, P., K. Lee and C. Blaise (eds.), 1998. Microscale testing in Aquatic Toxicology Advances, Techniques and Practice. CRC Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, Florida, 679 pages). He was scientific organizer of the 10th International Symposium on Toxicity Assessment (ISTA 10), hosted by the Saint-Lawrence Centre where he works, and held in Quebec City, August 26-31, 2001. He further co-edited with another Canadian colleague, a special edition of Environ. Toxicol. (Volume 17 [3]: 2002, special issue) highlighting selected papers presented at the ISTA 10 venue.
Jean-François Férard, D.Sc., is a professor at the University of Metz (Lorraine province of France), where he heads a research team (RT) which is part of a C.N.R.S. (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) research unit for Ecotoxicity and Environmental Health (E.S.E). He also manages an undergraduate school program dedicated to Environmental Engineering. His teaching duties involve fundamental and applied Ecotoxicology, Physiology and Physiotoxicology, Cell Biology and other related disciplines.
In the field of ecotoxicology, his RT was involved in the behavior of metals, PAHs and complex mixtures in air, water and soil compartments and their effects on different organisms (bacteria, algae, crustaceans, plants, arthropods, etc.). His actual research endeavors are more specifically focused on the development of metal-resistance (e.g. phytochelatin) and genotoxic (e.g. comet assay) biomarkers. He also promotes knowledge and use of toxicity tests by organizing an annual course entitled "Ecotoxicity andcarcinogenicity of chemicals" which provides a theoretical and practical view of numerous toxicity tests to decision-makers, industrialists and consultants. Since 1974, he has markedly contributed to numerous research programs that have successfully lead to i) development and validation of different ecotoxicity tools (e.g. new toxicity test methods, trophic chain models, biomarkers), ii) hazard/risk assessment schemes and iii) links between field and laboratory studies. These undertakings were financially supported by the European Economic Community, the French ministry of the Environment, and agencies such as the French Water Agency of the Rhin-Meuse Watershed, the French Agency for Environment and Energy Ressources.
Professor Férard obtained university diplomas from the U. of Strasbourg (B.A., 1970: biology and chemistry; B.Sc., 1973: biochemistry) and U. of Metz (M.Sc., 1974: chemistry and environmental toxicology; D.Sc., 1978: environmental toxicology; State doctorate, 1986: environmental toxicology). He was European editor for Environmental Toxicology and Water Quality from 1992-1996 and holds membership in SETAC (Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry). He regularly makes presentations during major symposia held in the field of ecotoxicology (e.g. SETAC meetings, Secotox conferences, International Symposia on Toxicity Assessment, Annual Aquatic Toxicity Workshops in Canada). Professor Férard has (co)authored over 50 scientific articles in (inter)nationally refereed journals, as well as having written several book chapters, reviews, and research reports. He also participates in several OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and AFNOR (Association française de normalisation - French standards association) initiatives to standardize and promote the use of biological tests.},

During the last decade the state of the environment regarding priority hazardous substances has continuously improved. According to monitoring results, the concentration of hazardous substances in sediments and in surface water remains low in the majority of Estonian rivers, and their quality by European standards is classified as good. Concentrations of hazardous substances found in Baltic fish in the Estonian coastal sea remain below standards established by the FAO/WHO for food. The key to the improvement of monitoring is the integration of source-oriented and load-oriented approaches, since both are lacking full-scale consistent data coverage.},

Developmental psychologists, for their part, have been wary of the perceived genetic determinism of evolutionary thinking. This important volume brings together an array of prominent developmental scientists whose work is explicitly driven by evolutionary concerns. Presenting sophisticated new models for understanding gene-environment interactions, the authors demonstrate how evolutionary knowledge can enhance our understanding of key aspects of cognitive, social, and personality development. Tightly edited chapters examine how different developmental mechanisms have evolved and what role they play in children's functioning and their adaptation to adult life. Essential topics covered include parent-child relationships, aggression, puberty, infant perception and cognition, memory, language, and more.},

	abstract = {The continual degradation of the planet's environment is something that affects every person in every country, be it developed or developing. Statements and policies are made at international levels, but their effectiveness is questionable. Also, are techniques of environmental managment (EM) used in the west appropriate and relevant to the much poorer developing countries' needs and priorities? How can these countries be expected to follow policies, or to even just have a responsible attitude to the environment, when the governments of western developed countries have failed to keep standards set or have side-stepped policies and repeatedly shrugged off any sense of global responsibility? Courses on environment and development usually have a strong environmental management component. By focusing on environmental management this book is very different from existing environment and development texts, whose emphasis is on listing problems, making warnings and voicing advocacy. This title moves on from these viewpoints to look at practical management and problem-solving techniques.; Environmental management, by definition, also encompasses global problems and future challenges for our increasingly globalised society. Environmental Management and Development clarifies the definition, nature and role of environmental management in development and developing countries. It begins with an introduction to the key terms, issues and tools of environmental management, which are linked and developed in the following chapters on specific environmental issues, making extensive use of global-local case studies. The book concludes by discussing who pays for EM and the future for EM in developing countries.},

	abstract = {Zoonoses are caused by microorganisms of animal origin that can also infect humans. Apart from human-to-human transmitted pathogens, they are the microorganisms of greatest concern in regard to threats to drinking-water and ambient water safety, now and in the future. A significant number of emerging and re-emerging waterborne zoonotic pathogens have been recognized over recent decades. SARS, E. coli O157: H7, and Cryptosporidium provide examples of zoonoses with waterborne routes of transmission. Developed from an expert workshop of 29 scientists convened by the World Health Organization and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Waterborne Zoonoses: Identification, Causes and Control provides a critical assessment of current knowledge about waterborne zoonoses and identifies strategies and research needs for controlling future emerging waterborne zoonoses.This book provides guidance to agriculturists, veterinarians, worldwide health agencies and water providers to anticipate potential future waterborne disease problems and to determine whether current practices will be protective or whether new approaches need to be deployed to better protect the health of both humans and animals},

Life first emerged a hundred million years later, and it took another fifteen million years for more complex life-forms to appear. Periods of relative calm were punctuated by five major extinctions, with innumerable minor jolts along the way. Then, five million years ago, an able ape evolved that gradually came to dominate and control the other animals and plants. The future now lies in the hands of this single species, Homo sapiens.In this carefully crafted story, Southwood's love of his subject, and for the life he describes, shines through, to engage and inform scientist and general reader alike.},

Focusing on the importance of open spaces in daily urban life, the book is divided into three sections. The first section describes the social, health, environmental and economic benefits and opportunities that open spaces can provide. The second section discusses the different types of urban open spaces that individuals or communities might use on a daily basis: from private gardens to commercial squares and waterway corridors. The final section provides best practice case-studies demonstrating urban spaces being incorporated in new developments and community initiatives. This is the first book to bring together a variety of evidence from different disciplines to outline the benefits and opportunities of urban open spaces in an accessible way. Not just for students and practitioners, this book will be of value for anyone interested in the design, development, regeneration, funding and use of open spaces in urban areas.},

Over the past two decades, the percentage of large smelt in the trawl survey has been reduced by 95 per cent.                 The effect on the overall smelt population is disproportionately large because the mature females are considerably more productive than their smaller counterparts. Another factor is the alarming decline of diporeia, a tiny shrimp-like crustacean that smelt feed on. Diporeia are already extinct in Lake Erie and increasingly rare in Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake Ontario, a phenomenon [Randy Owens] believes is linked to the introduction of zebra mussels into the Great Lakes in the '80s.                 On the right night, at the right spot, the bounty could be overwhelming and the annual smelt run developed into a ritual that was as sure a sign of spring as the blossoms on fruit trees. The best smelt, of course, were the ones that went directly into a frying pan over a beach fire and were consumed on the spot. The smelt run as a cultural phenomenon, the mass celebration of spring harvest, is past. A few diehards still stake out the wharves and shores, but the outrageous easy pickings are gone.},

Gelinas blasted Ottawa for slow progress in screening the estimated 23,000 industrial chemicals and 6,000 pesticides being used in Canada.

The purpose of the Conference was to enhance awareness of the European public, governments, the private sector and academia about the importance of responsible ocean and coastal management based on ocean science. Reflecting the innovative interdisciplinary approach of the conference, these volume groups contributors from leading biologists, political scientists, geographers, and jurists according to specific regional relevance and not along strict disciplinary lines. This approach allows the experts to treat marine issues concerning regions such as the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, or the Black Sea in a comprehensive manner.

This collection could become an essential instrument for scholars and scientists working within the field of marine environmental issues.},

And the binational effort begun in the 1970s to drastically reduce phosphorous inflows has been a success, further limiting the nutritional supply to the lake.                 While the abundance of new life in Lake Erie is great news to those concerned about its health, scientists meeting at this week's Lake Erie in the Millennium conference at the University of Windsor nevertheless harbour worries about this important source of nutrition they've discovered.                 [Bruce Manny] marvels at the "remarkable recovery from virtual extinction" of western Lake Erie's mayfly population, but he also wonders what this favourite bit of fish food, suspected to be feasting on sewage during its larval stage, might be introducing into the food web: "I thought, 'My God, what's in their food?'

	abstract = {Research Council established the Ecosystems Panel in response to a request from the United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The panel's charge included periodic reviews of the ecosystems aspects of the USGCRP, and this is the first of those reviews. It is based on information provided by the USGCRP, including Our Changing Planet (NSTC 1997 and earlier editions 1); ideas and conversations provided by participants in a workshop held in St. Michaels, Maryland, in July 1998; and the deliberations of the panel. In addition, the panel reviewed the ecosystems chapter of the NRC report Global Environmental Change: Research Pathways for the Next Decade (NRC 1999a, known as the Pathways report). 
The USGCRP is an interagency program established in 1989 and codified by the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (PL 101-606). The USGCRP comprises representatives of the departments of Agriculture, Commerce (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Institute of Standards and Technology), Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services (the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences), Interior, and State, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Smithsonian Institution, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, and the intelligence community (NSTC 1997). The USGCRP's research program is described in detail in Our Changing Planet (NSTC 1997, 1999). In brief, the program focuses on four major areas of earth-system science: 1) Seasonal to interannual climate variability; 2) Climate change over decades to centuries; 3) Changes in ozone, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and atmospheric chemistry, and 4) Changes in land cover and in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The fourth topic is the area in which advice was requested from the ecosystems panel.
The Ecosystems Panel's charge has three parts: to provide a forum for the discussion of questions of ecosystem science of interest to scientists in and out of the federal agencies, to periodically review the ecosystem aspects of the USGCRP's research program, and to help identify general areas of ecosystem science that need additional attention, especially areas that cut across ecosystems and levels of ecological organization. In addressing the second item of its charge for this report, the panel first identified the most significant and challenging areas in ecosystem science, then used that identification as a basis to make recommendations to the USGCRP. Thus, this report is not a detailed review of the USGCRP's program, but rather an attempt to identify those areas that the panel concludes are most in need of attention by a general research program on global change. As noted in this report, some of those areas are already receiving attention by the USGCRP.},

Perspectives on Biodiversity reviews current understanding of the value of biodiversity and the methods that are useful in assessing that value in particular circumstances.

Acknowledging that decisions about biodiversity are necessarily qualitative and change over time because of the nonmarket nature of so many of the values, the committee recommends periodic reviews of management decisions.

By eating the mussels, which are known to ingest cancer-causing PCBs from the sediment around them, the goby itself becomes contaminated and spreads the contaminants up the food chain, said John Casselman, the Ministry of Natural Resources' senior research scientist for Lake Ontario.                 Round gobies, which can grow to 25 centimetres long, feast on fish eggs and eat young sculpins, darters and perch. In lab experiments, gobies also ate eggs and fry of lake trout, a popular sport fish in Lake Ontario.},

After salmon and roe herring, shellfish harvesting is the most important and commercially valuable fishery in the province. It is worth more than all the remaining fisheries - - including cod, hake, red snapper and halibut -- combined.                 The imminent arrival of the green crab means shellfish growers in B.C. and Puget Sound might soon be forced to move from low-cost sea- bed production to a much more costly suspended system. And if experience elsewhere holds true, they will face an expensive installation of small-meshed nets to protect immature clam and oyster colonies from the voracious predator.},

The series has been edited by Professors Hester and Harrison since it began in 1994.
Professor Roy Harrison OBE is listed by ISI Thomson Scientific (on ISI Web of Knowledge) as a Highly Cited Researcher in the Environmental Science/Ecology category. He has an h-index of 54 (i.e. 54 of his papers have received 54 or more citations in the literature). In 2004 he was appointed OBE for services to environmental science in the New Year Honours List. He was profiled by the Journal of Environmental Monitoring (Vol 5, pp 39N-41N, 2003). Professor Harrison's research interests lie in the field of environment and human health. His main specialism is in air pollution, from emissions through atmospheric chemical and physical transformations to exposure and effects on human health. Much of this work is designed to inform the development of policy.
Now an emeritus professor, Professor Ron Hester's current activities in chemistry are mainly as an editor and as an external examiner and assessor. He also retains appointments as external examiner and assessor / adviser on courses, individual promotions, and departmental / subject area evaluations both in the UK and abroad.},

The Erie perch fishery, which barely managed to survive the onslaught of zebra mussels in recent years and sea lamprey before that, could find the ruffe to be the final punch.},

	abstract = {Coastal farming and ocean ranching of marine fish, shellfish, crustaceans, and seaweed are a major and growing industry worldwide. In the United States, freshwater aquaculture is rapidly becoming a significant commercial activity; however, marine aquaculture has lagged behind. 
This book examines the obstacles to developing marine aquaculture in the United States and offers specific recommendations for technology and policy strategies to encourage this industry. The volume provides a wealth of information on the status of marine aquaculture?including comparisons between U.S. and foreign approaches to policy and technology and of the diverse species under culture.

Marine Aquaculture also describes problems of coordination of regulatory policy among various federal, state, and local government agencies and escalating competition for the use of coastal waters. It addresses environmental concerns and suggests engineering and research strategies for alleviating negative impacts from marine aquaculture operations.},

	abstract = {This book draws on fields as diverse as biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, psychology, psychiatry, and ethology, to form a fascinating synthesis of information on the nature of fear and of panic and anxiety disorders. Dr. Marks offers both a detailed discussion of the clinical aspects of fear-related syndromes and a broad exploration of the sources and mechanisms of fear and defensive behavior. Dealing first with normal fear, he establishes a firm, scientific basis for understanding it. He then presents a thorough analysis of the development, symptoms and treatment of fear-related syndromes. Phobic and obsessive-compulsive disorders are examined in detail. The book is illustrated with examples of fear and defensive behavior in other living organisms. By drawing provocative analogies between animal and human behavior, it sheds new light on the origins of fears, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive problems, as well as on their treatment by drugs and psychological means. Clinical psychologists, ethologists, and anyone interested in the mechanisms of behavior will be fascinated by this authoritative study. The text is intriguing and informative, and the bibliography of over 2,100 entries makes it an invaluable reference.},
