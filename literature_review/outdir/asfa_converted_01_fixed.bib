	abstract = {Climate change interacts with the sources and cycling of contaminants, such as radionuclides, in the environment. In this review, we discuss the implications of climate change impacts on existing and potential future sources of radionuclides associated with human activities to the marine environment. The overall effect on operational releases of radionuclides from the nuclear and non-nuclear sectors will likely be increased interference or prevention of normal operations due to weather-related events. For certain radioactive waste dumped at sea and sunken nuclear submarines, the impact of climate change and ocean acidification on the release of radionuclides and their subsequent fate in the marine environment should be considered further. Fluxes from secondary sources of radionuclides in the marine and terrestrial environment and cryosphere will change in response to climate change impacts such as sea level rise, warming and changes in precipitation patterns. In addition, climate change impacts may increase the risk of releases of radionuclides from operational and legacy wastes on land to the marine environment. Overall, our synthesis highlights that there is a need to understand and assess climate change impacts on sources of radionuclides to the marine environment to meet environmental and management challenges under future climate scenarios.Inputs of radionuclides to the marine environment will be impacted by climate change, thus there is a pressing need to understand the existing and potential sources of radionuclides to assess the implications of climate change impacts, suggests a literature synthesis of radionuclide sources.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean basin has faced an increased influx of invasive species since the Suez Canal expansion in 2015. The invasive lionfish species, Pterois miles, has rapidly established new populations in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, impacting local fish biodiversity. Here, we have developed a new, fast ({\textless} 35 min) molecular approach to detect and quantify P. miles environmental DNA (eDNA) in combination with a portable device for field-based analysis. Using a species-specific real-time colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qcLAMP) for the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene, we demonstrate a high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 0.002 ng DNA per reaction, equivalent to only 50 copies of the COI gene. The assay is specific to the target in the presence of closely related and co-occurring species, and it is quantitative over five orders of magnitude. We validated the assay using aquarium water samples and further demonstrated its utility on natural eDNA samples collected from locations around the island of Crete where P. miles had been sighted. P. miles was indeed detected in three out of nine locations, two nature reserves and a closed bay. Lack of detection in the remaining locations suggests that populations are still at a low density. We also demonstrate the feasibility of P. miles eDNA qualitative detection directly from the filter used to collect eDNA-containing particles, completely omitting DNA extraction. Overall, we present a new approach for fast and targeted eDNA quantification. The developed LAMP assay together with the quantitative real-time colorimetric detection approach open new possibilities for monitoring invasive P. miles in the field.},

	abstract = {Chemical pollution in marine ecosystems is a factor of stress interacting in multiple and complex ways with other major causes of deterioration, such as warming seas due to climate change. Here we surveyed epibenthic communities from a shipwreck in the Levantine Basin for temporal and spatial changes in the community in relation to chronic oil pollution, comparing results collected from an area of the wreck characterized by chronic oil leakage with another area not affected by oil. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bioaccumulation analyses were integrated with characterization of the efficiency of xenobiotics biotransformation processes and antioxidant network of the scleractinian coral Madracis pharensis, chosen as bioindicator species. Results highlighted the two areas hosting different epibenthic communities over a period of 11 years. Significant changes in the percentage cover of M. pharensis could be the result of recent mass mortality associated to Marine Heat Waves. Biological investigation conducted in M. pharensis tissues revealed an increased content of PAHs in specimens collected from the oil-impacted area, coupled with an increased capability of oxyradicals scavenging capacity and a lower functionality of phase II biotransformation mechanisms associated to glutathione S-transferase. Overall, the results suggest that M. pharensis has the capability to develop cellular and physiological adaptations to chemical-mediated stress, with yet unknown possible energy trade-offs to sustain stress response.},

Risk management authorities need tools to identify pathways and source regions of priority concern to better target efforts for preventing NIS introduction. The probability of a successful NIS introduction is affected by the likelihood that a marine species entrained in a transport vector will survive the voyage between origin and destination locations and establish an independently reproducing population at the destination. Three important risk factors are voyage duration, range of environmental conditions encountered during transit and environmental similarity between origin and destination. In this study, we aimed for a globally comprehensive approach to assembling quantifications of source-destination risk factors from every potential origin to every potential destination. To derive estimates of voyage-related marine biosecurity risk, we used computer-simulated vessel paths between pairs of ecoprovinces in the Marine Ecoregions Of the World biogeographic classification system. We used the physical length of each path to calculate voyage duration risk and the cross-latitudinal extent of the path to calculate voyage path risk. Environmental similarity risk was based on comparing annual average sea surface temperature and salinity within each ecoprovince to those of other ecoprovinces. We derived three separate sets of risk quantifications, one each for voyage duration, voyage path and environmental similarity. Our quantifications can be applied to studies that require source-destination risk estimates. They can be used separately or combined, depending on the importance of the types of source-destination risks that might be relevant to particular scientific or risk management questions or applications.},

One spectacular example is the western Atlantic invasion by lionfishes. In the Mediterranean Sea, invasions from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal (termed Lessepsian invasions) comprise more than 100 fish species, including a recent invasion by lionfish. In light of the devastating effects of lionfish in the Caribbean Sea, understanding the dynamics of Mediterranean lionfish invasion is crucial. The Lessepsian lionfish invasion started in 2012, and rapidly spread to the central Mediterranean. Here, we used thousands of RAD seq genomic markers to study the population dynamics of this invasion. While we did not find a reduction in genetic diversity between source (Red Sea) and invasive (Mediterranean) populations (i.e., bottleneck effects), we found evidence of population structure within the invasive range in the Mediterranean Sea. We found that loci that are potentially under selection may play an important role in invasion success (in particular, genes involved in osmoregulation and fin spine sizes). Genomic approaches proved powerful in examining the ecological and evolutionary patterns of successful invaders and may be used as tools to understand and potentially mitigate future invasions.},

	abstract = {As invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) continue to spread through the freshwaters of the United States, efforts have been made to develop mussel invasion risk assessments to focus invasion prevention, monitoring, rapid response, and macrofouling control on at-risk water bodies. Previous invasion risk assessments have been based on broadly applied single factors such as calcium concentration or summer water temperature or on global scale climate variables. While such factors applied on a nationwide basis provide a general overview of regions susceptible to mussel invasion, they do not determine mussel invasion risk for specific water bodies, which can be variable even among those that are closely adjacent. Furthermore, these broad risk assessments may over or underestimate risk due to lack of water body specificity. In order to develop effective mussel prevention and control strategies, managers need mussel invasion risk assessments that can be applied to specific water bodies allowing limited resources to be focused on those most likely to be invaded. This study reports the use of easily determined factors (i.e., calcium concentration, pH, salinity, and summer surface water temperature) to specifically determine mussel invasion risk for 133 Texas water bodies as a case study of simplistic methods with broad geographic applicability. The results indicated that 19.5\% of the water bodies had a minimal invasion risk, 9.8\% a moderate risk, and 70.7\% a high risk. This study demonstrates that these methods provide finer scale risk assessment for Texas water bodies in this case study, finding higher risk in western and southern regions than was predicted by climate-based risk assessments and more nuanced risk levels in the eastern region than predictions based on calcium alone. These methods can provide invaluable information for natural resource managers and water infrastructure operators on a broad geographic scale to guide monitoring and mitigation efforts.},

	abstract = {Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) are a principal threat to global biodiversity and the early detection of new introductions is key to facilitate a rapid response to limit the risk of establishment and spread. Related to this, there is growing interest in using environmental DNA (eDNA) for INNS detection. The applied use of eDNA in ecology is, however, in its relative infancy with few species for which regulator-approved methods are available. Here, laboratory trials were conducted to investigate the use of commercially available eDNA assays for detecting two high priority INNS in the UK, killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus) and signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), at different population densities. For killer shrimp, DNA of the expected fragment size was detected from all three trials where animals were maintained at a density of 1 per 1 L but species confirmation by Sanger sequencing was only possible for one of these replicates. Whilst capillary electrophoresis detected DNA of the expected fragment size in serially diluted samples down to a density of 1 shrimp in 100 L, this could not be confirmed by sequencing. Signal crayfish DNA was detected by qPCR in all four trials where animals were housed at a density of 1 per 10 L. Using serial dilutions, it was possible to detect signal crayfish in samples representing a density of 1 per 1,000 L, however this was unreliable. These results demonstrate the potential for using eDNA as a detection method for killer shrimp and signal crayfish but also highlights that detectability is species/assay specific and dependant on population density. The insights gained will help inform decisions surrounding the appropriateness of using these eDNA assays, and improve interpretation of any results generated.},

	abstract = {Human trade and movements are central to biological invasions worldwide. Human activities not only transport species across biogeographical barriers, but also accelerate their post-introduction spread in the landscape. Thus, by constraining human movements, the spatial structure of road networks might greatly affect the regional spread of invasive species. However, few invasion models have accounted for the topology of road networks so far, and its importance for explaining the regional distribution of invasive species remains mostly unexplored. To address this issue, we developed a spatially explicit and mechanistic human-mediated dispersal model that accounts and tests for the influence of transport networks on the regional spread of invasive species. Using as a model the spread of the invasive ant Lasius neglectus in the middle Rhône valley (France), we show that accounting for the topology of road networks improves our ability to explain the current distribution of the invasive ant. In contrast, we found that using human population density as a proxy for the frequency of transport events decreases models' performance and might thus not be as appropriate as previously thought. Finally, by differentiating road networks into sub-networks, we show that national and regional roads are more important than smaller roads for explaining spread patterns. Overall, our results demonstrate that the topology of transport networks can strongly bias regional invasion patterns and highlight the importance of better incorporating it into future invasion models. The mechanistic modelling approach developed in this study should help invasion scientists explore how human-mediated dispersal and topography shape invasion dynamics in landscapes. Ultimately, our approach could be combined with demographic, natural dispersal and environmental suitability models to refine spread scenarios and improve invasive species monitoring and management at regional to national scales.Keywords: biological invasions, human-mediated dispersal, road network, secondary spread, spatially explicit model, stochastic jump model},

This study focuses on the banded mystery snail, Callinina georgiana, an invasive species in the Adirondack region of northern New York, an important section of the New York Great Lakes Basin. This project aims to explore the genetic connectivity of C. georgiana within its invasive range using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Sampling was conducted in the Raquette River and adjacent waterways, with a total of 229 snails collected from 16 distinct populations distributed across eight different waterbodies. Also included were two populations from the species native range in the southern United States. DNA was extracted, and a 710 bp fragment of the mtDNA marker COI and a 351 bp fragment of nuclear marker Histone3 (H3) were amplified. Population genetic analyses including haplotype patterning, AMOVA and genetic diversity estimates, neutrality tests and tests for isolation by distance (IBD) were performed to assess connectivity patterns. Results showed moderate to high levels of genetic admixture within the invasive range as indicated by the lack of geographic patterning of haplotypes and low to moderate levels of genetic differentiation across multiple sites. Demographic analyses combined with high numbers of private haplotypes indicate population expansion. Interestingly, a case of mitonuclear discordance was detected for native and invasive populations as evident by incongruent haplotype patterns for the COI and H3 markers. Callinina georgiana exhibits a high level of genetic connectivity in its invasive range. The presence of dams does not significantly affect gene flow, indicating that anthropogenic activities, such as boat traffic might be key in dispersing the snails across this fragmented freshwater system. This study offers new insights into the dispersal and genetic structure of an invasive freshwater snail. It highlights the importance of considering anthropogenic factors when confronting complex patterns of genetic diversity. The findings are significant for biodiversity conservation and provide a basis for developing strategies to manage and contain the spread of AIS like C. georgiana, especially in regions with high human activity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Management aquifer recharge(MAR) technology is widely applied to solve seawater intrusion caused by groundwater overexploitation in coastal areas. However, MAR creates an important pathway for microplastics (particle size {\textless} 5 mm) to enter groundwater. To explore the clogging potential of microplastics in aquifer media, a series of laboratory-scale column experiments were conducted in this study. The hydraulic conductivity of porous media and deposition amount of microplastics were investigated under different experimental conditions. In our study, most of the microplastics were intercepted in the sand column's surface layer. The difference of particle size in porous media greatly influence the clogging development. The hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer media decreased as the microplastic particle size decreased. When the particle size of microplastic was larger than 300 mm, most of the microplastics deposits on the surface of the porous media, forming a "microplastic accumulation layer". Microplastics are affected by particle size, flow shear stress and preferential flow during migration. The migration ability of microplastics increased significantly with the increase of hydraulic head difference and decreased with the increase of sand column depth. The bacteria microorganisms are projected to be a new biological control strategy in conjunction with MAR. The study of clogging risk of microplastics particles in porous media during 2 artificial recharge provides novel and unique insights for the management and control of microplastic pollution in groundwater systems.},

	abstract = {While eDNA approaches have gained interest over the past decades all types of organisms have not been addressed evenly. In particular terrestrial plants have been the subject of less attention. Here we address the possibility to represent plant biodiversity from airborne environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling and metabarcoding. We collected air using a biological air sampler in the Botanical Garden of Montpellier (France) and compared the list of revealed plant species to the botanical inventory of the Garden. Ninety-two plant species could be detected from three sampling points across the 4,6 ha of the Garden, after one hour sampling allowing to filter 9 m3 of air. We recorded the plants carrying flowers at the time of the experiment, which allowed us to estimate that plants flowering at the time of the sampling could be detected 10 times more easily than plants that were not, given the number of plants carrying flowers. However, flowering is far from being required as a vast majority of plants still was detected without flowering. We also show that not all species orders are detected with the same probability, tree species being better represented in the sample than herbal plants, given the number of trees present in the garden. Finally using diagnostic species, present only once in the garden, we estimate that the maximum sampling distance allowed by the biological air sampler is at least 110 m. Our study underlines that air sampling is a promising method for monitoring terrestrial plant biodiversity and highlights the parameters that should be adjusted to optimize the approach.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a growing awareness of the critical role that maritime transport plays in global sustainability, given its significant environmental, economic, and social impacts. Central to this concern is the management of ballast water, which, if not properly treated, can lead to the introduction of invasive species, biodiversity loss, and substantial economic and health repercussions. Traditional risk assessment models often fail to capture the complex uncertainties inherent in environmental risks associated with ballast water. This study introduces an innovative fuzzy logic-based risk assessment model designed to enhance decision-making processes in maritime operations by accurately assessing and mitigating the environmental risks of ballast water discharge. The model, structured using three fuzzy systems, integrates human reasoning with mathematical precision, providing an effective tool for sustainable maritime practices. The integrated fuzzy system employs 18 variables as inputs and yields three outputs (ballasting, ballast exchange, and de-ballasting risk). To evaluate the performance of the developed system, various data sets are used and tested through the MATLAB Fuzzy Toolbox. By aligning maritime operations with sustainability principles, this research contributes to the preservation of marine ecosystems, supports the economic stability of marine-dependent industries, and safeguards public health, underscoring the interconnectivity of maritime transport management with overarching sustainability objectives.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms encode proteins that function in the transformations of useful and harmful nitrogenous compounds in the global nitrogen cycle. The major transformations in the nitrogen cycle are nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation, and ammonification. The focus of this report is the complex biogeochemical process of denitrification, which, in the complete form, consists of a series of four enzyme-catalyzed reduction reactions that transforms nitrate to nitrogen gas. Denitrification is a microbial strain-level ecological trait (characteristic), and denitrification potential (functional performance) can be inferred from trait rules that rely on the presence or absence of genes for denitrifying enzymes in microbial genomes. Despite the global significance of denitrification and associated large-scale genomic and scholarly data sources, there is lack of datasets and interactive computational tools for investigating microbial genomes according to denitrification trait rules. Therefore, our goal is to categorize archaeal and bacterial genomes by denitrification potential based on denitrification traits defined by rules of enzyme involvement in the denitrification reduction steps. We report the integration of datasets on genome, taxonomic lineage, ecosystem, and denitrifying enzymes to provide data investigations context for the denitrification potential of microbial strains. We constructed an ecosystem and taxonomic annotated denitrification potential dataset of 62,624 microbial genomes (866 archaea and 61,758 bacteria) that encode at least one of the twelve denitrifying enzymes in the four-step canonical denitrification pathway. Our four-digit binary-coding scheme categorized the microbial genomes to one of sixteen denitrification traits including complete denitrification traits assigned to 3280 genomes from 260 bacteria genera. The bacterial strains with complete denitrification potential pattern included Arcobacteraceae strains isolated or detected in diverse ecosystems including aquatic, human, plant, and Mollusca (shellfish). The dataset on microbial denitrification potential and associated interactive data investigations tools can serve as research resources for understanding the biochemical, molecular, and physiological aspects of microbial denitrification, among others. The microbial denitrification data resources produced in our research can also be useful for identifying microbial strains for synthetic denitrifying communities.},

	abstract = {Climate change and associated shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns have become an increasing concern as drivers of ongoing biodiversity loss. The Mediterranean region is particularly vulnerable, being both a biodiversity hotspot and a region very prone to desertification. Freshwater mussels are amongst the most threatened invertebrate taxa worldwide. Unio tumidiformis is an endemic and endangered species restricted to the southern Iberian Peninsula, living in temporary Mediterranean-type streams. Freshwater mussels need a fish host for successful larval transformation, meaning U. tumidiformis must belong to the genus Squalius. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the vulnerability of U. tumidiformis to climate change, by studying its population genetics and evolutionary history, its current and future habitat suitability, and that of its hosts. Genetic population structure and diversity were assessed using Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms through Genotyping by Sequencing and used to infer species evolutionary history. The species potential distribution was modeled using an ensemble forecasting approach, and future shifts in habitat suitability were assessed with the projected climate data layers from Worldclim. Most populations showed extreme genetic differentiation (Fst up to 0.745), even from close neighboring ones. Upper Guadiana populations were more diverse and less differentiated. We hypothesize that U. tumidiformis originated in Upper Guadiana and followed the same colonization routes as their hosts with numerous founder effects and bottlenecks. Our results also predicted a reduction of 99\% of climatically suitable areas for U. tumidiformis in the Iberian Peninsula until 2040. For the fish hosts, a maximum 42\% reduction in suitable areas was estimated throughout the century, with remaining adequate habitats in the north. Our results suggest that difficult conservation options are necessary, prioritizing the preservation of populations, translocations to the northern area of its historical range and stream engineering to increase resilience to droughts.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryThe apple snail is one of the most dangerous invasive species in freshwater environments. Using molecular and morphological tools, we re-describe an echinostomatid digenean parasitizing snails from two sites in the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. The two stages found (i.e., rediae and metacercariae) demonstrate that the apple snail acts as the first and second intermediate host in its life cycle. The prevalence of the parasite was higher at one of the sampling sites, probably because the birds bearing the adult stage are more abundant in that area. A histological study showed that this parasite quickly invades multiple organs of the snail, which is different from most digenean infections, which only infect the gonad and digestive glands. Heavy deterioration of female and male reproductive structures associated with the presence of the parasite was also observed, which indicates castration.AbstractPomacea canaliculata is one of the most dangerous invasive species. Morphological and molecular analyses have revealed that a digenean species belonging to the family Echinostomatidae parasitizes this snail at two sites in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, South America. Molecular results confirmed that the species belongs to a genus closely related to Patagifer. Analysis of the 28S rDNA showed that the sequences of the rediae and metacercariae are identical, indicating that the apple snail acts as the first and second intermediate host. The cercariae may encyst as metacercaria inside the redia and also emerge and re-infect the same snail or another snail. The prevalence of digeneans was higher in one of the sampling locations (15.1\% vs. 0.72\%), probably because the bird species that acts as the definitive host is more abundant in that area. Histopathological examination showed that the parasite quickly invades multiple host organs (gills, intestines, albumen gland, lung, kidney, and mantle border) besides the gonad and digestive gland, as is usual in digeneans. In addition, the partial or total castration of snails was observed in cases of moderate and high infection intensity. In males, there was loss of integrity in testicular tubules, while in females, the replacement of ovarian tissue by rediae was found.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a three-dimensional continuous time dynamical system of three species, two of which are competing preys and one is a predator. We also assume that during predation, the members of both teams of preys help each other and the rate of predation of both teams is different. The interaction between prey and predator is assumed to be governed by a Holling type II functional response and discrete type gestation delay of the predator for consumption of the prey. In this work, we establish the local asymptotic stability of various equilibrium points to understand the dynamics of the model system. Different conditions for the coexistence of equilibrium solutions are discussed. Persistence, permanence of the system, and global stability of the positive interior equilibrium solution are discussed by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions when the gestation delay is zero, and there is no periodic orbit within the interior of the first quadrant of state space around the interior equilibrium. As we introduced time delay due to the gestation of the predator, we also discuss the stability of the delayed model. It is observed that the existence of stability switching occurs around the interior equilibrium point as the gestation delay increases through a certain critical threshold. Here, a phenomenon of Hopf bifurcation occurs, and a stable limit cycle corresponding to the periodic solution of the system is also observed. This study reveals that the delay is taken as a bifurcation parameter and also plays a significant role for the stability of the proposed model. Computer simulations of numerical examples are given to explain our proposed model. We have also addressed critically the biological implications of our analytical findings with proper numerical examples.},

Copper (Cu) is one of the most spread heavy metals in water, and can severely affect primary producers at high doses. Here we show a novel imaging test to assay the dose-dependent effects of Cu on live microalgae identifying stress conditions when they are still capable of sustaining a positive growth. The method relies on Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM), capable to image large field of view in label-free phase-contrast mode attaining submicron lateral resolution. We uniquely combine FPM with a new multi-scale analysis method based on fractal geometry. The system is able to provide ensemble measurements of thousands of diatoms in the liquid sample simultaneously, while ensuring at same time single-cell imaging and analysis for each diatom. Through new image descriptors, we demonstrate that fractal analysis is suitable for handling the complexity and informative power of such multiscale FPM modality. We successfully tested this new approach by measuring how different concentrations of Cu impact on Skeletonema pseudocostatum diatom populations isolated from the Sarno River mouth.},

The ingestion of plastics by the invasive signal crayfish in the Wieprza River, a tributary to the Baltic Sea, was determined by the FTIR identification of plastic compounds found in stomachs. The occurrence of plastic debris in the stomachs of P. leniusculus is reported for the first time. Plastic particles with the size range between 70 and 450 µm were observed only among crayfish inhabiting the lower, urbanized part of the river (7.3\% of specimens). The presence of PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene), cellophane, PP (polypropylene), PE (polyethylene), PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), and nylon was confirmed with the highest frequency of PTFE in the stomachs of crayfish. Fibres were the predominant type of microplastics in crayfish stomachs. The results indicated the size-selective uptake and ingestion of plastics depending on the traits of the species and environment.},

	abstract = {Inorganic arsenic is a well-known carcinogen that is much more toxic than its organic counterpart. While much is known about the accumulation and transformation of arsenic in marine organisms, little is known regarding these processes in freshwater aquatic species. In this study, the acute toxicity and toxicological effects of inorganic arsenic on four freshwater organisms (Cyprinus carpio, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, Pseudorasbora parva, Eriocheir sinensis) commonly found in rice-fish farming systems were investigated. The organisms exhibited different levels of sensitivity to inorganic arsenic, with crustaceans being more sensitive than fish. Fish were found to be more tolerant to As(V) than As(III). The study also investigated the accumulation, transformation, and release of inorganic arsenic in crucian carp, an omnivorous species with high environmental tolerance. The fish accumulated As(III) rapidly in various tissues, and were able to transport it to other tissues through gills, intestines, and skin. The accumulated As(III) was converted into less toxic forms, such as monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), via methylation. The fish also converted As(III) into arsenate (AsV) via enzymatic and oxidative reactions. After the transferal to clean water, the forms of arsenic in the various tissues decreased rapidly, but the rates of excretion of the four forms of arsenic were not the same among the different tissues. Our results suggest that crucian carp can reduce the environmental toxicity of As(III) at certain concentrations by transforming it into less toxic forms within their bodies.},

	abstract = {In recent years, micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) have represented an emerging threat for the aquatic environment due to their persistence and widespread distribution. Indeed, their small size and increased surface area lead to a high biological reactivity, which can be crucial for the health status of biota. To date, several studies have investigated lethal and sublethal endpoints of MNPs, while one of the main challenges is to understand their mechanisms of toxicity in a comprehensive manner. With this aim, the field of aquatic ecotoxicology can now benefit from the -omics approaches. This review focuses on the recent advances related to the use of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to deeply investigate the molecular and biochemical responses of aquatic organisms, both fishes and aquatic invertebrates, to pristine polystyrene (PS) MNPs. The literature reviewed revealed that transcriptomics and metabolomics are the most frequently used -omic approaches. Overall, the studies taken into consideration shed light on the events triggered by PS MNPs at molecular and cellular levels, identifying as mechanisms of toxicity the pathways involved in oxidative stress, energy metabolism, immune response, and the nervous system. Future studies should therefore focus on the use and integration of multi-omics approaches for a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in MNPs toxicity.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryBiological invasion, particularly by the invasive mussel Mytella strigata (Hanley, 1843), has led to a significant decline in the population of native Perna viridis (Linnaeus, 1758) in western Pacific regions. This study compared the intestinal microbiota, metabolome, and key digestive enzymes of these two competing mussels to elucidate their differences from intestinal microbiota and metabolic points. The analysis revealed differences in the abundance of Bacteroidota related to carbohydrate degradation, as well as enriched metabolites and higher carbohydrase activities in M. strigata compared to P. viridis. These findings suggested that these differences might contribute to the adaptation of M. strigata to its new environment, providing valuable insights into the competition between these species for food resources.AbstractBiological invasion is a primary direct driver of biodiversity loss. Recently, owing to exploitation competition with an invasive mussel, Mytella strigata (Hanley, 1843), there has been a drastic decrease in the population of native Perna viridis (Linnaeus, 1758) in several western Pacific regions. In the present study, intestinal microbiota, metabolome, and key digestive enzyme activities were compared between the two competing mussels, M. strigata and P. viridis, to elucidate the differences in intestinal microbiota and metabolic points. We observed that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota were the three predominant bacterial phyla in the two species. The relative abundance of Bacteroidota related to carbohydrate-degrading ability was significantly higher in M. strigata than in P. viridis. Compared to P. viridis, different metabolites including maltose and trehalose were enriched in M. strigata. Lastly, higher carbohydrases activities of alpha-amylase, cellulase, and xylanase were observed in M. strigata than in P. viridis. These differences might play an important role in the adaptation process of M. strigata to the new environment. This study provides important basic knowledge for investigating the competition between M. strigata and P. viridis in terms of food resources utilization.},

	abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can have a positive impact on flora and fauna by limiting direct human impact in these areas. Estuaries were added to the MPA framework to protect nursery habitat for recreationally and commercially important fish species. This study evaluates how protection status and inlet status structure fish communities, with a focus on nursery provision as well as evaluates how capture method and sampling effort can be combined into a monitoring framework to target a wide range of species and functional groups. Data from seines and baited remote underwater videos indicate that there are significant differences between estuary types (both protected and non-protected areas and temporarily closed and permanently open). While MPAs did differ from non-MPAs, the inlet status of protected and non-protected areas was potentially a more important driver of fish community structure as the frequency of an inlets closure influenced important abiotic variables such as dissolved oxygen, water temperature and salinity. Capture methods used in this study significantly differed from each other in the fish and guilds that they targeted. This reinforces the importance of method selection when designing a monitoring framework and assessing community compositions between systems. Seines targeted the widest range of fish but were most effective with smaller species, while angler observations in Batiquitos Lagoon Carlsbad California were most effective at targeting larger roving fish species. Fishing pressure did not appear to have a negative impact on nursery function in Batiquitos Lagoon, with some of the most diverse communities seen in this study. Overall, results indicate that capture methods are important, as communities in perennially open systems and temporarily closed systems are significantly different from each other and utilizing a diverse range of capture methods can help to properly assess these communities.},

However, improvements in ease of use and portability could increase the utility of eDNA methods, leading to more widespread application, including expanding its role in management decision-making processes. We describe the development of an eDNA detection assay for delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered fish in the San Francisco Estuary, using SHERLOCK (Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter Unlocking). SHERLOCK is a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based diagnostic tool with the ability to detect species-specific genetic variants, making it ideal for genetic-based taxonomic identification of any organism. Because of its high sensitivity and specificity, SHERLOCK is adaptable to eDNA detection in water samples. Here, we describe adaptation of a delta smelt SHERLOCK assay for use with estuarine water eDNA samples. This version of the assay exhibits increased sensitivity compared to the original delta smelt SHERLOCK protocol (new limit of detection approximately three copies per reaction compared to {\textasciitilde}300 in original assay) and successfully detected delta smelt eDNA in both experimental and natural contexts. Overall, our results demonstrate that SHERLOCK eDNA detection offers managers an alternative, isothermal methodology, and highlights some challenges for detection of rare, endangered species at low abundance.},

	abstract = {The economic and methodological efficiencies of environmental DNA (eDNA) based survey approaches provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess and monitor aquatic environments. However, instances of inadequate communication from the scientific community about confidence levels, knowledge gaps, reliability, and appropriate parameters of eDNA-based methods have hindered their uptake in environmental monitoring programs and, in some cases, has created misperceptions or doubts in the management community. To help remedy this situation, scientists convened a session at the Second National Marine eDNA Workshop to discuss strategies for improving communications with managers. These include articulating the readiness of different eDNA applications, highlighting the strengths and limitations of eDNA tools for various applications or use cases, communicating uncertainties associated with specified uses transparently, and avoiding the exaggeration of exploratory and preliminary findings. Several key messages regarding implementation, limitations, and relationship to existing methods were prioritized. To be inclusive of the diverse managers, practitioners, and researchers, we and the other workshop participants propose the development of communication workflow plans, using RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) charts to clarify the roles of all pertinent individuals and parties and to minimize the chance for miscommunications. We also propose developing decision support tools such as Structured Decision-Making (SDM) to help balance the benefits of eDNA sampling with the inherent uncertainty, and developing an eDNA readiness scale to articulate the technological readiness of eDNA approaches for specific applications. These strategies will increase clarity and consistency regarding our understanding of the utility of eDNA-based methods, improve transparency, foster a common vision for confidently applying eDNA approaches, and enhance their benefit to the monitoring and assessment community.},

O Paraguai é uma país cercado por terra com pouca informação sobre a sua malacofauna. Com o objetivo de preencher algumas destas lacunas, uma expedição de campo foi organizada a fim de analisar a distribuição dos bivalves invasores no Paraguai. Foram realizadas 41 estações de coleta em sete departamentos do Paraguai. A busca pelos bivalves foi feita utilizando pés e mãos. Todos os pontos foram georreferenciados e algumas variáveis ambientais foram medidas. Os resultados indicam a presença de três espécies de bivalves invasores no Paraguai: Corbicula fluminea, C. largillierti e Limnoperna fortunei. O berbigão asiático Corbicula fluminea foi a espécie com a distribuição mais ampla, cobrindo os principais rios e tributários, em quatro ecoregiões de água doce do Paraguai. As outras duas espécies apresentaram uma distribuição mais restrita. Corbicula largillierti foi encontrado no Baixo rio Paraná, enquanto Limnoperna fortunei foi encontrado na calha principal do rio Paraguai e no Baixo rio Paraná. As espécies invasoras foram encontradas em três unidades de conservação e pode representar a ameaça para a pouco conhecida fauna de bivalves nativos do Paraguai. As espécies de bivalves invasores estão amplamente distribuídas no Paraguai. Medidas de mitigação são necessárias para evitar que estas espécies se dispersem ainda mais, provocando mais efeitos negativos sobre as espécies nativas.Alternate abstract:La Plata Basin is the second largest hydrographic system in South America but the most impacted by invasive species of molluscs in the continent. Paraguay is a land-surrounded South American country with scarce information about malacological fauna. To fill some of these gaps, a large field expedition was conducted to analyze the distribution of invasive freshwater bivalves in Paraguay. The field survey encompassed 41 sampling stations in seven Departments of Paraguay. The mussels were searched using bare hands and feet. All stations were georeferenced and some environmental parameters were measured. Results indicated the presence of three invasive species of freshwater bivalves in Paraguay: Corbicula fluminea, C. largillierti, and Limncperna fortunei. The Asiatic clam Corbicula fluminea was the most widespread invasive species, covering main rivers and small tributaries in the four freshwater ecoregions of Paraguay. The two remaining invasive species were more restricted. Corbicula largillierti were found at the lower section of the Paraná River, and Limncperna fortunei inhabits the main river canals of the Paraguay River and the lower section of the Paraná River. The invasive species were found in three protected areas of Paraguay and can represent a threat to the mostly unknown fauna of native mussels. The invasive bivalves are widespread in Paraguay. Mitigation measurements must be taken to avoid the spread of these species and more drawbacks over native fauna.},

	abstract = {Contamination of the environment with nano- and microplastic particles exerts a threatening impact on the aquatic ecosystems and sustainable catfish aquaculture. The presence of nanoplastics has been found to have a detrimental impact on both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The present study examines the effect of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs) on the DNA, erythrocytes, oxidative status and renal histology of catfish, in addition to the potential protective effects of Chlorella vulgaris bioremediation and selenium to hinder this effect. Six equal groups of fish were used as follows: Group 1 served as a control group and received water free from PS NPs; Group 2 was exposed to PS NPs at a concentration of 5 mg/L; Group 3 was exposed to PS NPs (5 mg/L) + selenium (1 mg/kg diet); Group 4 was exposed to PS NPs (5 mg/L) + C. vulgaris (25 g/kg diet); Group 5 was supplemented with C. vulgaris (25 g/kg diet); and Group 6 was supplemented with selenium (1 mg/kg diet). The exposure period was 30 days. The results indicated that PS NPs induced oxidative stress by significantly elevating malondialdehyde activities and slightly reducing antioxidant biomarkers, resulting in DNA damage, increased frequency of micronuclei, erythrocyte alterations, and numerous histopathological alterations in kidney tissue. Selenium and C. vulgaris significantly ameliorated the oxidative/antioxidant status, reducing DNA damage, micronucleus frequency, erythrocyte alterations, and improving the morphology of kidney tissue. Nevertheless, further research is needed for a profound understanding of the mechanism behind the toxicity of nano-microplatics in aquatic systems.},

	abstract = {Bivalves can concentrate biological and chemical pollutants, causing foodborne outbreaks whose occurrence is increasing, due to climatic and anthropic factors that are difficult to reverse, hence the need for improved surveillance. This study aimed to evaluate the hygienic qualities of bivalves sampled along the production and distribution chain in Sicily and collect useful data for consumer safety. Bacteriological and molecular analyses were performed on 254 samples of bivalves for the detection of enteropathogenic Vibrio, Arcobacter spp., Aeromonas spp., Salmonella spp., and beta-glucuronidase-positive Escherichia coli. A total of 96 out of 254 samples, collected in the production areas, were processed for algal biotoxins and heavy metals detection. Bacterial and algal contaminations were also assessed for 21 samples of water from aquaculture implants. Vibrio spp., Arcobacter spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., and Escherichia coli were detected in 106/254, 79/254, 12/254, 16/254, and 95/254 molluscs, respectively. A total of 10/96 bivalves tested positive for algal biotoxins, and metals were under the legal limit. V. alginolyticus, A. butzleri, and E. coli were detected in 5, 3, and 3 water samples, respectively. Alexandrium minutum, Dinophysis acuminata, Lingulodinium polyedra, and Pseudonitzschia spp. were detected in water samples collected with the biotoxin-containing molluscs. Traces of yessotoxins were detected in molluscs from water samples containing the corresponding producing algae. Despite the strict regulation by the European Commission over shellfish supply chain monitoring, our analyses highlighted the need for efficiency improvement.},

	abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a primary environmental concern, threatening freshwater ecosystems and public health and causing economic damages in the billions of dollars annually. These blooms, predominantly driven by phytoplankton species like cyanobacteria, thrive in nutrient-rich, warm, and low-wind environments. Because of the adverse impacts of HABs, this review examines various control methods, focusing on biological strategies as sustainable solutions. While effective in disrupting algal populations, traditional chemical and physical interventions carry ecological risks and can be resource-intensive. Biological control methods, including biomanipulation and using algicidal microorganisms such as Streptococcus thermophiles, Myxobacteria, and Lopharia spadicea, emerge as eco-friendly alternatives offering long-term benefits. Additionally, barley and rice straw application has demonstrated efficacy in curbing HAB growth. These biological approaches work by inhibiting algal proliferation, disrupting cellular structures, and fostering algal cell aggregation. Despite their advantages over conventional methods, biological controls face challenges, including intricate ecological interactions. This article delves into the latest biological techniques aimed at eradicating HABs, intending to diminish their frequency and reduce toxin levels in aquatic environments. While most research to date has been confined to laboratory settings, scaling these methods to field applications presents hurdles due to the variability and complexity of natural ecosystems. The review underscores the need for further research and development in this critical area of environmental science.},

	abstract = {Shellfish reefs around the world have become degraded, and recent efforts have focused on restoring these valuable habitats. This study is the first to assess the efficacy of a bouchot-style reef, where mussels were seeded onto wooden stakes and deployed in a hypereutrophic estuary in Australia. While {\textgreater}60\% of translocated mussels survived one month, after ten months, only 2\% remained alive, with this mortality being accompanied, at least initially, by declining body condition. Mussel survival, growth, body condition and recruitment were greater on the top section of the stake, implying that the distance from the substrate was important. More fish species inhabited the reefs (31) than unstructured control sites (17). Reefs were also colonised by a range of invertebrate species, including 11 native and six non-indigenous species. However, the number of individuals declined from 4495 individuals from 14 species in December 2019 to 35 individuals representing 4 species in March 2021, likely due to hypoxic bottom water conditions following unseasonal rainfall. Although the bouchot-style reefs were unable to sustain mussels and other invertebrates over sequential years, this approach has the potential to be successful if deployed in shallow water or intertidal zones, which are largely exempt from biotic and abiotic stressors characteristic of deeper waters in microtidal estuaries.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryThe development of cost-effective protocols with optimized rearing systems and conditions is an essential requirement to assure the economic feasibility of mussel production in hatchery systems. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis plays a relevant role on the scale of bivalve aquaculture, whose expansion has deep economic and environmental consequences. The current study establishes the protocols to improve pediveliger settlement, post-larvae production and growth, through the optimization of the stocking density of larvae and post-larvae in hatchery systems. This standardized protocol for mussel rearing can enhance the production of quality seed to supply the fattening industry as well as for environmental restoration.AbstractIn mussel hatchery systems, the settlement process is a crucial element influencing seed yield. The current study assayed the influence of five densities of competent pediveliger larvae on settlement success and post-larvae production. We showed an inverse relationship between density and settlement efficiency, e.g., an attachment success of 99.4\% at the lowest density (35 larvae/cm2) but only 9\% at the highest density (210 larvae/cm2). However, post-larvae production was higher at intermediate larvae densities (70 larvae/cm2). The reimplementation of treatments upon post-larvae density after 6 weeks post settlement showed that the lowest-density groups bore both the highest post-larvae growth rate (22.24 ± 4.60 µm/day) and the largest head batch (48\% of the size distribution), as compared to the higher-post-larvae-density groups. These results highlight the importance of optimizing both pediveliger larvae density and post-larvae density, to maximize high-quality seed yield in local hatcheries. Current rearing technologies would assure a timely commercial seed production to protect natural sea rocky beds in Alboran Sea coasts.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean basin has seen an increased influx of invasive species since the Suez Canal expansion in 2015. The invasive lionfish species, Pterois miles, has rapidly established new populations in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, impacting local fish biodiversity. Here, we have developed a new, fast ({\textless} 35 min) molecular approach to detect and quantify P. miles environmental DNA (eDNA) in combination with a portable device for field-based analysis. Using a species-specific real-time colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qcLAMP) for the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene, we demonstrate a high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 0.002 ng DNA per reaction, equivalent to only 50 copies of the COI gene. The assay is specific to the target in the presence of closely related and co- occurring species, and it is quantitative over five orders of magnitude. We validated the assay using aquarium water samples and further demonstrated its utility on natural eDNA samples collected from locations around the island of Crete where P. miles had been sighted. P. miles was indeed detected in three out of nine locations, two nature reserves and a closed bay. Lack of detection in the remaining locations suggest that populations are still at a low density. We also demonstrate the feasibility of P. miles eDNA qualitative detection directly from the filter used to collect eDNA-containing particles, completely omitting DNA extraction. Overall, we present a new approach for fast and targeted eDNA quantification. The developed LAMP assay together with the quantitative real-time colorimetric detection approach open new possibilities for monitoring invasive P. miles in the field.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Managing invasive species with prevention and early-detection strategies can avert severe ecological and economic impacts. Horizon scanning, an evidence-based process combining risk screening and consensus building to identify threats, has become a valuable tool for prioritizing invasive species management and prevention. We assembled a working group of experts from academic, government, and nonprofit agencies and organizations, and conducted a multi-taxa horizon scan for Florida, USA, the first of its kind in North America. Our primary objectives were to identify high-risk species and their introduction pathways, to detail the magnitude and mechanism of potential impacts, and, more broadly, to demonstrate the utility of horizon scanning. As a means to facilitate future horizon scans, we document the process used to generate the list of taxa for screening. We evaluated 460 taxa for their potential to arrive, establish, and cause negative ecological and socioeconomic impacts, and identified 40 potential invaders, including alewife, zebra mussel, crab-eating macaque, and red swamp crayfish. Vertebrates and aquatic invertebrates posed the greatest invasion threat, over half of the high-risk taxa were omnivores, and there was high confidence in the scoring of high-risk taxa. Common arrival pathways were ballast water, biofouling of vessels, and escape from the pet/aquarium/horticulture trade. Competition, predation, and damage to agriculture/forestry/aquaculture were common impact mechanisms. We recommend full risk analysis for the high-risk taxa; increased surveillance at Florida's ports, state borders, and high-risk pathways; and periodic review and revision of the list. Few horizon scans detail the comprehensive methodology (including list-building), certainty estimates for all scoring categories and the final score, detailed pathways, and the magnitude and mechanism of impact. Providing this information can further inform prevention efforts and can be efficiently replicated in other regions. Moreover, harmonizing methodology can facilitate data sharing and enhance interpretation of results for stakeholders and the general public.},

However, the complexity of nervous tissues poses great challenges to 3D-printed bioengineered analogues, which should possess diverse architectural/chemical/electrical functionalities to resemble the native growth microenvironments for functional neural regeneration. In this work, we provide a state-of-the-art review of the latest development of 3D printing for bioengineered neural constructs. Various 3D printing techniques for neural tissue-engineered scaffolds or living cell-laden constructs are summarized and compared in terms of their unique advantages. We highlight the advanced strategies by integrating topographical, biochemical and electroactive cues inside 3D-printed neural constructs to replicate in vivo-like microenvironment for functional neural regeneration. The typical applications of 3D-printed bioengineered constructs for in vivo repair of injured nervous tissues, bio-electronics interfacing with native nervous system, neural-on-chips as well as brain-like tissue models are demonstrated. The challenges and future outlook associated with 3D printing for functional neural constructs in various categories are discussed.},

	abstract = {BackgroundAlthough freshwater ecosystems cover less than 1\% of the earth's surface, they support extremely high levels of biodiversity and provide vital ecosystem services. However, due to the introduction of non-native fishes, aquatic ecosystem functioning has been altered, and in some cases, declined sharply. Quantifying the impacts of invasive species has proven problematic. In this study, we examined the relative trophic position of native piscivorous fishes to estimate the effects of invasive Nile tilapia on food webs in the downstream sections of an invaded large subtropical river, the Pearl River, China. Furthermore, we quantified how native piscivorous fish diets changed as the Nile tilapia invasion progressed.ResultsThe trophic position of the widely distributed and locally important economically harvested piscivorous culter fish (Culterrecurviceps), mandarinfish (Sinipercakneri), and catfish (Pelteobagrusfulvidraco) lowered significantly in the invaded Dongjiang River compared to an uninvaded reference Beijiang River. The lower trophic position of these piscivorous fishes was reflected by a major reduction in the proportion of prey fish biomass in their diets following the Nile tilapia invasion. Small fishes in the diet of culter fish from the reference river (33\% small fishes, 17\% zooplankton) shifted to lower trophic level zooplankton prey in the invaded river (36\% zooplankton, 25\% small fish), possibly due to the presence of Nile tilapia. Additionally, small fishes in the diet of mandarinfish in the reference river (46\% small fishes, 11\% aquatic insects) declined in the invaded river (20\% aquatic insects, 30\% small fishes). Similarly, the diet of catfish from the reference river shifted from fish eggs (25\% fish eggs, 25\% aquatic insects) to aquatic insects in the invaded river (44\% aquatic insects, 5\% fish eggs).ConclusionsThe results of this study contributed to a growing body of evidence, suggesting that Nile tilapia can modify trophic interactions in invaded ecosystems. It is crucial to understand the processes outlined in this study in order to better assess non-native aquatic species, conserve the stability of freshwater ecosystems, and improve current conservation strategies in reaches of the Pearl River and other similar rivers that have experienced invasions of non-native species.},

	abstract = {The issue of biological invasions in aquatic ecosystems is becoming increasingly severe in the contemporary world. Due to the lack of monitoring and management systems for aquatic invasive species, the difficulty in identifying aquatic invasive species, and the limited effectiveness of conventional control methods in aquatic environments, biological control in water bodies is comparatively more challenging than other types of interventions. In recent years, environmental DNA (eDNA) survey methods have rapidly developed in various fields, such as biological monitoring, community ecology, paleoenvironmental research, conservation biology, and invasion ecology, due to their unique advantages of being rapid, sensitive, efficient, and non-invasive. Because of these characteristics, this innovative molecular approach has gained wider acceptance and is being increasingly utilized for the detection of biological diversity in aquatic environments. Furthermore, it has emerged as a novel technology to address the pressing and significant issue of aquatic invasive species in the vast freshwater and marine resources of the East Asian region. This paper summarizes a variety of literature sources to summarize the major aquatic invasive species in East Asian countries and the current application status of eDNA technology in their survey processes. Using China as a case study, it expounds on the prospective incorporation of the 4E strategy with eDNA technology for the surveillance of biological invasions. Furthermore, it explores the potential prospects of eDNA technology in species diversity management and policy formulation, offering theoretical guidance for establishing aquatic invasive species monitoring systems. From a technological standpoint, the integration of eDNA technology with the 4E strategy holds significant potential for application, thereby offering a promising reference for the formulation of policies related to the management of aquatic biological invasions and biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Invasive fish can profoundly affect communities they invade. In Hawai'i, invasive fishes have become established in many anchialine pools, threatening the persistence of resident invertebrates, including several endangered species. Tools to eradicate invasive fishes from these pools are lacking. This study tested the efficacy of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas diffused into anchialine pool water as a method to eradicate invasive Mozambique tilapia \{\vphantom{\}}Oreochromis mossambicus), guppies \{\vphantom{\}}Poecilia reticulata), and western mosquitofish \{\vphantom{\}}Gambusia affinis). We first conducted aquarium trials to identify how these fishes were affected by elevated CO2 and the concomitant reduction in pH. We then carried out field trials in pools containing these fish in one pool each at two national historical parks on the Island of Hawafi during July 2021-January 2022. We also developed environmental DNA (eDNA) protocols to detect fish that may have survived CO2 treatments. The effect of CO2 on fish behavior varied among species; at pH 5.3 (CO2 = 255 mg/L) for tilapia and 5.0 (CO2 = 488 mg/L) for tilapia, guppies, and mosquitofish, all generally lost their ability to swim, showed slow or no gill movement, and altered their position in the water column. No tilapia survived the trials (n = 4 and 6 individuals at pH 5.3 and 5.0, respectively). In contrast, 41.7\% (n = 12) of adult guppies and 66.7\% (n = 12) of adult mosquitofish survived treatment at pH 5.0. In the field we were unable to reduce anchialine pool water pH below 5.7. Regardless, we were able to eradicate tilapia from one pool over four sequential treatments. Post-treatment eDNA assessments supported visual surveys, confirming our results. We were not able to eradicate guppies and mosquitofish. Results from this study show that CO2 can be an effective tool for eradicating invasive tilapia from anchialine pools, and post-treatment eDNA assessments can provide managers with a method for evaluating the success of eradication efforts.},

	abstract = {The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) invaded the Great Lakes in the 1990s and the species continued expansion into inland bodies of water, raising basin wide concerns for negative ecological impacts. The Lower Fox River (LFR), Wisconsin, USA, is the state's largest tributary linking the Great Lakes to inland Lake Winnebago through a fragmented waterway of eight lock and dam structures across 62.0 river kilometers (RKm). Round goby were detected in the LFR lower river reaches, in the early 2000's below an invasive species barrier (completely sealed structure) located near the midpoint of the LFR (RKm 31.5), but in 2015, the species was observed above the barrier raising concerns for upstream invasion. This discovery prompted the closure of the upper most navigational lock system (Menasha Lock, RKm 62.0) separating the outflow of Lake Winnebago to the LFR. The goal of this study was to assess the distribution and abundance of round goby throughout the entire LFR in 2019-2021 using baited minnow traps. We further evaluate differences in capture rates between combinations of minnow trap styles, bait types, and bait quantities. A total of 1,007 round goby were captured during monitoring surveys throughout the LFR (2019-2021), confirming presence in all river segments with maximum upstream extent reaching Menasha Lock. Highest densities of round goby are found below the invasive species barrier (RKm 31.5), but males and females are present at the current maximum upstream distribution. An additional 834 round goby were captured during the comparison of trapping strategies and suggest round-style minnow traps baited with food (i.e., dog food or hotdog) are successful in capturing round goby and outperform other trap/bait types. Continued monitoring would help describe trends in abundance and adaptive sampling approaches will improve detection.},

	abstract = {Callinina georgiana (banded mystery snail) and Cipangopaludina japonica (Japanese mystery snail) are two exotic viviparid snail species that have been introduced to North America. These snail species harbor parasites, predate on the eggs of native fish fauna and are prolific in their ability to spread across various freshwater environments. While several recent studies have explored the population structure and range expansion of the species in the United States, none have formally addressed control or eradication strategies. In this study, we attempted to do this by carrying out a series of assays to determine the efficacy of the popular molluscicide, niclosamide monohydrate against both species under both acute and chronic exposure. Our results show that the lethal dose required to achieve 50 \% mortality (LD50) for C. georgiana and C. japonica was 1.509 mg/L and 1.296 mg/L respectively. In acute exposure experiments we observed that at higher concentrations, all C. georgiana specimens in experimental treatment tanks were dead but C. japonica never reached 100\% mortality even at the highest concentration. In chronic exposure experiments, C. georgiana did not survive more than a week while C. japonica did not survive more than 11 days in the experimental tanks. We conclude that niclosamide is an effective chemical control agent for eradication of invasive mystery snails in North America. However, further studies exploring the effect of the molluscide on non-target species, especially local native fauna, should be investigated prior to any scaled up field applications.},

	abstract = {A bench-scale dose-response study evaluated the efficacy of a commercially available copper-based molluscicide known as EarthTec QZ for controlling quagga veligers collected from three Southern California sites impacted by quagga mussels. A variety of concentrations were tested (0, 3, 16.7, 33.4, and 50.1 pL/L of EarthTec QZ or 0, 0.18, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 mg/L as copper (Cu), respectively) for different durations (0.5, 2, 5, and 24 hours) on quagga mussel veligers. Water from each study site was also used in non-target 96-hour acute toxicity testing of three other species. A suite of water quality parameters was measured to characterize the differences between the study sites. The federal and California secondary maximum contaminant level and action level for copper in drinking water are 1.0 and 1.3 mg/L as Cu, respectively; therefore, results for the 16.7 pL/L EarthTec QZ (1.0 mg/L as Cu) test condition were the main reference point for assessing the efficacy of EarthTec QZ as a feasible treatment strategy. Under this condition, veliger mortality at two study sites, Lake Mathews, and a downstream water treatment plant, was found to be greater than 60\% and 85\% after 5 hours, and 95\% and 100\% after 24 hours, respectively. Lower efficacy was observed for the Lake Piru study site, with approximately 30\% veliger mortality after 24 hours. Alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon, and chemical oxygen demand were found to be significant variables for veliger mortality in these hard water locations based on linear regression modeling. The three non-target indicator species were adversely affected by EarthTec QZ at concentrations tested. These results indicate that this product has potential as an effective chemical control agent against quagga veligers at low doses, but the aforementioned water quality parameters must be considered with full-scale application to optimize target efficacy, while minimizing exposure to non-target species and costs.},

In this study, we investigated whether the abundance of Venus clam (Gafrarium tumidum Röding, 1798) influences sediment accretion in the sandy intertidal area of Pari Island, Indonesia. We created 18 plots consisting of nine defaunated and nine non-defaunated treatment plots. On each plot, 111-559 clams were deployed, and four pieces of one-inch PVC were planted randomly to see sediment elevation. Sediment accretion was measured by sediment elevation. Observations were carried out for seven months. At the end of the observations, clam abundances were 0-64 ind/m2 in the defaunated plots and 0-47 ind/m2 in the non-defaunated plots. The average sediment accretion in the defaunated plots was 0.98-3.3 cm, while in the non-defaunated plots was 1.95-4.43 cm. This study showed that the clam had no significant effect (p-value {\textgreater} 0.05) on sediment accretion in both plots as its abundance was insufficient to alter sediment. The sediment accretion occurred not caused by clam but by others such as sipuncula and physical oceanography factors in the research location.},

The results showed that the Ea of juvenile yellowfin tuna muscles in response to high temperature (34°C) was significantly lower than that of the control (28°C), and it also increased ETS. At 6 h, CEA decreased slightly in the high-temperature group, but, the difference in CEA between 24 h and 0 h decreased. After heat stress for 6 h, the activities of acid phosphatase (ACP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (AST) increased, indicating that the metabolic rate was accelerated. After heat stress for 24 h, the activity of ALT decreased, indicating that with time elapsed, the activities of some protein metabolizing enzymes increased, and some decreased. In this study, digestive enzymes, trypsin and lipase increased gradually. After heat stress, Ea and Ec change significantly. Yellowfin tuna muscles use lipids in response to sharp temperature increases at high temperatures, red muscles respond to temperature changes by increasing energy in the early stages, but not nearly as much, and white muscles reduce lipids.},

Their quality was ascertained using various metrics. Masking of repetitive elements, gene prediction and functional annotation was performed.ResultsSequence analysis revealed a very high presence of repetitive DNA and, among others, thermal adaptation genes and insecticide-resistance genes. Through the RNAseq analysis of larvae and adults of Ae. koreicus and Ae. japonicus exposed to different temperatures we also identified genes showing a differential temperature-dependent activation.ConclusionsThe assembly of Akor1 and Ajap1 genomes constitutes the first updated collective knowledge of the genomes of both mosquito species, providing the possibility of understanding key mechanisms of their biology such as the ability to adapt to harsh climates and to develop insecticide-resistance mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) is becoming integrated as an established biomonitoring tool, often characterized by detection limits exceeding those of conventional counterparts. However, further improving the sensitivity of these methods may be invaluable for the early detection of invasive species, or for locating remnant populations of endangered species, and the adequate quantification of their abundances. In this study, we provide empirical evidence showing that the implementation of multiple genetic markers targeting different loci is a surprisingly overlooked strategy to increase the sensitivity of single-species detections and quantification of their abundance, particularly at the lower end of the species abundance range. We analyzed 45 natural eDNA samples obtained from a wide range of water bodies in Belgium, in which either the invasive American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) or the rare European weather loach (Misgurnus fossilis) occurred under variable abundances, and compared detection success and precision of quantification of simplex (single locus) versus multiplex (multilocus) droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analyses. Multiplexing different primer/probe assays targeting independent loci resulted in a significantly enhanced detection probability compared to the simplex analyses, gaining a twofold reduction in the limit of detection (LOD). Also the precision of eDNA quantification significantly improved in multiplex reactions, especially in low concentration samples. This was reflected in a significant reduction in the coefficient of variation (CV) among technical replicates, resulting in an associated decrease of the limit of quantification (LOQ). We conclude that the use of multiple markers can significantly improve the analytical sensitivity of eDNA-based single-species detections and precision of absolute abundance quantifications.},

	abstract = {Although wading anglers represent a known risk for the spread of Aquatic Invasive Species (AIS), minimal research has investigated prevention messaging targeted at this demographic. We applied the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) of persuasion to this context and tested whether messaging that emphasized threat, efficacy, or both threat and efficacy was more effective in persuading wading anglers to implement preventive behaviors. We found support for the EPPM, but for a single exposure to the tested AIS messages, we found no effects of type of message. Pre-message attitudes toward AIS were a better predictor of intended behavior than our messages, indicating a ceiling effect. Highlighting the effectiveness of preventive behaviors (response efficacy) was related to more reactance toward the message. Our findings suggest that messaging may be more effective if it acknowledges wading anglers' experience and awareness of AIS threats while providing straightforward self-efficacy information. Messaging should emphasize the actions wading anglers can perform that reduce AIS introduction risk.},

The workshop focus was on developing research priorities for the thematic areas that are addressed in QZAP 2.0: 1) early detection monitoring, 2) prevention and containment, 3) control and management, and 4) rapid response. In addition, research priorities were developed for a fifth thematic area that addressed dreissenid mussel biology. Forty scientists participated in the two-day workshop. Prior to the workshop, participants were asked to review and rank research priorities that were established for a previous version of the QZAP and to offer suggestions on emerging research priorities. During the workshop, subject matter experts presented information describing current knowledge of research and information associated with the thematic areas of early detection monitoring, prevention and containment, rapid response, control and management, and biology in the context of strategies and actions listed in QZAP 2.0. The rankings of previous research priorities and suggestions of emerging priorities were then reviewed, and a revised list of research priorities was formed. The list of research priorities is presented by thematic area.},

The results showed that the GSH levels were decreased but the TBARS levels were increased in all the exposure groups after 24 and 96 h compared to the control. It was observed that SOD activity decreased but CAT activity increased in all the DI exposure groups after 24 h compared to the control. At the end of 96 hours, it was observed that CAT and SOD activities increased again in some exposure groups compared to the control. Exposure time also had an effect on biomarkers in different levels. According to the results, the cytotoxicity of DI and MA combination depended on their concentrations. DI or/ and MA, in sub-lethal concentrations, induced oxidative damages in D. polymorpha. Combined exposure of the pesticides can alter their toxicity and may be evidence of increased toxicity and oxidative stress.},

While M. polykrikoides has caused significant die offs of bivalves and other marine organisms, the Northern quahog or hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, is comparatively more resistant to this HAB. This study quantified clearance rates of juvenile hard clams (10-20 mm) exposed to three different North American populations of M. polykrikoides (bloom, strain CP1, strain CPSB-1G) as well as the nonharmful cryptophyte, Rhodomonas salina and the nonharmful dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium aureolum, in single and mixed algal exposures. Multiple biovolume exposures with M. polykrikoides bloom water and R. salina (1,000, 1,500, 3,000 cells mL -1 M. polykrikoides biovolume equivalent) were completed to assess the effects of increasing biomass on hard clam clearance rates and selection. Hard clams opened and actively cleared algal mixtures at and below 1,000 M. polykrikoides cells mL -1 . During single species exposures, strain CPSB-1G and R. salina were cleared significantly faster than wild M. polykrikoides populations and strain CP1. During mixed exposures, R. salina was cleared significantly faster than CPSB-1G but not other M. polykrikoides populations and there was no difference between hard clam clearance rates of G. aureolum and R. salina. Clearance rates of M. polykrikoides at {\textgreater}1,500 cells mL -1 M. polykrikoides/R. salina mixtures were not significantly different than zero unlike clearance of those at  1,000 cells mL -1 ) bloom densities. Given this, and the documented survival of hard clams during blooms, M. mercenaria may be candidate for aquaculture and restoration in regions prone to HABs caused by M. polykrikoides.},

The evidence-based policy (EBP) approach has been promoted on the grounds that it provides greater transparency and consistency by relying on 'high quality' information. However, EBP also creates epistemic responsibilities. Decision-making where limited or no empirical evidence exists, such as is often the case in marine systems, creates epistemic obligations for new information acquisition. We argue that philosophical approaches can inform the sciencepolicy interface. Using marine biosecurity examples, we specifically examine the epistemic challenges in the acquisition and acceptance of evidence to inform policy, discussing epistemic due care and biases in consideration of evidence.},

	abstract = {Temperature is an important environmental factor affecting metabolism, growth and life activities of marine bivalves. To reveal the molecular and metabolic responses to heat stress, comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics were performed in the commercially important bivalve, Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. Comparative transcriptomics revealed a total of 3980 differential genes (DEGs) mainly involved in energy metabolism, protein processing, glycerolphospholipid metabolism, inoxidizability and anti-apoptosis. Comparative metabolomic analysis identified 293 differential metabolites (DEMs) in the heat-stressed clams, including Acetyl-CoA, Beta-D-Glucose, phosphatidylcholine and free amino acids. For the heat-stress clams, they showed the significantly increased enzyme activities of AKP and ACP, as well as antioxidant-related enzyme activities (SOD and CAT) and oxidative damage substance (MDA). The changes in gene expression of glycolysisrelated genes (GLUT1, GLK, HK1 and GPI6) and metabolites (Beta-D-Glucose and Acetyl-CoA) reflect the adjusted energy metabolism in the heat-stressed clams. The protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum may play the important roles in the stability of cell membrane structure during heat adaptation. The increased contents of glycerophospholipid (PC) may be essential to maintain the stability and permeability of cell membrane in the heat-stressed clams. Molecular chaperones (HSP70 and HSP90) may participate in the degradation of misfolded proteins to maintain cell homeostasis during the heat stress. To defense the heat stress, clams also initiate the protection and defense This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article mechanisms by activating antioxidant system, innate immune system and anti-apoptotic system.

Malacoherpesvirus-like sequences were also detected through genome sequencing projects in amphioxus (Branchiostoma species) and annelid worm (Capitella teleta), suggesting the existence of a hidden diversity of malacoherpesviruses in aquatic animals. Here, to extend the knowledge on malacoherpesvirus diversity, we searched for the presence of malacoherpesvirus relatives in genomic, transcriptomic and metagenomic datasets, including from the Tara Oceans expedition, and report 4 novel malacoherpesvirus-like genomes (MalacoHV1-4). Genomic analysis suggested gastropods and bivalves as the most probable hosts for these new malacoherpesviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the family B DNA polymerase placed the novel MalacoHV1 and MalacoHV3 as sister lineages of OsHV-1 and HaHV-1, respectively, whereas MalacoHV2 and MalacoHV4 showed higher divergence. The viral genome found associated with amphioxus together with MalacoHV4 formed a sister clade to the mollusc and annelid malacoherpesviruses, suggesting an early divergence of the two virus assemblages. In conclusion, although relatively rare in the available sequence databases, the previously undescribed malacoherpesviruses, MalacoHV1-4, circulate in aquatic ecosystems and should be considered as possible emerging viruses under changing environmental conditions.},

Baseline and updated survey data are needed to understand the abundance, distribution and rate of spread of non-native species within marinas over time in order to support management strategies, develop applicable biosecurity measures and inform rapid response plans. Rapid assessment surveys (RAS) were employed to survey floating pontoons, as well as opportunistically survey intertidal structures, for non-native biofouling species in 22 marinas across the Republic of Ireland. A total of 25 non-native species were recorded: 19 invertebrates and 6 macroalgae, with ascidians being the most represented group. Four non-native species not previously reported in published literature from the Republic of Ireland were recorded: devil's tongue weed, Grateloupia turuturu Yamada, 1941, the compass sea squirt, Asterocarpa humilis (Heller, 1878), the San Diego sea squirt, Botrylloides diegensis Ritter \& Forsyth, 1917 and the branching bryozoan, Bugulina simplex (Hincks, 1886).

Survivorship and distribution of zebra mussels within a waterbody are thought to be influenced by temperature and dissolved oxygen conditions, but detailed information to confirm the importance of these environmental controls is necessary to inform management efforts. We measured planktonic zebra mussel veliger density and adult survivorship in San Justo Reservoir in central California to determine distribution and timing of spawning in relation to temperature and dissolved oxygen throughout winter, spring, and summer. We found seasonal patterns in adult survivorship, with high mortality late in the summer and higher than expected survivorship during the spring when dissolved oxygen concentrations were approximately 1 mg/L. Veliger abundance peaked several meters above the thermocline from June to August. Dissolved oxygen concentrations limited veliger distribution, with few to no veligers collected in the anoxic hypolimnion. Veliger settlement out of the water column appears to be possible in San Justo Reservoir at any time of year. A better understanding of how veligers, juveniles, and adult mussels respond to fluctuating dissolved oxygen and temperature conditions will further knowledge of timing and duration of water drawdowns or other control methods for managing this harmful invasive species.},

Paradoxically, the extensive fieldwork undertaken by these institutions and their partners may result in the inadvertent movement and spread of invasive species within and between sensitive ecosystems. In this work, we consider the potential effects of internal guidelines and policies designed to prevent the spread of invasive species by the field activities of management institutions and their partners. Such policies could be high-leverage tools for invasive species prevention, however, as large, complex organizations seek to implement policies to limit the spread of invasive species, it may be challenging to accommodate the wide diversity of potential invasion pathways and mitigation efforts facilitated via the programs, activities, and ecosystems they manage. Prevention policies may also be met with resistance due to the costs of implementation unless concrete benefits can be demonstrated. Assessing and communicating the effects of prevention policies could motivate improved implementation and adherence by institutional units and partners and could help inform adaptive policy changes. However, assessing the effectiveness of invasive species prevention presents a unique set of challenges, including incomplete data on invasive species distribution and pathways, that make it difficult to measure the effects of prevention efforts. In this work, we present a conceptual framework for evaluating institutional policies for invasive species prevention. We describe a flexible, multifaceted approach that considers policy implementation and adherence as well as ecological outcomes. We discuss potential application of this framework using a policy recently implemented by the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by service personnel and partners during field activities as a case study.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0287582},
	abstract = {Background 
The environmental prevalence of widely prescribed human pharmaceuticals that target key evolutionary conserved biomolecules present across phyla is concerning. Antidepressants, one of the most widely consumed pharmaceuticals globally, have been developed to target biomolecules modulating monoaminergic neurotransmission, thus interfering with the endogenous regulation of multiple key neurophysiological processes. Furthermore, rising prescription and consumption rates of antidepressants caused by the burgeoning incidence of depression is consistent with increasing reports of antidepressant detection in aquatic environments worldwide. Consequently, there are growing concerns that long-term exposure to environmental levels of antidepressants may cause adverse drug target-specific effects on non-target aquatic organisms. While these concerns have resulted in a considerable body of research addressing a range of toxicological endpoints, drug target-specific effects of environmental levels of different classes of antidepressants in non-target aquatic organisms remain to be understood. Interestingly, evidence suggests that molluscs may be more vulnerable to the effects of antidepressants than any other animal phylum, making them invaluable in understanding the effects of antidepressants on wildlife. Here, a protocol for the systematic review of literature to understand drug target-specific effects of environmental levels of different classes of antidepressants on aquatic molluscs is described. The study will provide critical insight needed to understand and characterize effects of antidepressants relevant to regulatory risk assessment decision-making, and/or direct future research efforts.
Methods
The systematic review will be conducted in line with the guidelines by the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE). A literature search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, as well as grey literature databases, will be carried out. Using predefined criteria, study selection, critical appraisal and data extraction will be done by multiple reviewers with a web-based evidence synthesis platform. A narrative synthesis of outcomes of selected studies will be presented. The protocol has been registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) registry with the registration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/P4H8W.},

In this study, we observed the microscopic morphology of abalone abdominal foot surface, and found that the surface was covered with a large number of fibers. Then five types of force measuring plates were designed and processed for the adhesion test of abalone abdominal foot. According to the test results, the composition of abalone abdominal foot adhesion force was analyzed and the proportion of various adhesion force to the total adhesion force of abalone abdominal foot was calculated. Among them, the vacuum adhesion force accounts for more than half of the total adhesion force of abalone abdominal foot, and its proportion is more than 60\%. Van der Waals force also plays an important role, and its proportion is more than 20\%. The proportion of capillary force is very small, which is only about 1\%. Its main role is to form a liquid film to prevent the gas from flowing into the sucker. The vacuum adhesion of abalone abdominal foot can be further divided into the whole adhesion of abdominal foot, the local adhesion of abdominal foot and the frictional equivalent vacuum adhesion. And the whole adhesion of abdominal foot is basically equivalent to the local adhesion of abdominal foot. This study quantifies the proportion of various adhesion forces to the total adhesion force of the abdominal foot, which provides a reference for the further study of other adhesive creatures and the design of bionic underwater adhesion devices.},

	abstract = {We combine historical and recent monitoring data with modeling to get a better insight into water quality development of the large Oder/Szczecin Lagoon and especially the role of macrophytes. Data indicates that the system is eutrophic for centuries and a naturally eutrophic system. During the last decades, external nutrient loads decreased but keep the system in a eutrophic state. The systems primary production is limited by light and nitrogen and cannot be sufficiently managed by external nutrient load reductions. We consider 36\% macrophyte coverage of the lagoon area as potential historical maximum. Despite its shallowness the lagoon was never a macrophyte dominated, clear water system. About 31\% of the lagoon area would be covered by macrophytes in a good ecological status according to the Water Framework Directive. However, the existing water transparency targets seem too ambitious and not realistic. Changes in macrophyte coverage on water quality are restricted to near shore areas and hardly affect the open lagoon. Existing models require an improved representation of water transparency and effects on macrophyte colonization depth. Presently the patchy macrophyte coverage is only about 12\% of the lagoon area. This low coverage and a relatively poor species composition results in a non-satisfactory state classification. However, ecologically valuable angiosperms and charophytes seem to recover. A strict avoidance of mechanical disturbances could be a measure to support macrophyte re-colonization. A systematic improvement of piscivorous fish stocks may be a supporting measure to reduce eutrophication. Restoration perspectives and consequences for environmental policies are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper, I selected Sinonovacula constricta, a typical representative of commercial bivalve shellfishes from Zhangzhou city, and found that microplastics were detected in all the samples with small size. The abundance in farm samples (3.65 n/g) was higher than in market (0.89 n/g), despite their smaller weight, which were mainly contributed by body fluid. Microplastics transported from the body fluid to the viscera and then metabolized into muscle were substantially reduced (69.3\%), only 0 or 1 microplastics observed in the muscles on the micron scale. The microplastics detected in the market samples were mainly concentrated in the viscera, accounting for 81\%, while distributed in all the organs of farm samples, with body fluids the most accounting for 52\%. A total of four shapes were detected, with the highest percentage of fibrous shape, while foam-like microplastics were not detected in the market samples. The abundance was not correlated with sample weight, but market samples showed positive correlation. A total of seven polymers were detected, with the highest rate of PP (27\%). The polymer risk level reached level III. The percentage of PVC in the market samples exceeded that of farms, which resulted in a higher hazard risk index despite their lower abundance. The cleaning process and excretory behavior, from farm to market seafood pond, greatly reduced microplastic contamination and the risk. This paper can provide some baseline for the study of microplastic characteristics of bivalve shellfish, and decision making on plastic management from aquaculture farm to market, especially for seafood security.},

In traditional approaches, it is considered that the extinction of species with high centrality poses the greatest threat to secondary extinction. However, the indirect effect, which is equally important as the local and direct effects, is not included. Here, we propose an optimized disintegration strategy model for quantitative food webs and introduced tabu search, a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, to identify keystone species. Topological simulations are used to record secondary extinctions during species removal and secondary extinction areas, as well as to evaluate food web robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is also validated by comparing it with traditional methods. Results of our experiments demonstrate that our strategy can optimize the effect of food web disintegration and identify the species whose extinction is most destructive to the food web through global search. The algorithm provides an innovative and efficient way for further development of keystone species identification in the ecosystem.},

Here we report the first record of Sinanodonta lauta (Martens, 1877) from Iran and provide morphological and molecular data on this alien population. This species was observed in the Dez River and a fish farm in Khuzestan, south of Iran. The S. lauta introduction seems to be closely related to the introduction of Asian carps from East Asia. The individuals collected from the river exhibited two COI haplotypes, probably due to several introduction events of host fish. Based on our haplotype network, the alien individuals found in Iran is closer to the native ones from South Korea (two-three substitutions) compared to other native individuals reported from Japan and Russian Far East. The presence of 10-11 years old specimens in Dez River shows that the species can survive well in the natural environment of southern Iran. Further expansion and colonization of S. lauta in south Iran or beyond it are not unexpected due to some human-mediated dispersal events as well as waterways in the region.},

To assist enforcement agencies in identifying species either intentionally (trafficked) or unintentionally (stowaway) entrained in the trade-chain pathway, rapid forensic techniques are needed to enable their detection from DNA samples when physical identification is not possible. Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) is an emerging technique, with recent applications in biosecurity and forensic sciences, which has potential to function as a field-based detection tool. Here we provide an overview of current research that applies LAMP to environmental biosecurity, including identification of ornamental wildlife parts, consumer products, and invasive species monitoring and biosecurity detection. We discuss the current scope of LAMP as applied to various wildlife trade scenarios and biosecurity checkpoint monitoring, highlight the specificity, sensitivity, and robustness for these applications, and review the potential utility of LAMP for rapid field-based detection at biosecurity checkpoints. Based on our assessment of the literature we recommend broader interest, research uptake, and investment in LAMP as an appropriate field-based species detection method for a wide range of environmental biosecurity scenarios.},

	abstract = {Northern Eurasia is extensive and includes terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that cover several natural zones and access to the seas of three oceans. As a result, it has been invaded by numerous invasive alien species (IAS) over large temporal and spatial scales. The purpose of this research was to assess invasion trends and construct species distribution models for the Russian TOP-100 most dangerous IAS. Environmentally suitable regions for IAS were established based on alien species attribute databases, datasets of 169,709 species occurrence records (SOR) and raster layers of environmental variables using species distribution modelling (MaxEnt). The objectives of this research were to (1) create databases of SOR for the TOP-100 IAS in Russia; 2) determine pathways, residence time, donor regions and trends of invasions; (3) determine the main types of spatial distributions of invasive species and their relation to residence time; and (4) distinguish regions with the highest richness of IAS that have a strong impact on the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of Russia. We found that although species invasions date back over 400 years, the number of naturalized IAS has increased non-linearly over the past 76 years. The TOP-100 list is mainly represented by unintentionally introduced species (62\%) which are characterized by different introduction pathways. Species occurrence records revealed that 56 IAS are distributed locally, 26 are distributed regionally and 18 are widespread in Russia. Species with local, regional or widespread distributions were characterized by residence times of 55, 126 or 190 years, respectively. We found that IAS with local distribution can expand their range into suitable regions more extensively (expected increase by 32\%) than widespread species (expected increase by only 7\%). The procedure of identifying hot/cold spots locations based on SOR allowed us to identify the Russian regions with the highest richness of IAS. Our results and the integrated database that we created provide a framework for studying IAS over large temporal and spatial scales that can be used in the development of management plans for dangerous IAS.},

In temperate lakes, fishes with different thermal optima can become spatially segregated during summer stratification. This habitat partitioning, or niche complementarity, may play a role in the coexistence of trophically similar species; however, the extent of partitioning is dependent on the resources available within each habitat. Although habitat partitioning of fish thermal guilds has been studied in individual lakes, broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap and segregation are not yet understood. In this study, we explore the patterns and drivers of spatial overlap among thermal guilds (cold-, cool-, and warm-water) at a broad scale.LocationOntario, Canada.MethodsWe built a multivariate regression tree to explore patterns and environmental drivers of spatial overlap in freshwater fishes across three thermal guilds from 438 lakes.ResultsWe identified five clusters of lakes exhibiting different patterns of spatial overlap among the three thermal guilds. Temperature (growing degree days) and maximum lake depth were strong drivers of the spatial overlap patterns.Main ConclusionsThese findings provide a better understanding of broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap and allow us to predict how spatial overlap, and ultimately species interactions and competition, may change under a warming climate.},

	abstract = {Non-native species have the potential to cause ecological and economic harm to coastal and estuarine ecosystems. Understanding which habitat types are most vulnerable to biological invasions, where invasions originate, and the vectors by which they arrive can help direct limited resources to prevent or mitigate ecological and socio-economic harm. Information about the occurrence of non-native species can help guide interventions at all stages of invasion, from first introduction, to naturalization and invasion. However, monitoring at relevant scales requires considerable investment of time, resources, and taxonomic expertise. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding methods sample coastal ecosystems at broad spatial and temporal scales to augment established monitoring methods. We use COI mtDNA eDNA sampling to survey a diverse assemblage of species across distinct habitats in the Salish Sea in Washington State, USA, and classify each as non-native, native, or indeterminate in origin. The non-native species detected include both well-documented invaders and species not previously reported within the Salish Sea. We find a non-native assemblage dominated by shellfish and algae with native ranges in the temperate western Pacific, and find more-retentive estuarine habitats to be invaded at far higher levels than better-flushed rocky shores. Furthermore, we find an increase in invasion level with higher water temperatures in spring and summer across habitat types. This analysis contributes to a growing understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors that influence invasion level, and underscores the utility of eDNA surveys to monitor biological invasions and to better understand the factors that drive these invasions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Much like the response to naturally occurring physical, chemical, and biological variables controlling phytoplankton dynamics, anthropogenic modification to those variables may have profound implications on phytoplankton density and community structure in aquatic systems. We theorized that extensive land use and river channel modifications would result in (1) an increase in basin-wide phytoplankton density in the Middle Missouri River Basin (MMRB), and (2) a shift in community structure within and downstream of reservoirs filled after 1950 by examining data collected from 2020 and 2021 across the Middle Missouri River Basin to data collected in 1950. Our results suggest that system-wide increases in algal cell density were uncommon, yet variable with only two systems showing increases with high confidence and one showing a decrease. Some systems like the Missouri River reservoir sites and the James River showed an interannual shift in dominant phytoplankton genera, while other systems shared at least one dominant genus in 1950, 2020, and 2021. Our results suggest that despite modifications to land and water use, changes in phytoplankton density and community structure are clear but not consistent across the MMRB. Chlorophyll has been used extensively in ecological monitoring as a proxy for phytoplankton density or biovolume due to the relative simplicity of processing samples. We regressed the predictor variable of total chlorophyll and response variable of algal cell density as well as the predictor variable of log10 transformed Secchi depth (Secchi) and the response variables of either total chlorophyll or algal cell density from 161 samples across nine rivers of the MMRB. A positive relationship was observed between chlorophyll and algal cell density, while an inverse relationship was observed between Secchi and either chlorophyll or algal cell density. These findings suggest that using chlorophyll as a proxy for algal cell enumeration may provide an option to monitor phytoplankton dynamics in rivers. High suspended sediment loads may have confounded the relationship between Secchi and either chlorophyll or algal cell density. Chlorophyll determined by in vivo fluorescence provides a good proxy to rapidly monitor phytoplankton dynamics in lowland rivers.},

The study represents the first comprehensive research of the distribution of U. crassus in Serbian waters. The research covered a variety of waterbody types throughout Serbia, and distribution data were considered over three time periods from 1953 to 2019. The paper summarizes all the available literature data, field research and information obtained during the review of the collection of malacological material of the Natural History Museum in Belgrade. The results show a positive population trend, which is reflected in an extension of the distribution area and an increase in population density. After reviewing the museum collection, 13 synonyms for U. crassus were identified. The study also revealed a better insight into the habitat requirements and the limiting factors of the species. Substrate characteristics, waterbody types, altitude, and nitrate content of the water seem to be of great importance for the occurrence of the species. The results presented here can improve further measures for the conservation of U. crassus, not only in Serbia, but also in the Western Balkans.},

With trade by sea increasing due to globalization, the need for the improvement and development of seaports cannot be overlooked. While the development of ports is considered essential for the economic growth and prosperity of a nation, they also result in environmental deterioration that can hurt the future of humanity. The factors that cause such deterioration are many and have been discussed and studied in some detail over the years. Of these, however, studies associated with the environmental impacts of seaports emanating from the oceanfront are limited. It is with this understanding that the current work discusses the physical and biological impacts that occur due to the oceanic environment in seaports, the existing policy provisions, and the possible ways ahead to reduce environmental deterioration and allow their sustainable operation, by means of reviewing published works.},

	abstract = {BackgroundRecently, two invasive Aedes mosquito species, Ae. japonicus and Ae. koreicus, are circulating in several European countries posing potential health risks to humans and animals. Vector control is the main option to prevent mosquito-borne diseases, and an accurate genome sequence of these mosquitoes is essential to better understand their biology and to develop effective control strategies.MethodsA de novo genome assembly of Ae. japonicus (Ajap1) and Ae. koreicus (Akor1) has been produced based on a hybrid approach that combines Oxford Nanopore long-read and Illumina short-read data. Their quality was ascertained using various metrics. Masking of repetitive elements, gene prediction and functional annotation was performed.ResultsSequence analysis revealed a very high presence of repetitive DNA and, among others, thermal adaptation genes and insecticide-resistance genes. Through the RNA-seq analysis of larvae and adults of Ae. koreicus and Ae. japonicus exposed to different temperatures, we also identified genes showing a differential temperature-dependent activation.ConclusionsThe assembly of Akor1 and Ajap1 genomes constitutes the first updated collective knowledge of the genomes of both mosquito species, providing the possibility of understanding key mechanisms of their biology such as the ability to adapt to harsh climates and to develop insecticide-resistance mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Ballast water is recognised as successfully transporting non-native (potentially) invasive alien species and other harmful organisms (human pathogens and toxic phytoplankton) from one region to another. Global warming enables the successful adaptation of non-native species in new areas. The early detection of harmful species increases the likelihood that the response will be effective and cause less damage to biodiversity, ecosystems, economies and human health. Scientific evidence strongly points to the importance of prevention. In this context, this refers to continuous port monitoring, carried out with the aim of detecting harmful species soon after their introduction. The objectives of rapid detection are (a) early warning and prevention of further spread of harmful species through ballast water or natural circulation, and (b) a timely response through eradication or other appropriate strategies to reduce the number or spatial extent of introduced species. This paper provides guidance for the development of ballast water management in ports based on a literature review. Available and new methods for identifying marine species and best practises in port monitoring for the early detection of harmful species, as well as early warning and response measures following the introduction of species in ports, are presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {One of the most important causes of biodiversity loss are non-indigenous species (NIS), in particular invasive ones. The dispersion of NIS mainly depends on anthropogenic activities such as maritime traffic, which account for almost half of the total NIS introduction in the European seas, as reported by the European Environmental Agency. For this reason, NIS management measures are mainly focused on commercial ports (i.e., ballast water management and Marine Strategy Framework Directive monitoring), underestimating the role of marinas and tourist harbors; these host small vessels ({\textless}20 m), such as recreational, fishery, and sail ones without ballast waters, but are also responsible for NIS arrival and spread through the bilge water as well as from hull fouling. With the aim of paying attention to marinas and tourist harbors and validating an innovative molecular methodology for NIS surveillance and monitoring, in the present work, eDNA metabarcoding of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) was applied to both bilge waters and adjacent ones to assess species composition and particularly NIS presence. A total of 140 OTUs/species with extra-Mediterranean distribution were found in the bilge samples; several of these are most likely ascribed to food contamination (e.g., Salmo salar). Excluding food contamination species, twelve of these found in the bilge waters were already known as NIS in the Mediterranean Sea, belonging to algae, mollusks, crustaceans, annelids, echinoderms, and fishes. Nine of these species are new to Italian waters. The results obtained in the present work support the importance of NIS monitoring in marinas and small harbors, particularly in the bilge waters, through eDNA metabarcoding, having detected several potential NIS that otherwise would not have been discovered.},

	abstract = {The zooplankton community of Lake Champlain has been altered over the past decade due to the introduction of two predatory zooplankton species. Bythotrephes longimanus Leydig, 1860 was first detected in Lake Champlain in August 2014, and Cercopagis pengoi (Ostroumov, 1891) was detected in August 2018. Monitoring for both invasive species at 15 lake sites using whole water tow sampling has been ongoing since 2010 with no detection of either species until 2014. Utilizing data from the Lake Champlain long-term monitoring program, we assessed pre- and post-invasion population dynamics of both invasive species on the native zooplankton community. Our results showed shifts in community structure following invasion, including a reduction in Diacyclops thomasi (Forbes, 1882) populations by both invaders and a reduction in Daphnia retrocurva Forbes, 1882 following the introduction of B. longimanus. Other cyclopoids, bosminids, and rotifers were also reduced, corresponding to both introduced species. The native large-bodied plankton predator Leptodora kindtii (Focke, 1844) appears to be unable to coexist with either invasive predatory cladoceran, displaying seasonal partitioning between L. kindtii and the Cercopagidae. These findings suggest that the invasion of both large predators in Lake Champlain have impacted pelagic zooplankton community structure.},

Although trait-based analysis for mussels has increased, only a small proportion of traits reflecting mussel diversity in this region has been collated. Decentralized and non-standardized trait information impedes large-scale analysis. Assembling trait data in a synthetic dataset enables comparison across species and lineages and identification of data gaps. We collated data from the primary literature, books, state and federal reports, theses and dissertations, and museum collections into a centralized dataset covering information on taxonomy, morphology, reproductive ecology and life history, fish hosts, habitats, thermal tolerance, geographic distribution, available genetic information, and conservation status.

However, its metabolome remains poorly understood, particularly in light of the potential molecular sexual dimorphism between its different tissues. From an ecotoxicological point of view, inter-sex and inter-organ differences in the metabolome suggest variability in responsiveness, which can influence the analysis and interpretation of data, particularly in the case where males and females would be analyzed indifferently. This study aimed to assess the extent to which the molecular fingerprints of functionally diverse tissues like the digestive glands, gonads, gills, and mantle of D. polymorpha can reveal tissue-specific molecular sexual dimorphism. We employed a non-targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry and revealed a significant sexual molecular dimorphism in the gonads, and to a lesser extent in the digestive glands, of D. polymorpha. Our results highlight the critical need to consider inter-sex differences in the metabolome of D. polymorpha to avoid confounding factors, particularly when investigating environmental effects on molecular regulation in the gonads, and to a lesser extent in the digestive glands.},

	abstract = {With the growing demand for aquatic products, aquaculture has become a prominent means of meeting this demand. However, the selection of suitable sites for aquaculture remains a key factor in the success of any aquaculture operation. While various methods exist for site selection, geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) methods have emerged as the most widely utilized approach to identifying potential aquaculture sites. Following the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA), this paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of GIS-based MCE methods used in aquaculture sites selection. The objective of this study is to offer a comprehensive overview of existing research in this field and develop a general model for selecting sites for fish and shellfish aquaculture. The main findings indicate a growing number of studies utilizing GIS-based MCE in aquaculture site selection in recent years, with Asia being the leading continent in terms of publications in this domain. Among the journals publishing in this field, the Aquaculture journal stands out as the top publisher. Using consistent criteria across the reviewed studies, two models have been generated, each consisting of four sub-models: water quality, soil quality, infrastructure, and socioeconomic factors; and topography, environment, and physical parameters. These models can aid future researchers and assist decision-makers in identifying optimal locations for aquaculture development.},

The use of a triadic approach (bioaccumulation, bioassay, and physiological biomarkers) has been shown to have good applicability for the comparative assessment of the environmental state of the Neva Estuary (Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea). The novelty of the methodological approach of the study was that it involved both active and passive bio-monitoring methods for assessing the quality of estuarine environment. The classical analyses of metal concentration in bottom sediments, in field biota (fish and molluscs), and in caged molluscs were accompanied by a bioassay of sediment toxicity using amphipods. The physiological state of molluscs kept in cages was assessed according to two functional characteristics, such as cardio-tolerance and metabolic activity (oxygen consumption rate), after exposition in cages. The method of active monitoring (caging exposure with molluscs) as a measurement of parameters in clean molluscs has proven itself well in controlling the accumulation of both metals and oil products. Macroalgae that are abundant in estuarine ecosystems are also good indicators of metals, at least showing the transition from bottom sediments to the next level of food webs. Unionid molluscs were found to be a more sensitive and effective indicator of contaminant accumulation than dreissenid molluscs, characterized by a low tolerance to changeable environmental conditions in the estuarine ecosystem and rather high mortality in cages. Our results have shown that caging exposure with unionids can be a widely used methodological approach for the assessment of estuarine environmental quality through the determination of metal concentrations in molluscs and their physiological state.},

However, its effect on cyanobacterial biofilms is poorly investigated. In this work, biofilm formation by two filamentous cyanobacterial strains was evaluated over seven weeks on two surfaces commonly used in marine environments: glass and silicone-based paint (Sil-Ref) under controlled hydrodynamic conditions. After seven weeks, the biofilms were treated with a solution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to assess if disinfection could affect long-term biofilm development. The cyanobacterial biofilms appeared to be tolerant to H2O2 treatment, and two weeks after treatment, the biofilms that developed on glass by one of the strains presented higher biomass amounts than the untreated biofilms. This result emphasizes the need to correctly evaluate the efficiency of disinfection in cyanobacterial biofilms, including assessing the possible consequences of inefficient disinfection on the regrowth of these biofilms.},

However, proteomic resources for sentinel species are limited, and organ-level investigations are necessary to expand our understanding of their molecular biology. This study presents proteomic resources obtained from proteogenomic analyses of key organs (hepatopancreas, gills, hemolymph) from three established aquatic sentinel invertebrate species of interest in ecotoxicological/ecological research and environmental monitoring: Gammarus fossarum, Dreissena polymorpha, and Palaemon serratus. Proteogenomic analyses identified thousands of proteins for each species, with over 90\% of them being annotated to putative function. Functional analysis validated the relevance of the proteomic atlases by revealing similarities in functional annotation of catalogues of proteins across analogous organs in the three species, while deep contrasts between functional profiles are delimited across different organs in the same organism. These organ-level proteomic atlases are crucial for future research on these sentinel animals, aiding in the evaluation of aquatic environmental risks and providing a valuable resource for ecotoxicological studies.},

	abstract = {Dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) have changed the fundamental community structure and biogeochemical processes of the Lake Michigan nearshore zone. There is evidence that dreissenids promote the nuisance growth of benthic algae, especially Cladophora sp. In addition, benthic macroinvertebrates have benefitted from the presence of dreissenid mussels due to the increased structural complexity along with greater nutrient availability in the benthos. These effects of the dreissenid mussel invasion are well documented; however, little is known about how these systems respond to the removal of dreissenid mussels from a once-populated area. Therefore, it is important to further our understanding of the role dreissenid mussels play in the benthic ecosystem as we contemplate future management strategies in Lake Michigan.There have been few attempts to remove large areas of dreissenid mussels in the Great Lakes: however, mussel removal attempts have been successful in both initially removing the populations from an area and preventing the re-establishment of those populations. This may be due to heavy predation of juvenile dreissenid mussels by the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) which may inhibit the repopulation of dreissenids once they are removed. In 2021, we removed a 140 m2 area of dreissenid mussels by depriving them of oxygen and nutrients using a benthic barrier membrane. This was followed by monitoring the response of the benthic community over a one-year period and comparing community composition to that on a control site where mussels were still present in large numbers (5471 ± 1709 individuals m-2). The goal of this project was to further our understanding of the relationship between dreissenids, benthic algae, and benthic macroinvertebrates in the Lake Michigan nearshore zone in Good Harbor Bay near Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Benthic invertebrate abundance and algae biomass were measured by gathering in situ samples. Additionally, in situ incubations and oxygen measurements along with laboratory experiments were used to determine the production of the algae. The internal phosphorus in the algal tissue was measured and compared to the algae production to determine how the concentration of internal phosphorus affects algae production. These experiments showed an increase in algae production when in the presence of mussels compared to algae grown in the absence of mussels. The results of in situ and lab experiments were comparable and revealed that Lake Michigan benthic algae has a minimum internal cell P quota (the minimum required to support net growth) that is lower than previously reported values of Cladophora and corresponds with the very low molar carbon: phosphorus ratios frequently measured in Lake Michigan Cladophora, while the measured maximum growth rate was similar to previously reported values. We used the results of in situ and laboratory experiments in a Cladophora growth model to highlight the sensitivity of benthic algal community response to small internal P changes in extremely low P environments and explore the response of the benthic algal community to light and nutrient conditions.Throughout the summer, we observed depressed non-dreissenid invertebrate abundances, lower algae productivity, and major differences in algal community composition on the mussel-free site compared to the control site. We show that this may be attributed to a lack of nutrient cycling and availability, in the absence of dreissenid mussels, accompanied by reduced habitat structural complexity. The algae on the mussel-free site had lower particulate phosphorus concentrations than that on the control site. Lower 13C-enrichment of algae in the presence of mussels is interpreted as reflecting the photosynthetic fixation of isotopically light CO2 respired by mussels, highlight the dependence of benthic algae on both carbon and nutrients released by dreissenids. These findings can be used to explore the effects of future large scale dreissenid removal efforts on nuisance benthic algae and nearshore food web structure.},

To assess the environmental contamination in the study area, seawater quality and pollutant bioaccumulation throughout the soft tissue of mussels were investigated. The samples were collected in July 2022 at four sites on the Romanian Black Sea coast considered to be differently affected by contamination. To support the suitability of LMS as a biomarker of contaminant-induced stress, the contaminant body burdens of the mussels were compared with the NRRT values. The results showed a significantly reduced NRRT in all investigated locations, particularly in port areas (mean retention time between 11 and 14 min). The elevated bioaccumulation of organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and low NRRTs were observed at the most contaminated sites (i.e., ports). The low lysosomal stability reflected stress and damage in the hemocytes of mussels and could be related to the body burdens of contaminants. LMS is an effective indicator of health status in mussels and could be considered a sensitive biomarker of cellular stress induced by contaminant exposure.},

	abstract = {Freshwater mussels are threatened with extirpation in North America. They are a sentinel species for ecosystem function and contribute towards many ecosystem services. As mussels require clean water to survive, and since conserving ecosystem services is implicit in the federal Clean Water Act, incorporating mussel conservation into state water policies could serve multiple conservation goals. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive critical review of three topics related to freshwater mussels: their contribution to ecosystem services, their links with water quality, and threats to their survival from water pollutants and extent of protection available from regulation. In so doing, we identify gaps between the water quality requirements of mussels and the protection provided by current water regulation to help inform clean water and conservation goals in Minnesota. We find freshwater mussels to be generally sensitive to a wide variety of pollutants, and particularly to nutrients such as total nitrogen and total phosphorus and to major ions such as chloride. In addition, we find that current state water quality standards may not be sufficiently protective of mussels. We formulate a framework for determining an effective conservation strategy for mussels in Minnesota based on ecological and economic criteria to ensure adequate conservation at a reasonable cost.},

	abstract = {Due to globalisation and anthropopressure (intensification of shipping, creation of water corridors connecting seas, cultivation of commercial species), the movement of aquatic species has increased in recent years. The determination of trends in the movement of aquatic species in their geographical distribution over time is important because it may help in the management of a species in aquatic ecosystems. There are also knowledge gaps on the long-term trends in the movements of Southern European aquatic alien invertebrates. The study provides the first evidence of both northward and southward movements of these species based on available observations from 1940 to 2021, using meta-analyses and GAM modelling. To date, the majority (98\%) of analysed Southern European aquatic alien invertebrates of Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian origin have moved to the north. Among them, 61\% are Ponto-Caspian aquatic alien invertebrates that moved only to the north, and 4\% are Mediterranean aquatic alien invertebrates that moved only to the north; the rest include species that moved to the north and south: 27\% are Ponto-Caspian aquatic alien invertebrates, and 6\% are Mediterranean aquatic alien invertebrates. The one-way movement to the south was observed only in 2\% of Mediterranean aquatic alien species. The study will help in understanding the movement patterns of Southern European aquatic alien invertebrates and in the effective management of aquatic ecosystems that allow for the co-existence of people and the rest of biodiversity.},

Despite its high conservation priority, available data on the current population genetics and biogeography of P. complanata are very limited. In this paper, we studied the genetic diversity and differentiation of P. complanata based on newly sequenced COI and ND1 gene fragments, and on available sequences from the NCBI GenBank. We discovered a localized and highly divergent lineage in the Don River basin and a widespread but low diversified lineage distributed from the Volga River basin to the Oise River in France. A star-like haplotype network, results of mismatch analysis, and significant negative values of neutrality tests reveal that the pan-European lineage went through a bottleneck event. The discovery of the separate lineage in the Don River basin is and additional evidence of the existence of Pleistocene glacial refugia in the south of the Russian Plain. Moreover, this finding confirms the significance of the Azov Sea drainage as a freshwater biodiversity hotspot of great conservation importance.},

	abstract = {Marine biofouling is an undeniable challenge for aquatic systems since it is responsible for several environmental and ecological problems and economic losses. Several strategies have been developed to mitigate fouling-related issues in marine environments, including developing marine coatings using nanotechnology and biomimetic models, and incorporating natural compounds, peptides, bacteriophages, or specific enzymes on surfaces. The advantages and limitations of these strategies are discussed in this review, and the development of novel surfaces and coatings is highlighted. The performance of these novel antibiofilm coatings is currently tested by in vitro experiments, which should try to mimic real conditions in the best way, and/or by in situ tests through the immersion of surfaces in marine environments. Both forms present their advantages and limitations, and these factors should be considered when the performance of a novel marine coating requires evaluation and validation. Despite all the advances and improvements against marine biofouling, progress toward an ideal operational strategy has been slow given the increasingly demanding regulatory requirements. Recent developments in self-polishing copolymers and fouling-release coatings have yielded promising results which set the basis for the development of more efficient and eco-friendly antifouling strategies.},

	abstract = {The cave systems of the Neretva River basin in the Dinaric Karst are home to Congeria kusceri, one of the very few known examples of stygobiotic bivalve mollusks, which displays several unique life history traits and adaptations that allowed its adaptation to the subterranean environment. This endemic species is undergoing rapid decline, most likely linked with habitat degradation, which might seriously threaten its survival in the next few decades. Unfortunately, the urgent need for effective conservation efforts is hampered by the lack of effective regulations aimed at preserving remnant populations as well as by our limited knowledge of the biology of this species. Although the precise factors underlying the disappearance of C. kusceri from its type locations are not entirely clear, the alteration of seasonal changes in water temperatures and alkalinity is most likely involved, as these are the main drivers of shell growth, spawning, and the onset and progression of the new gametogenic cycle. While these aspects have so far only been studied using morphological and physiological observations, future conservation efforts would certainly benefit from an integrated multidisciplinary approach. Here, using RNA-sequencing, we provide an overview of the modulation of gene expression recorded in five key tissues (the mantle, gonads, gills, adductor muscle, and digestive gland) between early June and late September. We highlight the presence of markedly tissue-specific responses, with the most dramatic changes affecting the gonads, mantle, and gills. We further identified a drastic switch in the use of energy budgets between the two periods, with evidence of ongoing shell growth and high metabolic activity in the mantle and gills at the early time point, followed by a massive redirection of all available energy to the gonads for the generation of new gamete primordia in early autumn.},

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are volatile and short-lived molecules playing important roles in several physiological functions, including immunity and physiological adaptation to unsuitable environmental conditions. In an eco-immunological view, the energetic costs associated with an advantageous metabolic apparatus able to cope with wide changes in environmental parameters, e.g., temperature range, water salinity or drought, could be further balanced by the advantages that this apparatus may also represent in other situations, e.g., during the immune response. This review provides an overview of molluscs included in the IUCN list of the worst invasive species, highlighting how their relevant capacity to manage ROS production during physiologically challenging situations can also be advantageously employed during the immune response. Current evidence suggests that a relevant capacity to buffer ROS action and their damaging consequences is advantageous in the face of both environmental and immunological challenges, and this may represent a trait for potential invasiveness. This should be considered in order to obtain or update information when investigating the potential of the invasiveness of emerging alien species, and also in view of ongoing climate changes.},

	abstract = {Predicting which non-native species will negatively impact biodiversity is a longstanding research priority. The Functional Response (FR ; resource use in relation to availability) is a classical ecological concept that has been increasingly applied to quantify, assess and compare ecological impacts of non-native species. Despite this recent growth, an overview of applications and knowledge gaps across relevant contexts is currently lacking. We conducted a systematic review using a combination of terms regarding FR and invasion science to synthesise scientific studies that apply the FR approach in the field and to suggest new areas where it could have valuable applications. Trends of publications using FR in invasion science and publications about FR in general were compared through the Activity Index. Data were extracted from papers to reveal temporal, bibliographic, and geographic trends, patterns in study attributes such as type of interaction and habitat investigated, taxonomic groups used, and context-dependencies assessed. In total, 120 papers were included in the review. We identified substantial unevenness in the reporting of FRs in invasion science, despite a rapidly growing number of studies. To date, research has been geographically skewed towards North America and Europe, as well as towards predator-prey interactions in freshwater habitats. Most studies have focused on a few species of invertebrates and fishes. Species origin, life stage, environmental temperature and habitat complexity were the most frequently considered context-dependencies. We conclude that while the FR approach has thus far been narrowly applied, it has broad potential application in invasion science and can be used to test major hypotheses in this research field.},

In addition to this, the study also intends to review their ecological requirements to gain a better understanding of their invasive potential and distribution dynamics. Specifically, the study focuses on updating the distribution and ecological characteristics of these freshwater bivalves in the lower sector of the Danube River and the lakes of the Danube Delta. The purpose is to better understand their invasive and distribution dynamics and to develop effective measures to limit their spread in the future. To achieve this, environmental proxies such as sediment particle size and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) concentrations were used to assess their tolerances. However, the results did not show a significant correlation between the densities of these bivalves and the analyzed environmental parameters. Despite this, the species were found in high densities and formed well-developed benthic communities in some stations. The study contributes to the understanding of the invasiveness of these bivalve species and their distribution range dynamics. Nonetheless, further investigation is required to fully comprehend the role of environmental parameters in their distribution. The study covers the period between 2010 and 2020 and focuses on the lower Danube River sector and Danube Delta.},

	abstract = {The objectives of our survey were to determine the most important environmental factors within buffer zones that influenced mollusc communities and to evaluate the ecological conservation value of natural aquatic habitats (NAHs) that support mollusc species. Analysis of the spatial structure of buffer zones and catchments was based on a set of landscape metrics. Land cover classes were determined, and buffer zones within a radius of 500 m from a sampling point were marked out. Mollusc samples were collected from each NAHs. Our results showed that the number of patches and mean patch size were most associated with the distribution of mollusc species. Within patches of buffer zones, the length of the catchment boundaries with low-density housing, an increasing area of forest and pH of the water were also significant. Our results proved that landscape metrics provide essential information about catchment anthropogenic transformation. Therefore, landscape metrics and the designated buffer zones should be included in restoration plans for the river, water bodies and adjacent habitats as elements of modern, sustainable water management. NAHs located along a valley of a lowland river provide refuges for molluscs, play an essential role in the dispersal of IAS, create important protective biogeochemical barriers for rivers, constitute necessary sources of moisture and water and support microhabitats for distinct mollusc communities, especially in the context of global warming.},

	abstract = {Aquatic non-indigenous species (NIS) threaten biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and the economy worldwide. Monitoring NIS is of immediate concern to identify newly arriving species, assess the efficacy of mitigation measures, and report long-term indicators of introduction, spread, and impacts. The challenges associated with conventional methods of specimen collection and morphological identification have led to the development of alternative methods, such as DNA-based methods, which could offer rapid and cost-effective detection of NIS. Depending on whether a few (targeted monitoring) or many species (passive monitoring) are being monitored, environmental DNA (eDNA) can infer presence-absence and relative abundances, enabling informed decisions and actions to be made based on patterns of detection. Compared to more conventional methods, eDNA tools can increase the levels of detection and sensitivity for rare and elusive species, which is even more noticeable for some taxa when using targeted monitoring. The use of DNA-based tools not only minimizes the onus on taxonomic expertise and reduces resource demands but can also be more sensitive and cost-efficient in detecting NIS, thus proving its value as an early warning tool. As nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) methods advance rapidly for NIS detection, there must be a balance between method sensitivity, logistical requirements, and associated costs, which must be factored into future management decisions. While there are many complementary reviews available, our aim is to emphasize the importance of incorporating eDNA tools into NIS surveys and to highlight the available opportunities in this field.},

They represent a major threat to native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and can affect negatively human health and the economy. We assessed the presence and potential pressure by IAS on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems across 27 European countries, for 66 IAS of policy concern. We computed a spatial indicator that accounts for the number of IAS present in an area and the extent of the ecosystems affected; for each ecosystem, we also looked at the pattern of invasions in the different biogeographical regions. We found disproportionally greater invasion in the Atlantic region, followed by Continental and Mediterranean regions, possibly related to historical patterns of first introductions. Urban and freshwater ecosystems were the most invaded (nearly 68\% and ca. 52\% of their extent respectively), followed by forest and woodland (nearly 44\%). The average potential pressure of IAS was greater across cropland and forests, where we also found the lowest coefficient of variation. This assessment can be repeated over time to derive trends and monitor progress towards environmental policy objectives.},

	abstract = {Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are an expensive problem and the best thing we can do to manage AIS is to prevent their spread. Preventing the spread of AIS requires an interjurisdictional and big data approach to find pathways, locations, and people to prioritize for early interventions. In this dissertation, I use innovative methods and sources of data to guide decision making in AIS prevention efforts. First, anglers are major vectors of AIS and identifying pathways of angler movement provide an opportunity to intervene and stop the spread. Angler movement data has previously been restricted by costly angler surveys with low participation rates. Using catch logs from a widely popular angler app, I built an angler network that revealed an invasion superhighway that spanned the United States and likely contributed to the spread of two prolific invaders (e.g., Dreissena and Myriophyllum species). Next, identifying lakes that are vulnerable to invasion provide an opportunity for early detection and intervention. I used machine learning models to predict the presence of five aquatic invaders that have spread across the Upper Mississippi River basin. The models identified important features that make a lake vulnerable to invasion and identified high-risk sites for prioritizing AIS management. Then I discussed methods of dealing with poor data quality in big data used for invasive species management and proposed methods of data gathering to improve future studies. Lastly, targeted education and inspection of the most transient anglers would be valuable in slowing the spread of AIS. The variability in angler experience, skill, and motivation, means that anglers pose a heterogeneous risk to spreading AIS. In the last study, I used the angler app data to infer several characteristics of angler behavior and tendencies to predict transience. The results provided information to better inform AIS public outreach and enforcement campaigns. By identifying the pathways, locations, and people for targeted AIS management, this dissertation provides tangible results and scalable methods for preventative efforts. This work highlights the important role anglers can play in the prevention of AIS spread. However, it also demonstrates a need for better largescale data management and quality improvements that are necessary for studying AIS at an appropriately large-scale.},

	abstract = {This review discusses several research studies that employed comet assay to evaluate the environmental impact of genotoxins in aquatic environments. It focuses on in vivo and in situ studies of aquatic animals. New chemicals are being added each year to the existing burden of toxic substances in the environment. Excessive agricultural and industrial activities adversely affect biodiversity, threatening the survival of species in a particular habitat, as well as posing disease risks to humans. Some of the chemicals, e.g., pesticides and heavy metals, may be genotoxic to the sentinel species and/or to non-target species, causing deleterious effects in somatic or germ cells. Comet assay is a quick, sensitive, and low-cost technique for detecting DNA strand breakage. However, the comet assay has much more to offer than being an assay for testing DNA strand breaks in animal organs. The use of repair enzymes increases the range of DNA lesions that can be detected with the assay. Comparing data from studies that employed different approaches, such as empirical scoring or comet tail lengths, comet assay is one of the challenging techniques to be utilized in environmental studies. The relative amount of DNA in the comet tail indicates DNA break intensity. The assay has been modified to detect various base alterations by including the digestion of nucleoids with a lesion-specific endonuclease. The determination of DNA damage in these indicator species using the comet test would thus offer information on the genotoxic potential of their habitat at an early stage. This would enable intervention techniques to prevent or mitigate adverse health impacts in sentinel animals and humans.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryIn this study, we simulated the distribution range and its shift of Pantala flavescens in past, present, and future scenarios, and revealed its habitat properties. Except at high latitudes near the poles (e.g., Antarctica and near the Arctic Circle), it is found almost everywhere in the world, with the most suitable habitat mainly in East Asia and the United States. The max temperature of the warmest month and the precipitation of the wettest month are important factors affecting its distribution, and its suitability decreases with the increase of altitude. Climate warming promoted the shift of lowly and moderately suitable habitats into moderately and highly suitable habitats, especially in equatorial regions, which increased the total habitat area. This study provides a global dynamic distribution pattern of P. flavescens across large temporal and spatial scales, and provides a reference for further understanding of its biodiversity and conservation.AbstractDragonflies are sensitive to climate change due to their special habitat in aquatic and terrestrial environments, especially Pantala flavescens, which have extraordinary migratory abilities in response to climate change on spatio-temporal scales. At present, there are major gaps in the documentation of insects and the effects of climatic changes on the habitat and species it supports. In this study, we model the global distribution of a wandering glider dragonfly, P. flavescens, and detected the important environmental factors shaping its range, as well as habitat shifts under historical and future warming scenarios. The results showed a global map of species ranges of P. flavescens currently, including southern North America, most of South America, south-central Africa, most of Europe, South, East and Southeast Asia, and northern Oceania, in total, ca. 6581.667 × 104 km2. BIO5 (the max temperature of warmest month) and BIO13 (the precipitation of wettest month) greatly explained its species ranges. The historic refugia were identified around the Great Lakes in the north-central United States. Future warming will increase the total area of suitable habitat and shift the type of suitable habitat compared to the current distribution. The habitat suitability of P. flavescens decreased with elevation, global warming forced it to expand to higher elevations, and the habitat suitability of P. flavescens around the equator increased with global warming. Overall, our study provides a global dynamic pattern of suitable habitats for P. flavescens from the perspective of climate change, and provides a useful reference for biodiversity research and biological conservation.},

In this review, we summarize the biological information about shellfish biomonitors and the results of studies focused on the development and use of the bioindicator species in early warning systems in Russia. Since the mid-1980s, Russian specialists have developed online biomonitoring systems; as in the rest of world, there are two main approaches that are currently applied to study the physiological status of potential biosensor shellfish species and to monitor freshwater and marine systems: valvometry (registration of gaping activity in bivalve mollusks) and photoplethysmography (registration of cardiac activity in mollusks and crustaceans). Valve movement responses to stressors such as abnormal conditions and pollutants include the closure of shell valves for a long period, decrease in the average distance between valves, rapid shell opening, and higher closing frequency. Cardiac activity reactions of shellfish to stress factors include rapid increases in heart rate and stress index, higher variability in heart rate than under normal conditions, and longer periods required for heart rate recovery after stress. The most common bioindicators used to monitor environmental disturbances in marine ecosystems are blue mussels, Iceland scallops, and red king crabs in cold-water habitats and Black Sea mussels in warmer waters as well as freshwater mussels and crayfish in fresh waters.},

Contaminated freshwater sludge was treated with CNS coupled with a filtering fine-mesh net, and the obtained waters were tested for acute and sublethal toxicity. In order to check the safety of the proposed treatment system, toxicity tests were conducted by exposing the bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri and the crustacean Heterocypris incongruens, while subtoxicity biomarkers such as lysosomal membrane stability, genetic, and chromosomal damage assessment were performed on the freshwater bivalve Dreissena polymorpha. Dredging sludge was found to be genotoxic, and such genotoxicity was mitigated by the combined use of CNS and a filtering fine-mesh net. Chemical analyses confirmed the results by highlighting the abetment of target contaminants, indicating the present model as a promising tool in freshwater sludge nanoremediation.},

In Spain and Portugal, it was recorded for the first time in 2003 and 2010, respectively, and its impact on Stone Pine (Pinus pinea) is of major concern. Before developing control measures for this insect pest, it is paramount to clarify its spatiotemporal dynamics of invasion. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to (a) characterise the genetic structure and diversity and (b) invasion pathways of L. occidentalis populations in the Iberian Peninsula. To do so, specimens of L. occidentalis were collected at fourteen sites widely distributed within the Iberian Peninsula. We used mtDNA sequences of Cytochrome b and eleven microsatellite markers to characterise the genetic diversity and the population structure in the Iberian Peninsula. Our genetic results combined with the observational dates strongly support a stratified expansion of L. occidentalis invasion in the Iberian Peninsula proceeding from multiple introductions, including at least one in Barcelona, one in Valencia, and one in the west coast or in the Southeastern region.},

	abstract = {Thiamine (vitamin B1) metabolism is an important driver of human and animal health and ecological functioning. Some organisms, including species of ferns, mollusks, and fish, contain thiamine-degrading enzymes known as thiaminases, and consumption of these organisms can lead to thiamine deficiency in the consumer. Consumption of fish containing thiaminase has led to elevated mortality and recruitment failure in farmed animals and wild salmonine populations around the world. In the North American Great Lakes, consumption of the non-native prey fish alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) by native lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) led to thiamine deficiency in the trout, contributed to elevated fry mortality, and impeded natural population recruitment. Several thiaminases have been genetically characterized in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes, and the source of thiaminase in multicellular organisms has been hypothesized to be gut microflora. In an unexpected discovery, we identified thiaminase I genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) with homology to bacterial tenA thiaminase II. The biochemical activity of zebrafish thiaminase I (GenBank NP\_001314821.1) was confirmed in a recombinant system. Genes homologous to the zebrafish tenA-like thiaminase I were identified in many animals, including common carp (Cyprinus carpio), zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and alewife. Thus, the source of thiaminase I in alewife impacting lake trout populations is likely to be de novo synthesis.},

However, to date, no comprehensive quantifications of the reported economic costs of these species have been done. Here, we used the InvaCost database on the monetary impact of invasive alien species to identify the costs of those facilitated by three major canal systems: the European Inland Canals, Suez Canal, and Panama Canal. While we identified a staggering number of species having spread via these systems, monetary costs have been reported only for a few. A total of \$33.6 million in costs have been reported from species linked to European Inland Canals (the fishhook waterflea Cercopagis pengoi and the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha) and \$8.6 million linked to the Suez Canal (the silver-cheeked toadfish Lagocephalus sceleratus, the lionfish Pterois miles, and the nomad jellyfish Rhopilema nomadica), but no recorded costs were found for species facilitated by the Panama Canal. We thus identified a pervasive lack of information on the monetary costs of invasions facilitated by canals and highlighted the uneven distribution of costs.},

	abstract = {Invasive marine species are well documented but options to manage them are limited. At Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge (Central North Pacific), native invasive corallimorpharians, Rhodactis howesii, have smothered live native corals since 2007. Laboratory and field trials were conducted evaluating two control methods to remove R. howesii overgrowing the benthos at Palmyra Atoll (Palmyra): 1) paste mixed with chlorine, citric acid, or sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and 2) hot water. Paste mixed with NaOH had the most efficacious kill in mesocosm trials and resulted in {\textgreater} 90\% kill over a 98 m² area three days after treatment. Hot water at 82°C was most effective in mesocosms; in the field hot water was less effective than paste but still resulted in a kill of ca. 75\% over 100 m² three days after treatment. Costs of paste and heat (excluding capital equipment and costs of regulatory approval should this method be deployed large scale) were \$70/m² and \$59/m² respectively. Invasive R. howesii currently occupy ca 5,800,000 m² of reef at Palmyra with ca. 276,000 m² comprising heavily infested areas. Several potential management strategies are discussed based on costs of treatment, area covered, and the biology of the invasion. The methods described here expand the set of tools available to manage invasive species in complex marine habitats.},

	abstract = {Early detection of dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis) is crucial to mitigating the economic and environmental impacts of an infestation. Plankton tow sampling is a common method used for early detection of dreissenid mussels, but little is known about the sampling intensity required for a high probability of early detection using the method. We used implicit dynamic occupancy models to estimate plankton tow detection probabilities of dreissenid mussels from a long-term data set containing plankton tow samples collected across central and western United States. We fit models using a) the entire data set, including water bodies with unknown occupancy status in addition to heavily infested water bodies, b) a data subset that included water bodies with paired water temperature data, and c) a data subset that included water bodies with lower dreissenid densities. For the entire data set, we found that estimated detection probabilities varied by water body size and ranged from approximately 0.10 to 0.86. For the water temperature subset, we observed the same pattern between detection probability and water body size as we did for the full data but additionally found that the estimated detection probabilities were much higher when water temperatures were above 12 °C. For the lower dreissenid density subset, we found that the estimated probability of detecting dreissenid mussels with a single aggregated plankton tow sample was near zero. Given these estimates, we conclude that the number of aggregated plankton tow samples taken per water body in the data is far fewer than the number needed to ensure a high probability of detecting dreissenid mussels, especially if they are at low densities. We summarize the analyses with a discussion of plankton tow sampling protocol changes needed to improve estimates of dreissenid detection probabilities.},

Their assessments are challenging, but most suffer from major flaws. Among the most important are the following: (1) the inclusion of actual damage costs together with various ancillary expenditures which may or may not be indicative of the real economic damage due to NIS; (2) the inclusion of the costs of unnecessary or counterproductive control initiatives; (3) the inclusion of controversial NIS-related costs whose economic impacts are questionable; (4) the assessment of the negative impacts only, ignoring the positive ones that most NIS have on the economy, either directly or through their ecosystem services. Such estimates necessarily arrive at negative and often highly inflated values, do not reflect the net damage and economic losses due to NIS, and can significantly misguide management and resource allocation decisions.

The discovery of live C. fluminea in a central Minnesota lake absent any known thermal refuge in 2020 presented an opportunity to further evaluate the overwinter survival and population structure of C. fluminea at the presumed edge of their potential range. The population was monitored from December 2020 through September 2021 alongside water temperature to better understand at which temperatures C. fluminea survived and if the population structure suggested reproduction occurring in the lake. We documented live C. fluminea in temperatures as low as 0.3°C. Shell size of recovered individuals suggested multiple cohorts, and the appearance of a new cohort at the end of the study, indicating active reproduction in the lake and suggesting the population had likely been present in the lake for at least two winters by the conclusion of the study period. Our findings provide evidence of the survival below historically documented lower lethal temperature limits and suggests adaptations to modeling predicting suitable habitat, both present and in a changing climate, are necessary to better assess risk of invasion by this species.},

	abstract = {Environmental (e)DNA tools are sensitive and cost-effective for early detection of invasive species. However, the uncertainty associated with the interpretation of positive eDNA detections makes it challenging to determine appropriate natural resource management responses. Multiple sources of error can give rise to positive detections of eDNA in a sample when individuals of that species are not present at the site or a widespread infestation is not imminent. Acting on an erroneous eDNA inference could result in needless costs or reductions in desirable resources. Alternatively, failure to rapidly act on eDNA results that truly indicate invader presence could compound negative impacts and lead to high, long-term costs to manage infestations. We used a structured decision making (SDM) process, which incorporates tradeoffs and uncertainties, to evaluate appropriate response actions following hypothetical eDNA detections of invasive dreissenid mussel (Dreissena spp.) eDNA in Jordanelle Reservoir, Utah (USA). We worked with decision-makers and stakeholders to identify objectives and discrete management action alternatives to assess consequences and tradeoffs. Alternatives ranged from no action to intensive and expensive control efforts. The best performing alternative was delayed containment described by immediate attempts to confirm the eDNA detections using non-molecular sampling techniques followed by mandatory watercraft exit inspections to prevent dreissenid mussel spread to regional water bodies. Non-molecular sampling increased public support for management by demonstrating a commitment to monitor the invasion state before action, whereas containment decreased likelihood of regional spread to other waters. Delayed containment had the lowest downside risk, and the highest upside gains relative to other alternative actions. Sensitivity analyses showed our results to be robust to parameter and outcome uncertainty.},

	abstract = {As strategic transport infrastructures, canals provide wide-ranging economic benefits as well as save energy and reduce CO2 emissions. At the same time, by connecting previously biogeographically-isolated systems, they serve as corridors for the introduction and spread of aquatic alien species, potentially leading to unforeseen ecological and economic impacts. To date, there has been no attempt to quantify the reported economic costs of these species. Here, we used the InvaCost database on the monetary impact of invasive alien species to identify the costs of species whose introduction and spread have been linked to the operation of three major canal systems: the European Inland Canals, Suez Canal and Panama Canal. While we identified a staggering number of alien species that have been spread via these systems, monetary costs have been reported only for a few of these known invasive aliens. A total of \$33.6 million in costs have been reported from invasive species linked to European Inland Canals (the fishhook waterflea Cercopagis pengoi and the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha) and \$8.6 million linked to the Suez Canal (the silver-cheeked toadfish Lagocephalus sceleratus, the lionfish Pterois miles, and the nomad jellyfish Rhopilema nomadica), but no recorded costs were yet recorded for species which invasion was facilitated by the Panama Canal. We thus identified a pervasive lack of information on the monetary costs of invasions facilitated by anthropogenically-created corridors, such as canals. In highlighting the uneven and lacking distribution of costs, we suggest those benefiting from the creation of canals are not necessarily the same as those paying the incurred costs, and urge greater recognition and reporting of impacts.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.13161},
	abstract = {The late goldenrod (Soldiago gigantea Aiton; Asteraceae) is one of the most abundant invasive species in various types of habitats. Its long-creeping plagiotropic rhizomes enable the plant to build up dense, monospecific stands within a short time. Particularly in nature conservation areas, the invasion of goldenrod can cause severe disruptions in the naturally occuring mutualims between plants, insects and higher trophic levels, subsequently impeding the achievement of nature conservation goals. As management options of goldenrod in nature conservation areas are limited, this three-year study aimed to test the effectiveness of three management treatments (two-time mowing, triticale cultivation, and reverse rotary cutting) on four different sites in the Austrian Donau-Auen National Park. The number and height of goldenrod shoots were recorded three times a year on twelve permanent trial plots on each site to test for the effectiveness of the treatments. In addition, vegetation surveys were performed to observe the recovery potential of native plant species. Even though the three-years mowing and the triticale cultivation reduced goldenrod by 95.6\% and 97.2\% resp., we could find no relation between the effectiveness of the treatment and the intensity of disturbance created by the control option. On the contrary, with a reduction of only 5.4\% in goldenrod density the most intensive treatment, the rotary cutting, showed the lowest efficiency. The highest positive effect on the re-establishment of native plant species was recorded with two mowing events per year. Even though the study revealed that certain management options have the potential to effectively reduce goldenrod and to simultaneously increase the establishment success of native species, results can only be seen as so-called snapshots. For example, as shown on site EJW one unforeseeable wild boar digging event transformed a 84.5\% reduction into a 4.7\% increase in goldenrod density. Therefore, a proper and regular monitoring is essential to be able to react to the effects of unpredictable events that can have severe impact on vegetation dynamics.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to identify the importance of ecological factors to distribution patterns of the invasive Clam (Corbicula fluminea) relative to native mussels (family: Unionidae) across seven rivers within the Mobile and Tennessee basins, Southeast United States. We quantitatively surveyed dense, diverse native mussel aggregations across 20 river reaches and estimated mussel density, biomass, and species richness along with density of invasive C. fluminea (hereafter Corbicula). We measured substrate particle size, velocity, and depth in quadrats where animals were collected. Additionally, we characterized reach scale environmental parameters including seston quantity and quality (\% Carbon, \% Nitrogen, \% Phosphorous), water chemistry (ammonium [NH4+], soluble reactive phosphorous [SRP]), and watershed area and land cover. Using model selection, logistic regression, and multivariate analysis, we characterized habitat features and their association to invasive Corbicula within mussel beds. We found that Corbicula were more likely to occur and more abundant in quadrats with greater mussel biomass, larger substrate size, faster water velocity, and shallower water depth. At the reach scale, Corbicula densities increased where particle sizes were larger. Mussel richness, density, and biomass increased with watershed area. Water column NH4+ increased at reaches with more urban land cover. No land cover variables influenced Corbicula populations or mussel communities. The strong overlapping distribution of Corbicula and mussels support the hypothesis that Corbicula are not necessarily limited by habitat factors and may be passengers of change in rivers where mussels have declined due to habitat degradation. Whether Corbicula is facilitated by mussels or negatively interacts with mussels in these systems remains to be seen. Focused experiments that manipulate patch scale variables would improve our understanding of the role of species interactions (e.g., competition, predation, facilitation) or physical habitat factors in influencing spatial overlap between Corbicula and native mussels.},

	abstract = {Ships and boats may transport whole communities of non-indigenous species through hull biofouling, some members of which may become invasive. Several studies have evaluated the diversity of these communities, but very few have analyzed the survival of organisms after their voyages into different and potentially inhospitable conditions. This factor is important to consider because the last port of call approach for risk assessments assumes that if the conditions observed in the last port of call are different from those observed in a receiving port, risks are diminished or null. Using an innovative experimental system, we tested the survival and recovery of the marine blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the freshwater zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) by exposing them to adverse salinity conditions at varying temperatures to simulate ships and boats transiting to ports or marinas with contrasting environmental conditions. Both mussel species, which are well-known for their adaptability to new environments as aquatic non-indigenous species, survived better at colder temperatures, with blue mussels surviving up to 14 days in freshwater, and zebra mussels up to 8 days in marine water. This highlights the importance of considering the resistance of fouling organisms to adverse conditions in vector and species risk assessments.},

	abstract = {Background 
Predicting invasiveness requires an understanding of the propensity of a given species to thrive in areas with novel ecological challenges. Evaluation of realized niche shift of an invasive species in its invasive range, detecting the main drivers of the realized niche shift, and predicting the potential distribution of the species can provide important information for the management of populations of invasive species and the conservation of biodiversity. The Australian redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti, is a widow spider that is native to Australia and established in Japan, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia. We used ecological niche models and ordinal comparisons in an integrative method to compare the realized niches of native and invasive populations of this spider species. We also assessed the impact of several climatic predictor variables and human activity on this niche shift. We hypothesized that human impact is important for successful establishment of this anthropophilic species, and that climatic predictor variables may determine suitable habitat and thus predict invasive ranges.
Results
Our models showed that L. hasselti distributions are positively influenced by human impact in both of the native and invasive ranges. Maximum temperature was the most important climatic variable in predictions of the distribution of native populations, while precipitation seasonality was the most important in predictions of invasive populations. The realized niche of L. hasselti in its invasive range differed from that in its native range, indicating possible realized niche shift.
Conclusions
We infer that a preference for human-disturbed environments may underlie invasion and establishment in this spider species, as anthropogenic habitat modifications could provide shelters from unsuitable climatic conditions and extreme climatic stresses to the spiders. Because Australia and the countries in which the species is invasive have differing climates, differences in the availability of certain climatic conditions could have played a role in the realized niche shift of L. hasselti.},

	abstract = {Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) are a top predator native to the Laurentian Great Lakes, with a wide distribution in North America. Our understanding of Smallmouth Bass ecology is extensive, although primarily based on research from smaller inland lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. In Lake Ontario, there is an urgent need for additional research on this species due to the apparent declines and invasive species-mediated changes in the Smallmouth Bass population in recent years, documented by provincial and state agencies. A better understanding of the status of Smallmouth Bass populations is especially important in the Southern Great Lakes since pressure from recreational anglers also appears to be increasing. The objective of the present study was to examine whether a novel acoustic telemetry approach could be used to obtain information on the spatial ecology of Smallmouth Bass in the eastern basin of Lake Ontario. Near continuous detections were recorded for eleven Smallmouth Bass, expanding the practical toolbox of passive acoustic telemetry in large lake ecosystems. The present study also provides evidence that this species exhibits local residency to a greater degree than previously understood. Smallmouth Bass depth use and activity rate varied seasonally, with winter characterized by deeper depths and lower vertical and horizontal activity relative to the summer period. Home range size decreased during the overwintering period, with simultaneous shifts in home range centrality towards deeper bathymetric features surrounding the study site. The use of a smallscale passive array to study a nearshore predator in the Great Lakes is a novel approach that has improved our understanding of Smallmouth Bass ecology. The findings of this research also have important implications for assessing, managing and conserving the Smallmouth Bass populations in the Great Lakes.},

	abstract = {Lake Huron has undergone dramatic and well-documented lake-wide food web changes as a result of non-native species introductions. Coastal beaches, which serve as nursery habitats for native and introduced species, are, however, relatively poorly studied. Our objective was to assess fish assemblages of beach habitats in western Lake Huron and compare species composition pre- (1993) and post-invasion (2012) of dreissenid mussels and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Nearshore beach fish assemblages were sampled by nighttime beach seining during spring and summer in 1993 and 2012 in the western basin of Lake Huron along the Michigan shoreline. Catch rates were considerably higher, but there were fewer species present in 2012 than in 1993. The composition of species changed dramatically from a cold- and cool-water species assemblage in 1993 (dominated by alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius), and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), as well as Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)) to a cool- and warm-water species assemblage in 2012 (dominated by cyprinids, round goby (Nogobius melanstomus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens)). The observed rise in catch rate and shift in species composition appears related to the introduction of invasive species as well as an on-going warming pattern in nearshore waters.},

	abstract = {The estuarine ecosystems of Southern California serve numerous ecological and commercial functions but are under increasing anthropogenic pressure. Pollution and the expansion of nonindigenous species challenge these already vulnerable locales and the native species that inhabit them. The purpose of this study was to quantify the different types and concentrations of chemical contaminants detected in oyster tissue and surrounding sediment from Southern California estuaries. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis was utilized to investigate differential gene expression to compare site-specific and species-specific stress responses between a native and non-native oyster species. Tissue samples of the native Ostrea lurida and the non-native Crassostrea gigas as well as sediment samples were collected from six different sites across four estuaries. Tissue and sediment samples underwent chemical contaminant analysis to quantify concentrations of trace metal and organic contaminants while gill tissue samples underwent RNA-sequencing for differential gene expression analysis. Concentrations of various trace metal and organic analytes exceeded screening levels at multiple sites with sediment and C. gigas tissue varying statistically in their contaminant levels across sites. Contaminant types and concentrations reported here align with findings of past studies, indicating that various contaminants remain throughout Southern California estuaries in both biotic and environmental compartments. Notably, tissue and sediment samples from the San Diego Bay Boathouse (SDBBH) site displayed qualitatively the highest concentrations of PCBs, highlighting the need for further monitoring and assessment of legacy contaminants in estuarine habitats. Transcriptomic analysis revealed altered expression of various genes involved in oxidative stress and xenobiotic biotransformation. Specifically, we observed increased expression of glutathione-S-transferase in both O. lurida and C. gigas from SDBBH, which suggests increased PCB concentrations may be impacting the health of both oysters. Differential gene expression analysis between species was evaluated based on patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gene ontology (GO) terms. Overall, no GO terms were shared between the two species which provides evidence for a species-specific stress response. C. gigas exhibited enrichment of GO terms involved in ATP production and transporter pathways while O. lurida exhibited changes in GO terms involved in cellular homeostasis. These findings demonstrate that oysters throughout Southern California estuaries with varying contaminant levels displayed differential gene expression and a species-specific response observed in C. gigas may confer a higher tolerance to stressful conditions.},

	abstract = {The invasion of the Laurentian Great Lakes by aquatic invasive species (AIS) has been the subject of investigation for decades, due to their dramatic alterations to the ecosystem and high economic costs. Two AIS with the largest impacts are dreissenid zebra and quagga mussels, and though these species have been studied extensively, questions remain about what factors control their distributions, and whether lake warming will alter these distributions. Species distribution models (SDMs) offer a powerful tool to examine the relationship between species presences and environmental variables, which are typically bioclimactic data. The creation of the Aquatic Habitat (AqHab) dataset containing biological, chemical, geomorphological, hydrological variables within the Great Lakes provides a novel opportunity to build models that do not rely on atmospheric climate proxies. We hypothesized that the high-resolution AqHab dataset would produce SDMs with improved predictive capabilities for dreissenids than SDMs constructed with BioClim covariates. We also predicted niche differences between the dreissenids would be reflected by the models. SDM models were fitted using two algorithms: Maximum Entropy (MaxENT) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). AqHab models better predicted quagga mussel presence than BioClim models. Dreissenid niche differences, such as zebra preferring shallow, warm waters and quaggas preferring deep, cold waters, were apparent from all models. Our results imply that aquatic species distribution models may be improved with the addition of aquatic habitat environmental layers.},

	abstract = {The American charru mussel Mytella strigata (Hanley, 1843) is an invasive species of great concern along the shores of North America and Asia. As with most invasive mussels, it is very difficult to eradicate once established. Surveillance therefore plays a vital role in controlling its spread. Molecular tools like environmental DNA (eDNA) have proved to be useful in recent years to assist in the early detection and management of invasive species, with considerable advantages over conventional methods like substrate monitoring and sampling, which can be relatively laborious and time-intensive. This technique can be particularly useful in the initial stages of invasion when the population density is often too low to be detected by visual surveys alone. In the present study, we developed a species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach targeting a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) DNA fragment aimed at detecting the presence of M. strigata from water samples. We also investigated the relationship between mussel cover and eDNA concentration. Our approach was tested on coastal seawater samples from 14 sites in Singapore, supported by conventional visual quadrat surveys. The results showed clear, positive M. strigata eDNA detection for all sites where this species was observed visually during field surveys. However, there was a weakly negative correlation between percent mussel cover and eDNA concentration, indicating that mussel abundance could not be estimated reliably using seawater eDNA alone. Nevertheless, this study underscores the effectiveness of eDNA in informing the presence and distribution of M. strigata along extensive coastlines comprising different habitats. This approach contributes to a robust toolkit for routine surveillance at sites where invasion may be impending to control the spread of the invasive mussel.},

	abstract = {Invasive zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena spp.) in the Great Lakes of North America are biomonitors for chemical contaminants, but are also exposed to microplastics ({\textless} 5mm). Little research has examined in situ microplastic ingestion by dreissenid mussels, or the relationship between microplastics and chemical contaminants. We measured microplastics and chemical contaminants in mussel tissue from Milwaukee Harbor (Lake Michigan, USA) harvested from reference locations and sites influenced by wastewater effluent and urban river discharge. Mussels were deployed in cages in the summer of 2018, retrieved after 30 and 60 days, sorted by size class, and analyzed for microplastics and body burdens of three classes of contaminants: alkylphenols, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and petroleum biomarkers. Microplastics in mussels were higher in the largest mussels at the wastewater-adjacent site after 30 days deployment. However, there was no distinction among sites for microplastics in smaller mussels, and no differences among sites after 60 days of deployment. Microplastics and chemical contaminants in mussels were not correlated. Microplastics have a diversity of intrinsic and extrinsic factors which influence their ingestion, retention, and egestion by mussels, and which vary relative to chemicals. While dreissenid mussels may not serve as plastic pollution biomonitors like they can for chemical contaminants, microplastics in dreissenid mussels are widespread, variable, and have unknown effects on physiology, mussel-mediated ecosystem processes, and lake food webs. These data will inform our understanding of the spatial distribution of microplastics in urban freshwaters, the role of dreissenid mussels in plastic budgets, and models for the fate of plastic pollution.},

	abstract = {The ability to produce byssal threads enables invasive dreissenid mussels to attach to recreational boat hulls and other equipment. These mussels can be exposed to air during overland transport of recreational boats, which affects their potential to survive transport. Survival during air exposure is determined by a variety of environmental factors such as temperature, relative humidity, shaking and vibrations and the movement of air. This study assessed the influence of air movement on the survival and behavioural changes of the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis). Survival time decreased significantly when mussels were exposed to a wind speed of 10 and 50 km.h-1 compared to standing air survival. Mussel clumps survived significantly longer than mussel individuals. The lethal time of 99\% of mussel individuals (LT99) decreased from 29.26 to 18.24 hours when exposed to a wind speed of 50 km.h-1. At a wind speed of 10 km.h-1 LT99 survival times of mussel clumps (26.94 h) were higher compared to individual mussels (19.76 h). Valve gaping behaviour changed when mussels were exposed to flowing air. Mussels exposed to a wind speed of 10 km.h-1 were on average open for 6.41\% of the time, whereas in standing air mussels were on average open for 26.78\% of the time. These results indicate that air movement has an influence on the survival potential of aerially exposed quagga mussels. Management of invasive alien mussels should take into account that the quagga mussel can survive air exposure with an wind speed of 50 km.h-1 over 18 hours when attached to boat hulls. 50\% of the mussels can be transported alive for distances over 300 km and 1\% of the mussels can be transported alive for more than 900 km. Decontamination of boats and associated equipment will be vital for improved spread-prevention of invasive mussels.},

With a relative lack of research efforts in the tropics [49, 50], and the potential variation in identified traits at the local level ([51]; see also S1 Table), it is unclear if risk assessments performed within tropical regions would identify similar patterns or suites of traits as those conducted in other climatic regions.

[...]in light of this paucity of information, and a noted difference in invasibility of tropical ecosystems [52, 53], this study aims to determine if non-native species within tropical climates are associated with a different set of traits in overcoming the barriers in the invasion process.

	abstract = {Laboratory microcosm systems provide researchers with an invaluable tool to rapidly model real-world ecology in a highly-controlled environment. These models have already proved capable of predicting real-world outcomes in relation to a variety of ecological processes, but further microcosm investigations, and comparisons with real-world studies, are required before these systems can be relied upon as rapid diagnostic tools which can inform real-world management decisions. Here, the use of microcosm systems to model ecological processes involved in biological invasion events is discussed, and three experiments relating to these processes are described.1)	Preadaptation of Pseudomonas fluorescens to the biotic and abiotic environmental conditions in a soil microcosm was found to drive diversity within the P. fluorescens population, including genetic, morphological, and metabolic diversity. When inoculated into soil microcosms alongside a resident soil community, this diversity within this focal population drives greater changes in the community structure of the resident soil community compared with ancestral P. fluorescens SBW25. Interestingly, diversity of the focal population was found to be the single most important driver of changes in resident community structure, over the effects of fitness and of direct adaptations to the environment itself.2)	Preadaptation to disturbance-related mortality events may provide species with a competitive advantage during and after such events. Here, P. fluorescens populations preadapted to a range of disturbance regimes were subjected to competitive fitness assays in KB broth under both the regimes they were preadapted to, and the full range of regimes investigated. At 99\% mortality of resident populations, disturbance frequency was found to have a non-significant correlation with the morphological diversity of populations recovered at the end of the experimental period. As previous work has found significant effects of disturbance upon P. fluorescens morphological diversity using a similar system, at 99.9\% mortality, this study indicates that further work with this system may yield results of interest either using higher intensities or higher frequencies of disturbance than were investigated here.3)	Using whole natural microbial communities to study ecological processes within a microcosm system provides rapid results comparable to the complexities of real-world ecological systems, however, current understanding of the complex relationships of diverse microbial communities with the biotic and abiotic components of their environment are not currently fully understood. In order to truly understand the changes in resident community structure when conducting microcosm studies, a good understanding of the niche-space used by each member of the community is desirable. Here, a series of simple experiments yielded a small community of 5 microbial species that could be distinguished by eye beyond the end of a 6-week co-existence study. This lays the foundations for building an artificial community that can be easily characterised and manipulated when investigating ecological processes in microcosm systems, and provide data on changes in community structure without the need for complex or expensive equipment and techniques.},

Data were collected using the databases provided by two regional environmental agencies in northern Italy (Lombardy and Piedmont regions) and by the governmental monitoring program of Switzerland, which were integrated with a systematic literature search on Google scholar and ISI Web of Science. In the assessment area, 16 macroinvertebrate invasive alien species were reported: nine mollusks, four decapods, and three amphipods. The species assessment indicated seven species with a high level of invasiveness: Procambarus clarkii, Faxonius limosus (formerly, Orconectes limosus) and Pacifastacus leniusculus, Dreissena polymorpha, Corbicula fluminea, Sinanodonta woodiana, and Pseudosuccinea columella. The results allow invasive species managers to understand which species to focus their monitoring on in the near future in order to track IAS movements and limit their spread within the hydrographic system and to provide the identification and refinement of concerted bilateral strategies aimed at limiting the impacts of these species. They also account for the implications of future climate change on the invasion potential of each species.},

	abstract = {Zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is considered as one of the 100 most harmful IAS in the world. Traditional detection methods have limitations, and PCR based environmental DNA detection has provided interesting results for early warning. However, in the last years, the development of isothermal amplification methods has received increasing attention. Among them, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has several advantages, including its higher tolerance to the presence of inhibitors and the possibility of naked-eye detection, which enables and simplifies its potential use in decentralized settings. In the current study, a real-time LAMP (qLAMP) method for the detection of Dreissena polymorpha was developed and tested with samples from the Guadalquivir River basin, together with two real-time PCR (qPCR) methods using different detection chemistries, targeting a specific region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome C oxidase subunit I. All three developed approaches were evaluated regarding specificity, sensitivity and time required for detection. Regarding sensitivity, both qPCR approaches were more sensitive than qLAMP by one order of magnitude, however the qLAMP method proved to be as specific and much faster being performed in just 9 min versus 23 and 29 min for the qPCR methods based on hydrolysis probe and intercalating dye respectively.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of microplastics pollution in freshwater environments trails behind its practice in marine ecosystems. We evaluated the use of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) as a potential bioindicator of microplastic litter in freshwater lakes. Samples were collected from three sites (Lovere, Costa Volpino, Castro) at the northern end of Lake Iseo (one of the major subalpine lakes in north Italy) and compared for water physicochemical parameters, biometrical features of zebra mussels, and microplastics items/specimens (color, shape, size, and chemical composition). We hypothesized that since a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) on the Oglio River discharges into this area of the lake, the microplastics in D.polymorpha could be measured and compared in samples from the three sites at different distances from the WWTP. There was no difference in the physicochemical water parameters and biometric features between the samples from the three sites, whereas there was a significant difference in items/specimen between the sites in decreasing order (mean ± standard deviation): Costa Volpino (0.23 ± 0.43) {\textgreater} Lovere (0.07 ± 0.25) {\textgreater} Castro (0.03 ± 0.18). The chi-square test showed a significant difference in shape, color, and chemical composition frequency in the samples from the three sites. The chemical composition of the microplastics was polyethylene terephthalate (45\%), nylon (20\%), polypropylene (20\%), polyamide resin (10\%), and polyvinyl chloride (5\%). Our data show that the amount of microplastics the zebra mussel accumulated was greater the closer the sampling site to the WWTP. Our findings suggest that the zebra mussel may provide a useful tool to monitor microplastics pollution in lakes.},

Traditional methods rely on physical sampling and morphological identification, which can be problematic when species are in low densities and/or are cryptic. The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a monitoring tool in freshwater systems is becoming increasingly acceptable and widely used for the detection of single species. Here we demonstrate the development and application of standard PCR primers for the detection of two freshwater invasive species which are high priority for monitoring in the UK and elsewhere: the Dreissenid mussels; Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1987) and D. polymorpha (Pallas, 1771). We carried out a rigorous validation process for testing the new primers, including DNA detection and degradation experiments in mesocosms, and a field comparison with traditional monitoring protocols. eDNA from single individuals of both mussel species could be detected within four hours of the start of the mesocosm experiment. In field trials, the two mussel species were detected at all sites where the species are known to be present, and eDNA consistently outperformed traditional kick-net sampling for species detection. These results demonstrate the applicability of standard PCR for eDNA detection of freshwater invasive species.},

Our results show that some estuaries across the region are invaded by multiple zooplankton species and that the geographic extent of invasion is far greater than previously reported for at least five species of copepods: Pseudodiaptomus inopinus, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Oithona davisae, Limnoithona sinensis, Sinocalanus doerrii, and the cladoceran Bosmina coregoni. Some of these species appear to be rapidly spreading across the region, while others have occupied a relatively static geographic range for decades. The copepod, P. inopinus, is by far the most abundant and geographically widespread of these invaders, comprising more than 90\% of all zooplankton abundance at some sites. We propose that the geographic distribution of these invaders is strongly constrained by geomorphic characteristics that define the salinity and mixing regimes in these estuaries, reflecting the strong role that physical forces play in structuring estuarine zooplankton communities.},

	abstract = {Eurasian zebra and quagga mussels were likely introduced to the Laurentian Great Lakes via ballast water release in the 1980s, and their range has since expanded across the US, including some of their southernmost occurrences in Texas. Their spread into the state has resulted in a need to revise previous delimitations of suitable dreissenid habitat. We therefore assessed invasion risk in Texas by 1) predicting distribution of suitable habitat of zebra and quagga mussels using Maxent species distribution models based upon global occurrence and climate data; and 2) refining lake-specific predictions via collection and analysis of physicochemical data. Maxent models predicted a lack of suitable habitat for quagga mussels within Texas. However, models did predict the presence of suitable zebra mussel habitat, with hotspots of suitable habitat occurring along the Red and Sabine Rivers of north and east Texas, as well as patches of suitable habitat in central Texas between the Colorado and Brazos Rivers and extending inland along the Gulf Coast. Although predicted suitable habitat extended further west than in previous models, most of the Texas panhandle, west Texas extending toward El Paso, and the Rio Grande valley were predicted to provide poor zebra mussel habitat suitability. Collection of physicochemical data (i.e., dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductance, and temperature on-site as well as laboratory analysis for Ca, N, and P) from zebra mussel-invaded lakes and a subset of uninvaded but high-risk lakes of North and Central Texas, did not refine model predictions because there was no apparent distinction between invaded and uninvaded lakes. Overall, we demonstrated that while quagga mussels do not appear to represent an invasive threat in Texas, abundant suitable habitat for continuing zebra mussel invasion exists within the state. The threat of continued expansion of this poster-child for negative invasive species impacts warrants further prevention efforts, management, and research.},

Established monitoring methods require the collection or observation of specimens, which is unlikely at the beginning of an invasion when densities are likely to be low. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a highly promising technique for the detection of INNS: particularly during the early stages of an invasion. Here, we compared the use of traditional kick-net sampling with two eDNA approaches (targeted detection using both conventional and quantitative PCR, and passive detection via metabarcoding) for detection of quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis; a high priority INNS, along a density gradient on the River Wraysbury, UK. All three molecular tools outperformed traditional sampling in terms of detection. Conventional PCR and qPCR both had 100\% detection rate in all samples, and outperformed metabarcoding when the target species was at low densities. Additionally, quagga mussel DNA copy number (qPCR) and read count (metabarcoding) had a significant negative relationship with distance from source population. Synthesis and application: All three molecular approaches were more sensitive than traditional kick-net sampling for the detection of the quagga mussel in flowing water, and both qPCR and metabarcoding enabled estimates of relative abundance. Targeted approaches were more sensitive than metabarcoding, but metabarcoding has the advantage of providing information on the wider community, and consequently impacts of INNS.},

	abstract = {This thesis brings together information from three different techniques to provide novel information on the ecology of range-shifting gilthead seabream Sparus aurata in the Northeast Atlantic. My chapters take a systematic look at the ecology of S. aurata around the UK, to help explain the drivers that are facilitating the northwards range-shift. First, I use species distribution modelling to investigate the relative importance of temperature on the current distribution of S. aurata, and how it is likely to affect the species range in the future. I find that northern populations of S. aurata appear to be occupying a very different thermal niche to those in the native range, indicating that either a niche shift has occurred, or that northern populations consist primarily of non-reproducing adults. Although this distinction has important implications for successful management of the species, I also find that climate change is likely to result in a further northward shift by 2050. This climate-driven shift is likely to facilitate reproducing populations in the English Channel and the Celtic Sea, assuming that suitable nursery areas are available. Second, I use otolith microchemistry to identify whether multiple sources are contributing to S. aurata populations in the English Channel. Using a multi-element approach, I find evidence for three sources contributing to S. aurata populations in the Channel that have shared otolith chemistry, and that these are temporally stable. These sources could relate to environments that are either spatially or temporally-discrete. I also find that, although there appears to be some mixing after spawning, the three different sources do not contribute equally to populations in the Channel. This mixing could occur during larval dispersal or subsequent adult movement. The multi-element approach allows speculation as to where these sources could be and provides a basis for future research into identifying specific spawning locations. Finally, I use stable isotopes to investigate the potential consequences of increasing S. aurata populations on European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax, by examining the potential for resource competition between juveniles. I find that although both species appear to be feeding on similar prey, they also appear to have different realised niches within the study system. This apparent resource partitioning could indicate a negative competitive effect or a positive indirect effect through indirect mutualism. To my knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of S. aurata in UK waters. Therefore, this thesis provides useful information that can help inform future management measures and conservation of this target species.},

	abstract = {The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) represents a useful reference organism for the ecotoxicological study of inland waters, especially for the characterization of the disturbances induced by human activities. A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic approach was developed on this species. The investigation of its informative potential required the prior interpretation of a reference 1H NMR spectrum of a lipid-free zebra mussel extract. After the extraction of polar metabolites from a pool of whole-body D. polymorpha powder, the resulting highly complex 1D 1H NMR spectrum was interpreted and annotated through the analysis of the corresponding 2D homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR spectra. The spectrum interpretation was completed and validated by means of sample spiking with 24 commercial compounds. Among the 238 detected 1H signals, 53\% were assigned, resulting in the identification of 37 metabolites with certainty or high confidence, while 5 metabolites were only putatively identified. The description of such a reference spectrum and its annotation are expected to speed up future analyses and interpretations of NMR-based metabolomic studies on D. polymorpha and to facilitate further explorations of the impact of environmental changes on its physiological state, more particularly in the context of large-scale ecological and ecotoxicological studies.},

	abstract = {The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, continues to spread from its native range in Eurasia to Europe and North America, causing billions of dollars in damage and dramatically altering invaded aquatic ecosystems. Despite these impacts, there are few genomic resources for Dreissena or related bivalves, with nearly 450 million years of divergence between zebra mussels and its closest sequenced relative. Although the D. polymorpha genome is highly repetitive, we have used a combination of long-read sequencing and Hi-C-based scaffolding to generate the highest quality molluscan assembly to date. Through comparative analysis and transcriptomics experiments we have gained insights into processes that likely control the invasive success of zebra mussels, including shell formation, synthesis of byssal threads, and thermal tolerance. We identified multiple intact Steamer-Like Elements, a retrotransposon that has been linked to transmissible cancer in marine clams. We also found that D. polymorpha have an unusual 67 kb mitochondrial genome containing numerous tandem repeats, making it the largest observed in Eumetazoa. Together these findings create a rich resource for invasive species research and control efforts.

	abstract = {Tools that bolster early detection of invasive dreissenid mussels are needed to prevent their spread across western North America. In this study, we assessed if environmental DNA (eDNA) can extend the seasonal window for dreissenid mussel early detection beyond that of plankton tows, which are limited to warmer seasons when mussel larvae are present. We focused eDNA sampling efforts at multiple sites in Tiber Reservoir (Montana) where dreissenid mussel abundance is hypothesized to be low. Samples were collected in June and October 2017, when water temperatures were cooler than thermal optima for dreissenid reproduction, and in July 2017 when water temperatures were warmer and conducive for reproduction. We detected dreissenid mussel DNA in June, July and October even though no dreissenid mussels were observed using non-molecular tools in 2017. A subset of positive and negative eDNA samples was analyzed by an independent lab and results were corroborated. We then estimated the effort needed for 95\% probability detection of dreissenid DNA at each site within Tiber Reservoir and found that as many as 27, 14, and 34 samples needed to be collected in June, July and October, respectively. To further validate the utility of eDNA, we also present ancillary eDNA results from other waters in the Flathead Reservation (Montana) where dreissenid mussels have never been detected and from waters with established zebra mussel populations in the upper Mississippi River, which were sampled in the spring when water temperatures were cooler than thermal optima for dreissenid reproduction. All Flathead Reservation samples were negative for dreissenid mussel DNA, while all upper Mississippi River samples were positive. This study adds to a growing body of research that demonstrates eDNA is a highly sensitive tool for dreissenid mussel surveillance in newly invaded waters, including colder seasons when non-molecular tools are likely to be less effective or more challenging to employ.},

	abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an aquatic invasive species that plague much of North America and are difficult to impossible to eradicate once they become established. Therefore, prevention and monitoring are key elements in the control of these organisms. Traditional microscopy is commonly used in monitoring but requires the presence of larval veligers. This limits the times when resource managers can monitor for the presence in northern lakes. A new monitoring tool, environmental DNA (eDNA), may allow for a more efficient and cost-effective monitoring program for zebra mussels. We developed and tested an environmental DNA assay in the fall and spring for zebra mussels in two Minnesota lakes, one heavily infested and another newly infested. We found that DNA copy numbers tended to be higher near the lake bottom and DNA was more concentrated in softer substrates. We also found that the amount of zebra mussel DNA sampling in winter resulted in similar results to when sampled in fall. This suggests that one could collect and analyze eDNA for zebra mussels during winter months to help inform future efforts in monitoring and control.},

	abstract = {Finding suitable places to establish a mussel farm is challenging, as many aspects like mussel growth, clearance effect and the risk of low oxygen conditions, have to be considered. We present a tailor-made approach, combining field experiments with a spatially explicit model tool, to support the planning process. A case study was set up in the German part of Szczecin (Oder) Lagoon (Baltic Sea), as it shows all typical eutrophication problems and has a strong need and high potential for nutrient retention measures. Farming zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) is an innovative approach that utilizes a species which is often perceived as a pest. The practical applicability and water quality improvement potential was proven by a pilot farm. Combining the gained knowledge with the simulation model led to a cascade of mussel farm options that differ in purpose, location and biomass. Placing a mussel farm in an enclosed bay resulted in a remarkable water quality improvement (Secchi Depth increased up to 2 m), but the effect stayed local, the growth was limited and the potential annual nutrient removal reached a threshold of approximately 30 t N and 2.8 t P. The same nutrient removal could be reached with much smaller farms in an open sea area, whereas the change of water transparency or bottom oxygen conditions were neglectable. A maximal nutrient removal potential of 1,750 t N and 160 t P per year was estimated, when nearly the entire German part of Szczecin Lagoon with mussel farms was used. This led to a strong reduction of phytoplankton and an increase of Secchi Depth, but also a rising risk of anoxia. Overall, all mussel farm options are only a supportive measure, but not sufficient to reach the Good Environmental Status demanded by the Water Framework Directive. At once, the nutrient export from Szczecin Lagoon to the open Baltic was reduced by up to 3,500 t N and 420 t P per year, making the large-scale mussel farm option also a potential measure within the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

Different filtering techniques carried out on the banks of the Ebro (EB) and Júcar (JU) rivers (Eastern Spain) in different water conditions are compared. Low volume water filtration from the banks is a method sensitive enough to detect variations in larval density due to water temperature and flow rates. The EB densities were lower and related to the temperature of the water. In JU, different spawning strategies and a much extended period of larval releasing into the water occurred in two consecutive years. The presence of larvae in both rivers was constant for many months of the year, during which various reproductive cycles occurred, facilitated by high water temperatures during mid-spring to late fall. Shoreline surveys can be easily used for allowing the early warning of the presence of this dangerous invasive species, mitigating damages and preventing its spread into new areas. However, it is important to choose a suitable location for capturing the larvae on the banks of reservoirs and in flowing rivers.Alternate abstract: La détection larvaire est la procédure la plus couramment utilisée pour surveiller la présence de la moule zébrée, Dreissena polymorha. Différentes techniques de filtrage réalisées sur les rives de l'Èbre et du Júcar (Est de l'Espagne) dans différentes conditions de rivière et d'eau stagnante (réservoirs) sont comparées. La filtration de l'eau à faible volume à partir des berges est une méthode suffisamment sensible pour détecter les variations de densité larvaire dues à la température de l'eau et aux débits. La présence de larves dans les deux rivières a été constante pendant de nombreux mois de l'année, au cours desquels divers cycles de reproduction se sont produits, facilités par les températures élevées de l'eau du milieu du printemps à la fin de l'automne. Les relevés littoraux peuvent être facilement utilisés pour permettre l'alerte précoce de la présence de cette espèce envahissante dangereuse, atténuant ainsi les dommages et empêchant sa propagation dans de nouvelles zones.

The highly invasive non-native apple snail Pomacea maculata has raised such concerns as it has become established in a wide range of aquatic systems worldwide. While monitoring native Florida P. paludosa populations in Lake Tohopekaliga (LTOHO) from 2001 to 2009 and in Water Conservation Area 3A (WCA3A, Everglades) from 2006 to 2015, we opportunistically documented the establishment and distribution of P. maculata. We estimated snail densities and recorded egg cluster presence in three study sites (12 total plots, LTOHO) and 137 sites (WCA3). On LTOHO, native snails were absent or at very low densities prior to finding P. maculata. Few snails of either species were found in high-stem-density vegetation of the littoral zone. Pomacea maculata immigration into the littoral zone occurred following managed vegetation removal, and Hydrilla verticillata proliferation in LTOHO likely contributed to the spread of P. maculata. We found both native and non-native apple snail species in many WCA3A sites following P. maculata invasion. We initially found the non-native snail in two sites in southern WCA3A; they were mostly restricted to within three kilometers of initial sites over the next four years. Overall plant community compositions in LTOHO and WCA3A appeared less impacted than expected based on previous reports of P. maculata invasions.},

By way of example, in Figure 1 we illustrate anthrax transmission (as an example of environmental transmission) on two landscapes: (1) the scrub habitat of west Texas (left panel), where blow flies [33] and biting flies [34] can increase local case intensity of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) predominantly browsing during the outbreak season; and (2) the grasslands of Etosha National Park in Namibia (Etosha; right panel), where grazing near LIZs during the wet season is the primary mode of transmission [11,12].

In the case of soil-borne B. anthracis, recent studies on the environmental conditions that support pathogen persistence include ecological niche modeling [37,38,39]), host seasonal resource selection in risk areas [40], host foraging behavior at LIZs [11,41], seasonal changes in host diet [12], and seasonal fluctuations in host antibody titers to B. anthracis [42].

[...]in the case of the water-borne bacterium Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, sufficient data exist [26,37,40] to construct strategic models that account for transmission enhancement and seasonal affects through V. cholerae associations with zooplankton [23,24,41,42].},

	abstract = {Methods to reduce the introduction and spread of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) are key to reducing the economic, environmental and social impacts of IAS. IAS propagules can be moved around accidentally on clothing and equipment used in agriculture, transport, trade and recreation. Campaigns to slow the spread of aquatic IAS encourage water users to check, clean and dry their equipment and clothes, using hot water during the cleaning process where feasible. The UK Check Clean Dry biosecurity campaign recommends immersion in hot water (45 °C) for 15 minutes, however, implementation time may be a barrier to adoption of biosecurity practices. Here we aim to refine the advice given and test the efficacy of hot water treatment in actual conditions, with a view to reduce the recommended time to clean equipment while still preventing spread. The effectiveness was tested for a range of temperature (40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 °C) and time (10 seconds, 1, 5, 10, 15 minutes) treatments in killing IAS propagules of two invasive aquatic animal species (Dreissena polymorpha, Dikerogammarus villosus) and two invasive aquatic plant species (Myriophyllum aquaticum, Crassula helmsii), which are of global/national importance. For both invasive animal species, 100\% mortality was achieved at all temperature and time treatments. However, plant mortality was affected by both temperature and time, with higher mortality resulting from higher temperatures and exposure times. Immersion for the recommended 15 mins at 45 °C caused complete mortality of C. helmsii, but only 40\% mortality of M. aquaticum. Immersion in water at 50 °C or higher led to 100\% mortality for C. helmsii and 90\% mortality for M. aquatium at shorter treatment durations of 5 or 10 mins. In addition, immersion in water at 60 °C caused 100\% mortality after only 1 minute exposure. To ensure adoption and application of biosecurity practices, guidance should be simple, consistent and safe. For practical application in field we recommend, where feasible, immersion of equipment in water at 50 °C for a minimum of 5 minutes to achieve high mortality of IAS propagules.},

	abstract = {Early detection is paramount for attempts to remove invasive non-native species (INNS). Traditional methods rely on physical sampling and morphological identification, which can be problematic when species are in low densities and/or are cryptic. The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a monitoring tool in freshwater systems is becoming increasingly acceptable and widely used for the detection of single species. Here we demonstrate the development and application of standard PCR primers for the detection of four freshwater invasive species which are high priority for monitoring in the UK and elsewhere: Dreissenid mussels; Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1987) and D. polymorpha (Pallas, 1771), and Gammarid shrimps; Dikerogammarus villosus (Sowinsky, 1984) and D. haemobaphes (Eichwald, 1843). We carried out a rigorous validation process for testing the new primers, including DNA detection and degradation rate experiments in mesocosm, and a field comparison with traditional monitoring protocols. We successfully detected all four target species in mesocosms, but success was higher for mussels than shrimps. eDNA from single individuals of both mussel species could be detected within four hours of the start of the experiment. By contrast, shrimp were only consistently detected at higher densities (20 individuals). In field trials, the two mussel species and D. haemobaphes were detected at all sites where the species are known to be present, and eDNA consistently outperformed traditional kick sampling for species detection. However, D. villosus eDNA was only detected in one of five sites where the species was confirmed by kick sampling. These results demonstrate the applicability of standard PCR for eDNA detection of freshwater invasive species, but also highlight the importance of differences between taxa in terms of the detection ability.},

We provide a synopsis of key historical milestones for marine bioinvasions, including timelines of (a) discovery and understanding of the invasion process, focusing on transfer mechanisms and outcomes, (b) methodologies used for detection and monitoring, (c) approaches to ecological impacts research, and (d) management and policy responses. Early (until the mid-1900s) marine bioinvasions were given little attention, and in a number of cases actively and routinely facilitated. Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, several conspicuous non-indigenous species outbreaks with strong environmental, economic, and public health impacts raised widespread concerns and initiated shifts in public and scientific perceptions. These high-profile invasions led to policy documents and strategies to reduce the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species, although with significant time lags and limited success and focused on only a subset of transfer mechanisms. Integrated, multi-vector management within an ecosystem-based marine management context is urgently needed to address the complex interactions of natural and human pressures that drive invasions in marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The environmental fate, persistence, and non-target animal impacts of traditional molluscicides for zebra, Dreissena polymorpha, and quagga, D. bugensis, mussel control led to the development of the biomolluscicide Zequanox. Although previous research has demonstrated the specificity of Zequanox, one study indicated sensitivity of salmonids and lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, following non-label compliant exposures to Zequanox. This study was conducted to evaluate sublethal and lethal impacts of Zequanox exposure on juvenile lake sturgeon and lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, following applications that were conducted in a manner consistent with the Zequanox product label. Fish were exposed to 50 or 100 mg/L of Zequanox as active ingredient for 8 h and then held for 33 d to evaluate latent impacts. No acute mortality was observed in either species; however, significant latent mortality (P {\textless} 0.01, df = 9; 46.2\%) was observed in lake trout that were exposed to the highest dose of Zequanox. Statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.03, df = 9), but biologically minimal differences were observed in the weight (range 20.17 to 21.49 g) of surviving lake sturgeon at the termination of the 33 d post-exposure observation period. Statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.05, df = 9) and biologically considerable differences were observed in the weight (range 6.19 to 9.55 g) of surviving lake trout at the termination of the 33 d post-exposure observation period. Histologic evaluation of lake trout gastrointestinal tracts suggests that the mode of action in lake trout is different from the mode of action that induces zebra and quagga mussel mortality. Further research could determine the sensitivity of other salmonid species to Zequanox and determine if native fish will avoid Zequanox treated water.},

	abstract = {In invasive species ecology, risk identification is an essential first step of the overall risk analysis process. In this study, 24 non-native freshwater macroinvertebrate species were screened for their level of risk of invasiveness in the Dnieper, Pripyat and Neman rivers and associated basins of Belarus. Using the recently-developed Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS-ISK), the threshold values of 12.25 for the Basic Risk Assessment (BRA) and 19.5 for the BRA + CCA (Climate Change Assessment) allowed identifying those species likely to be of high risk of invasiveness in the risk assessment area. For the BRA+CCA, the highest-scoring species were zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, spinycheek crayfish Orconectes limosus, quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis and Caspian mud shrimp Chelicorophium curvispinum, and for the BRA only signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus. For all species but one (namely, fragile ancylid Ferrissia fragilis classified as low risk), the CCA resulted in an increase in score relative to the BRA, indicating that predicted future global warming conditions are likely to exacerbate the detrimental impacts of the non-native macroinvertebrates of Ponto-Caspian origin. The present application of AS-ISK confirms the predictive value of the tool, and benefits from incorporation of future climate change scenarios. This is a crucial step for the provision of guidelines for the successful management of non-native invasive species and conservation of native faunas in the (invaded) habitats of Belarus.},

We investigated Trichloris crinita, a native C4 perennial grass with disjunct distribution between subtropical regions of North and South America, testing the hypothesis that the species has a similar realized climatic niche in both subcontinents. The climatic niche of T. crinita in North and South America was characterized and compared using presence records and five uncorrelated bioclimatic variables selected according to their ecological importance for the species. We used reciprocal modeling to make geographic projections of the realized niche within each subcontinent. Niche overlap between T. crinita distributions in North and South America was intermediate for the individual climatic variables and the multivariate space. In all cases the test of equivalence between climates inhabited by T. crinita indicated that the realized niche of the species differ significantly between subcontinents. Also, the similarity test showed that in the majority of cases the realized niche in both subcontinents was significantly different than that expected by chance. T. crinita occupied a greater diversity of environments in South than in North America, while in the latter its distribution was displaced to drier and warmer environments. The modeled geographic distribution using the actual occurrences of the species in North America did not accurately predict the distribution in South America, and vice versa. Together, these results led us to reject the hypothesis of similar niche of T. crinita in both subcontinents. This information may be useful to manage restoration efforts by presenting the suitable areas and climates for the species, and suggesting that translocation of individuals between subcontinents could only be recommended with caution because introduced genotypes can be potentially maladaptive, and could colonize sites actually not occupied by the species within each subcontinent.},

	abstract = {Differential tolerance to stress is partly responsible for the heterogeneity of biomarker responses between populations of a sentinel species. Although currently used for freshwater biomonitoring, studies concerning inter-populational variability in tolerance to contaminants for the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) are scarce. Moreover, this well-known invader is currently replaced by another, the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). To evaluate the differential tolerance between dreissenids, several populations of both species were exposed to a high concentration of nickel. A LT50 (time when 50\% of individuals were dead) was established for each population. Biomarker responses and internal nickel concentration were also measured, to link tolerance with physiological status. Results evidenced that D. polymorpha populations are more heterogeneous and more tolerant than D. r. bugensis ones. For D. polymorpha populations only, LT50 values were positively correlated with the nickel contamination in situ, with higher anti-oxidative defences and a higher Integrated Biomarker Response value in the field. Such findings may be explained by local adaptation and invasion dynamic within each species. The significance of this differential tolerance when using biomarker responses for biomonitoring purposes is thus discussed.},

	abstract = {Alternatives to chemicals for controlling dreissenid mussels are desirable for environmental compatibility, but few alternatives exist. Previous studies have evaluated the use of electrified fields for stunning and/or killing planktonic life stages of dreissenid mussels, however, the available literature on the use of electrified fields to control adult dreissenid mussels is limited. We evaluated the effects of sinusoidal alternating current (AC) and 20\% duty cycle square-wave pulsed direct current (PDC) exposure on the survival of adult zebra mussels at water temperatures of 10, 15, and 22 °C. Peak voltage gradients of {\textasciitilde} 17 and 30 Vp/cm in the AC and PDC exposures, respectively, were continuously applied for 24, 48, or 72 h. Peak power densities ranged from 77,999 to 107,199 µW/cm3 in the AC exposures and 245,320 to 313,945 µW/cm3 in the PDC exposures. The peak dose ranged from 6,739 to 27,298 Joules/cm3 and 21,306 to 80,941 Joules/cm3 in the AC and PDC exposures, respectively. The applied power ranged from 16.6 to 68.9 kWh in the AC exposures and from 22.2 to 86.4 kWh in the PDC exposures. Mortality ranged from 2.7 to 92.7\% in the AC exposed groups and from 24.0 to 98.7\% in PDC exposed groups. Mortality increased with corresponding increases in water temperature and exposure duration, and we observed more zebra mussel mortality in the PDC exposures. Exposures conducted with AC required less of a peak dose (Joules/cm3) but more applied power (kWh) to achieve the same level of adult zebra mussel mortality as corresponding PDC exposures. The results demonstrate that 20\% duty cycle square-wave PDC requires less energy than sinusoidal AC to inducing the same level of adult zebra mussel mortality.},

	abstract = {The Bureau of Reclamation has been monitoring the waters in the western U.S. since 2006 for the presence of dreissenid mussels. Currently, Reclamation has evaluated over 17,000 raw water samples representing over 400 western water bodies. This data includes water bodies where mussels had invaded and control methods were being tested. Primarily however, the program tested western waters for the purposes of tracking the dreissenid mussel invasion. Utilizing the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) program for zebra mussel detection, Reclamation developed a protocol for raw water testing for determination of dreissenid mussel presence in western waters that included microscopy and DNA testing. The results of testing clashed with definitions, and triggered concerns for costly false positives that round robin testing did not substantiate. During that time, a clear understanding of the conflicting test results was not available for the stakeholders and partners participating in the mussel detection program. The large body of data revealed some unique information on the invasion of mussels in the western US; from the way samples were collected and preserved, to the slower than anticipated spread. The Reclamation Detection Laboratory for Exotic Species (RDLES) conducted research looking more closely at the science involved in the detection of invasive mussels in raw water plankton tow net samples. As research revealed information about the lack of microscopic findings, the value of environmental DNA (eDNA) findings for invasive species and mission essential projects became apparent. This article will present an overview of the Reclamation invasive mussel program detection, monitoring, and briefing on some control research activities. RDLES research developments have far-reaching applications for future management activities and decisions with many lessons learned about planktonic sampling from this large body of data and the related discovery of benefits of eDNA testing for numerous species of concern.},

The first experiment tested veliger settlement after exposure to doses of 50, 40 and 20 mJ/cm². The second experiment tested settlement after exposure to 100 mJ/cm², and examined veligers behavior and direct mortality post exposure to UV doses of 100, 50, 40 and 20 mJ/cm². All doses tested in the first experiment resulted in settlement reduction between 88 and 99\%. The 100 mJ/cm² dose reduced settlement by 99\%. In the second experiment delayed veliger mortality was observed after every UV level tested. Mortality varied based on UV dose, ambient water temperature, and veliger size.},

In total, 117717 gobiids were identified and classified. The occurrence of all three species varied strongly between sampling years, and species-specific activity triggers were identified. The activity of juveniles of all three gobiids species was positively temperature dependent while adult tubenose goby activity appeared to be negatively temperature dependent. Increasing fluvial discharge in the adjoining main river stimulated the activity of juvenile round goby but inhibited activity of adult tubenose goby. Except for adult bighead goby, activity was also structured by time of day, but with no uniform mean. Meteorological factors such as precipitation, air pressure and duration of sunshine hours had little or no influence on gobiid activity. On selected rare occasions, mainly at night, all three species exhibited pulsed swarming behaviour, with thousands of individuals recorded in the intake water. Round goby swarms exhibited both the highest intensity and the largest swarming individuals, suggesting a potential competitive advantage over tubenose and bighead goby. Electric fishing surveys in natural river stretches corroborated this observation. Negative effects on the native fish fauna were apparent only for the bullhead, Cottus gobio.
The activity triggers identified offer a unique insight into the invasion mechanisms of these ecosystem-changing non-native gobiids.},

	abstract = {In 2004, Mytella charruana (d'Orbigny, 1842) (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Mytilidae) became established along the coast of the southeastern United States (SE-US). Using mitochondrial DNA sequencing (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I), we compared genetic variation throughout its native range in South America to its invasive range in the SE-US. Samples from the SE-US were collected in 2006 and 2010 enabling a temporal comparison to evaluate possible genetic changes of the invasive population. We addressed two questions. First, what are the potential source populations (or geographic regions) for the SE-US invasion? Second, how has genetic diversity changed between the two sampling periods within the SE-US? We identified a total of 72 haplotypes, 64 of which were isolated to geographic sites and only 8 were shared among sites. The highly structured native range provides insight into the origin of invasive populations where our results suggest that the introduced SE-US population originated from multiple source populations with the Panama region as the primary source. Additionally, our results indicate that genetic composition of the non-native populations was unchanged between the two sampling periods. Mytella charruana exhibit a significant pattern of genetic structure among natural populations, owing to biogeographic barriers that limit natural dispersal, and an ability to persist in novel habitats, owing to a suite of life-history characters that favor survival under variable conditions. Overall, this study explains why M. charruana may become an increasing threat to locations founded by anthropogenic transportation.},

	abstract = {Artificial reefs created by deliberately sinking ships off the coast of the Florida Keys island chain are providing new habitat for marine invertebrates. This newly developing fouling community includes the previously reported invasive orange tube coral Tubastraea coccinea and the non-native giant foam oyster Hyotissa hyotis. New SCUBA-based surveys involving five shipwrecks spanning the upper, middle, and lower Florida Keys, show T. coccinea now also established in the lower Keys and H. hyotis likewise extending to new sites. Two additional mollusks found on the artificial reefs, the amathinid gastropod Cyclothyca pacei and gryphaeid oyster Hyotissa mcgintyi, the latter also common in the natural reef areas, are discussed as potentially non-native. A new species of sessile, suspension-feeding, worm-snail, Thylacodes vandyensis Bieler, Rawlings \& Collins n. sp. (Vermetidae), is described from the wreck of the USNS Vandenberg off Key West and discussed as potentially invasive. This new species is compared morphologically and by DNA barcode markers to other known members of the genus, and may be a recent arrival from the Pacific Ocean. Thylacodes vandyensis is polychromatic, with individuals varying in both overall head-foot coloration and mantle margin color pattern. Females brood stalked egg capsules attached to their shell within the confines of their mantle cavity, and give rise to crawl-away juveniles. Such direct-developing species have the demonstrated capacity for colonizing habitats isolated far from their native ranges and establishing rapidly growing founder populations. Vermetid gastropods are common components of the marine fouling community in warm temperate and tropical waters and, as such, have been tagged as potentially invasive or with a high potential to be invasive in the Pacific Ocean. As vermetids can influence coral growth/composition in the Pacific and have been reported serving as intermediate hosts for blood flukes of loggerhead turtles, such new arrivals in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary are of concern. Growing evidence indicates that artificial reefs can act as permanent way-stations for arriving non-natives, providing nurseries within which populations may grow in an environment with reduced competition compared to native habitats. Consequently, artificial reefs can act as sentinels for the appearance of new species. Ongoing monitoring of the developing molluscan fauna on the artificial reefs of the Florida Keys is necessary to recognize new invasions and identify potential eradication targets, thereby assuring the health of the nearby natural barrier reef.},

	abstract = {Early detection and monitoring of invasive species is important for the development of effective measures directed at minimising the negative effects of invaders. In the early stages of invasion, aquatic invasive species are typically rare and their detection using costly and time-consuming field surveys is often challenging. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods are increasingly applied in freshwater systems to detect and quantify target species with relative ease over large geographic scales and across the invasion fronts. In this study we test eDNA detection and quantification methods for invasive zebra and quagga mussels. Both mussel species have invaded widely in North America and Europe and show strong negative ecosystem-wide impacts. We extracted DNA from filtered water samples which we collected along the Rhine catchment in Switzerland, Germany and The Netherlands, including the known invasion area of the zebra mussel and the invasion front of the quagga mussel. Standard PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods were compared for detection and qPCR was used to quantify the eDNA signal for each species. Our results show that the invasion front of the quagga mussel has moved southwards, including areas where this species had not been detected previously with traditional benthic invertebrate sampling methods. Standard PCR and qPCR showed a similar performance in detecting both mussel species. Moreover, the eDNA quantification of the two species showed low variance within sampling site and matched with expected densities of zebra and quagga mussels based on previous field survey studies. The tested eDNA methods are cost effective and have the potential to be widely applied for the surveillance of zebra and quagga mussels in the future.},

Such models are relatively ``theory-free''. In contrast, theories for explaining species' distributions draw on concepts like fitness, niche, and environmental suitability. This paper proposes that environmental suitability be defined as the conditional probability of occurrence of a species given the state of the environment at a location. Any quantity that is proportional to this probability is a measure of relative suitability and the support of this probability is the niche. This formulation suggests new methods for presence-background modeling of species distributions that unify statistical methodology with the conceptual framework of niche theory. One method, the plug-and-play approach, is introduced for the first time. Variations on the plug-and-play approach were studied with respect to their numerical performance on 106 species from an exhaustively sampled presence/absence survey of vegetation in the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Additionally, we looked at the robustness of these methods to the presence of irrelevant information and sample size. Although irrelevant variables eroded the predictive performance of all methods, these methods were found to be both numerically and statistically robust.},

	abstract = {Vectors that underpin the natural dispersal of invasive alien species are frequently unknown. In particular, the passive dispersal (zoochory) of one organism (or propagule) by another, usually more mobile animal, remains poorly understood. Field observations of the adherence of invasive freshwater bivalves to other organisms have prompted us to assess the importance of zoochory in the spread of three prolific invaders: zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha; quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis; and Asian clam Corbicula fluminea. An extensive, systematic search of the literature was conducted across multiple on-line scientific databases using various search terms and associated synonyms. In total, only five publications fully satisfied the search criteria. It appears that some fish species can internally transport viable adult D. polymorpha and C. fluminea specimens. Additionally, literature indicates that veligers and juvenile D. polymorpha can adhere to the external surfaces of waterbirds. Overall, literature suggests that zoochorous dispersal of invasive bivalves is possible, but likely a rare occurrence. However, even the establishment of a few individuals (or a single self-fertilising C. fluminea specimen) can, over-time, result in a substantial population. Here, we highlight knowledge gaps, identify realistic opportunities for data collection, and suggest management protocols to mitigate the spread of invasive alien species.

IMPORTANCE Freshwater bacteria play fundamental roles in global elemental cycling and are an intrinsic part of local food webs. Human activities are altering freshwater environments, and much has been learned regarding the sensitivity of bacterial assemblages to a variety of these disturbances. Yet, relatively few studies have focused on how species invasion, which is one of the most important aspects of anthropogenic global change, affects freshwater bacterial assemblages. This study focuses on the impact of invasive dreissenid mussels (IDMs), a globally distributed group of invasive species with large impacts on freshwater phyto- and zooplankton assemblages. We show that IDMs have direct effects on lake bacterioplankton abundance, taxonomic composition, and inferred bacterial functional group representation.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is one of the main challenges affecting the globe, with particular implications for the oceans. Marine climate change research has moved forward rapidly in recent years, and a range of physical model outputs are available that can be used by ecologists to help predict how species might be affected into the future. Policy makers require a level of understanding of how certain species and their ranges might change so that they can respond with sustainable management actions. This thesis aims to make use of a number of modelling techniques to explore implications of past and future conditions for marine species, and to appraise those tools that can be used under differing circumstances. Policy questions are answered relating to changes in the abundance and distribution of marine species. The links between historical climatic conditions and Barents Sea cod abundance are explored using Generalised Additive Models using data collected in the middle of the 20th century. This valuable historical data indicated that cod have temperature preferences and expand and shift their distributions based on environmental conditions. A simpler modelling technique is used to examine how oxygen conditions have changed in recent decades in the North Sea, how they might change in the future, and what implications this has for commercial fish species. The models show that oxygen conditions have improved recently and that they will not decrease to levels that result in large negative effects in the coming century. Species distribution modelling using a combination of global and downscaled model outputs shows that the UK will become more suitable for some non-native and harmful algal species in the 21st century, and less suitable for others. The model outputs contribute to the understanding of climate change effects and development of management tools to ensure the resilience of marine ecosystems into the future.},

	abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are known to increase water clarity and affect ecosystem processes in invaded lakes. During the last decade, the conspecific quagga mussels (D. rostriformis bugensis) have displaced zebra mussels in many ecosystems including shallow lakes such as Oneida Lake, New York. In this study, an eight-week mesocosm experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that the displacement of zebra mussels by quagga mussels leads to further decreases in phytoplankton and increases in water clarity resulting in increases in benthic algae. We found that the presence of zebra mussels alone (ZM), quagga mussels alone (QM), or an equal number of both species (ZQ) reduced total phosphorus (TP) and phytoplankton Chl a. Total suspended solids (TSS) was reduced in ZM and ZQ treatments. Light intensity at the sediment surface was higher in all three mussel treatments than in the no-mussel controls but there was no difference among the mussel treatments. There was no increase in benthic algae biomass in the mussel treatments compared with the no-mussel controls. Importantly, there was no significant difference in nutrient (TP, soluble reactive phosphorus and NO3-) levels, TSS, phytoplankton Chl a, benthic algal Chl a, or light intensity on the sediment surface between ZM, QM and ZQ treatments. These results confirm the strong effect of both mussel species on water clarity and indicate that the displacement of zebra mussel by an equivalent biomass of quagga mussel is not likely to lead to further increases in water clarity, at least for the limnological conditions, including summer temperature, tested in this experiment.},

This paper provides a summary of the development of new indicators and refinement of existing ones in order to address some of the observed gaps in indicator availability for marine biodiversity assessments considering genetic, species, habitat, and ecosystem levels. Promising new indicators are available addressing genetic diversity of microbial and benthic communities. Novel indicators to assess biodiversity and food webs associated with habitats formed by keystone species (such as macroalgae) as well as to map benthic habitats (such as biogenic reefs) using high resolution habitat characterization were developed. We also discuss the advances made on indicators for detecting impacts of non-native invasive species and assessing the structure and functioning of marine food-webs. The latter are based on indicators showing the effects of fishing on trophic level and size distribution of fish and elasmobranch communities well as phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure as food web indicators. New and refined indicators are ranked based on quality criteria). Their applicability for various EU and global biodiversity assessments and the need for further development of new indicators and refinement of the existing ones is discussed.},

	abstract = {Natural resource managers are seeking appropriate chemical eradication and control protocols for infestations of zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1769), and quagga mussels. D. rostiformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1897) that have limited effect on non-target species. Applications of low concentrations of potassium salt (as potash) have shown promise for use where the infestation and treatment can be contained or isolated. To further our understanding of such applications and obtain data that could support a pesticide registration, we conducted studies of the acute and chronic toxicity of potassium chloride to dreissenid mussels in four different water sources from infested and non-infested locations (ground water from northern Idaho, surface water from the Snake River, Idaho, USA, surface water from Lake Ontario, Ontario, Canada, and surface water from the Colorado River, Arizona, USA). We found short term exposure of veligers ({\textless} 24 h) to concentrations of 960 mg/L KCl produced rapid mortality in water from three locations, but veligers tested in Colorado River water were resistant. We used probit models to compare the mortality responses, predicted median lethal times and 95\% confidence intervals. In separate experiments, we explored the sensitivity of byssal stage mussels in chronic exposures ({\textgreater}29 d) at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/L KCl. Rapid mortality occurred within 10 d of exposure to concentrations of 200 mg/L KCl, regardless of water source. Kaplan-Meier estimates of mean survival of byssal mussels in 100 mg/L KCl prepared in surface water from Idaho and Lake Ontario were 4.9 or 6.9 d, respectively; however, mean survival of mussels tested in the Colorado River water was {\textgreater} 23 d. The sodium content of the Colorado River water was nearly three times that measured in waters from the other locations, and we hypothesized sodium concentrations may affect mussel survival. To test our hypothesis, we supplemented Snake River and Lake Ontario water with NaCl to equivalent conductivity as the Colorado River, and found mussel survival increased to levels observed in tests of veliger and byssal mussels in Colorado River water. We recommend KCl disinfection and eradication protocols must be developed to carefully consider the water quality characteristics of treatment locations.},

	abstract = {The young field of invasion biology - initially a branch of ecology and conservation biology - has greatly expanded, particularly in the last two and a half decades or so. As a result, the potential negative effects of introduced species have been widely advertised and sometimes, perhaps, overemphasized. This book attempts to restore some balance to the current debate over the role of non-native species, by offering a broader perspective, and taking a longer term, evolutionary look at these species and their impact in their new environments. The relatively arbitrary nature of terms such as "native" and "non-native", and the rather inconsistent ways in which such terms are applied to biological species, as well as the subjective boundaries of so-called "native ranges" are analyzed. The role of non-native species in their new environments can be considerably more complex than the anti-introduced species information would often suggest. Thus, the more positive and nuanced perspective on introduced species and their impact offered in this book is much needed and long overdue.},

Discussion: Individuals at higher stress levels appear to be less discriminating in diet, likely because of abiotic forcing, which decreases both consumer mobility and the availability of a preferred resource. Abiotic stress might be expected to increase trophic variation in other selective dietary generalist species. Where this coincides with a lower physiological condition may be a direct factor in setting their range limit.},

I also compare present-day forms to ancestral forms (both fossil and midden) in order assess phenotypic differences across time and space in two intertidal gastropods with different expansion histories following the Last Glacial Maximum. In Chapter 2, Latitudinal and microgeographic clines under plastic control in two Nucella rocky shore gastropods, I assess the relative contribution of plasticity to the phenotypic differences I find across wave-exposure and latitudinal gradients in Nucella lamellosa  and Nucella ostrina by raising northern and southern populations from different wave-exposure levels under identical conditions and measuring phenotypic variation in the second generation. Finally, in Chapter 3, Bivalve invasions are asymmetrical in geography and niche expansion, we explore the prevalence of niche expansion and the factors that promote invasion success in a set of 120 alien bivalves.},

Location data were obtained from museum specimens, wildlife rehabilitation centers, a roadkill database, and research-grade citizen observations. Ecological niche models were created with Maxent, while range and habitat suitability maps were produced with ArcGIS software. Populations of eastern gray squirrels are currently concentrated around Sacramento, the San Francisco Bay, Monterey, and Bellota. The highest priority areas for control and eradication are areas of western gray squirrel habitat near existing eastern gray squirrel populations, including both peninsulas of the San Francisco Bay, areas near Santa Cruz, Oakland, Santa Rosa, and the Monterey Peninsula.},

	abstract = {The risk of quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis Andrusov 1897) establishment into water-bodies of the western US has expanded the geographic concern regarding the ecological and economic impacts this species will have in aquatic ecosystems. Thresholds based on calcium concentrations, an element critical for mussel growth and physiology, have been used as a primary predictor of quagga mussel establishment success to aid management decisions. We evaluated the invasion potential of quagga mussels in low calcium waters using laboratory experiments to compare the survival, growth and reproductive potential of adult mussels held for 90 days at low (9 and 12 ppm), moderate (15 to 32 ppm) and high (72 ppm) calcium water concentrations. In conjunction with adult experiments, veliger stage survival, growth and settlement were evaluated under similar low, moderate, and high calcium water treatments. Adult mussels survived, grew and showed reproductive potential in low calcium water (12 ppm). Veligers were also able to survive, grow and settle in low calcium water. Higher levels of natural seston biomass appeared to improve adult mussel life history performance in low calcium water. Survival curve analysis predicted that 99\% adult mortality could occur in {\textless}170 days at 9 ppm and 12 ppm, however water with {\textgreater}15 ppm could have adults surviving more than a year. The results from these bioassays provide further evidence that quagga mussels have higher risk of establishment in low calcium lakes if habitats exist that have slightly elevated calcium. These results should help emphasize the vulnerability of water-body in the 12 to 15 ppm calcium range that could potentially be at risk of establishing sustainable quagga mussel populations. Furthermore, these results provide insights into the uncertainty of using a single parameter in assigning establishment risk given the complexity of variables in specific water-bodies that influence life history performance of introduced species.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien aquatic species, including marine and freshwater macroinvertebrates, have become increasingly important in terms of both environmental and socio-economic impacts. In order to assess their environmental and economic costs, we applied the Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS) and performed a comparison with other taxa of invaders in Europe. Impacts were scored into six environmental and six socio-economic categories, with each category containing five impact levels. Among 49 aquatic macroinvertebrates, the most impacting species were the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis (Milne-Edwards, 1853) and the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771). The highest impacts found per GISS impact category were, separately; on ecosystems, through predation, as competitors, and on animal production. Eleven species have an impact score {\textgreater} 10 (high impact) and seven reach impact level 5 in at least one impact category (EU blacklist candidates), the maximum score that can be given is 60 impact points. Comparisons were drawn between aquatic macroinvertebrates and vertebrate invaders such as fish, mammals and birds, as well as terrestrial arthropods, revealing invasive freshwater macroinvertebrates to be voracious predators of native prey and damaging to native ecosystems compared with other taxa. GISS can be used to compare these taxa and will aid policy making and targeting of invasive species for management by relevant agencies, or to assist in producing species blacklist candidates.},

	abstract = {Restricting the spread of invasive quagga and zebra mussels by decontaminating recreational watercraft is an important management practice in Europe and the United States. These mussels impact freshwater ecosystems and leave massive economic costs of restoration for ecological services and human infrastructure for each water body they invade. The authors investigated, at the request of the California Department of Fish and Game, whether decontaminating watercraft by placement into saline waters after coming into contact with freshwater bodies infested with invasive mussels eliminates the risk of spreading the species. Evaluating whether or not this is a viable management practice is critical where zebra and quagga mussel freshwater habitats are directly connected to brackish and saline water bodies, like the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (Delta), California United States of American (USA). In this study, quagga mussels were exposed to water collected from different locations within the Delta, with salinities ranging from 4 parts per thousand (ppt) to 33.4 ppt for up to fifteen days. We observed a mortality gradient correlating to salinity levels. The water with the highest salinity content killed 100\% of the quagga mussels within 40 hours. One hundred percent mortality was not observed until 70 hours of exposure for quagga mussels exposed to lower salinity concentrations of 21.3 ppt and 15.3 ppt. However, 99\% of mussels exposed to 4.0 ppt salinity brackish water remained alive for the 16 day duration of the study. These results are similar to mussels held in water with low salinity content similar to most freshwaters. In the Delta, salinity fluctuates naturally and travel time by boat between saline and freshwaters is a few hours or less. Therefore, it would be challenging if not impossible for watercraft operators to ensure the proper exposure time and salinity exposure. Based on these results, the authors do not recommend launching boats into salt water or brackish water prior to entry into freshwater as a decontamination option for watercraft or as a management tool for preventing invasive mussel infestations.},

	abstract = {The tunicate Ciona intestinalis is an opportunistic invader with high potential for causing economic losses in aquaculture centers. Recent phylogenetic and population genetic analysis support the existence of a genetic complex described as C. intestinalis with two main dominant species (sp A and B) occurring worldwide. In Chile, the species has been observed around 30o S of latitude, but no official reports exist for the presence of C. intestinalis in southern regions (above 40o S), where most of the mollusk aquaculture centers are located. Here, we used occurrences from multiple invaded regions and extensive field sampling to model and validate the environmental conditions that allow the species to persist and to find the geographic areas with the most suitable environmental conditions for the spread of C. intestinalis in the Chilean coast. By studying the potential expansion of C. intestinalis southward in the Chilean Coast, we aimed to provide valuable information that might help the development of control plans before the species becomes a significant problem, especially above 40o S. Our results highlight that, by using portions of the habitat that are apparently distinguishable, the species seem to be not only genetically distinct, but ecologically distinct as well. The two regional models fitted for sp A and for sp B showed disagreement on which sections of Chilean coastline are considered more suitable for these species. While the model for sp A identifies moderately to highly suitable areas between 30o and 40o S, the model for sp B classifies the areas around 45o S as the most appropriate. Data from field sampling show a positive linear relationship between density of C. intestinalis and the index of suitability for sp A in aquaculture centers. Understanding the relation of the distinct species with the surrounding environment provided valuable insights about probable routes of dispersion in Chile, especially into those areas considered suitable for aquaculture activities but where the species has not yet been recorded. We discuss the implications of our findings as a useful tool to anticipate the invasion of such harmful invasive species with regard to the most relevant environmental variables.},

This is another step forward in our ongoing efforts against invasive mussels, said Mary Polak, Minister of Environment.


The new resources mean an additional three mobile inspection and decontamination crews will be dedicated to stopping and ensuring boats are free of mussels. The teams will be based in Cranbrook, Valemount and Nelson, to target major entry points from Alberta and the U.S. The new teams join three other crews that are already operational, doubling the number of mobile units dedicated to protecting B.C.s lakes and rivers against the threat of quagga and zebra mussels.


Aquatic invasive species, such as zebra and quagga mussels, pose a significant threat to Canadas freshwater ecosystems and critical infrastructure such as hydroelectric and drinking water facilities. No zebra or quagga mussels have ever been found in B.C. waterways, and the Province is hard at work ensuring it stays that way.},

We compiled and analyzed a database of natural history and ecological traits of 138 coastal marine invertebrate species, the environmental conditions at sites to which they have been introduced, and their date of first introduction. We found that time since introduction explained the largest fraction (20\%) of the variability in non-native range size, while traits of the species and environmental variables had significant, but minimal, influence on non-native range size. The positive relationship between time since introduction and range size indicates that non-native marine invertebrate species are not at equilibrium and are still spreading, posing a major challenge for management of coastal ecosystems.},

In the present study, germicidal ultraviolet light (UV-C) was used to target the larval stage of wild-caught quagga mussel. The lethal effect of UV-C was evaluated at four different doses, 0.0, 13.1, 26.2, and 79.6 mJ/cm2. Tested doses were determined based on results from preliminary trials.

	abstract = {Invasive species can affect the function and structure of natural ecological communities, hence understanding and predicting their potential for spreading is a major ecological challenge. Once established in a new region, the spread of invasive species is largely controlled by their dispersal capacity, local environmental conditions and species interactions. The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is native to the Mediterranean and is the most successful marine invader in southern Africa. Its distribution there has expanded rapidly and extensively since the 1970s, however, over the last decade its spread has ceased. In this study, we coupled broad scale field surveys, Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) and Lagrangian Particle Simulations (LPS) to assess the current invaded distribution of M. galloprovincialis in southern Africa and to evaluate what prevents further spread of this species. Results showed that all environmentally suitable habitats in southern Africa have been occupied by the species. This includes rocky shores between Rocky Point in Namibia and East London in South Africa (approx. 2800 km) and these limits coincide with the steep transitions between cool-temperate and subtropical-warmer climates, on both west and southeast African coasts. On the west coast, simulations of drifting larvae almost entirely followed the northward and offshore direction of the Benguela current, creating a clear dispersal barrier by advecting larvae away from the coast. On the southeast coast, nearshore currents give larvae the potential to move eastwards, against the prevalent Agulhas current and beyond the present distributional limit, however environmental conditions prevent the establishment of the species. The transition between the cooler and warmer water regimes is therefore the main factor limiting the northern spread on the southeast coast; however, biotic interactions with native fauna may also play an important role.},

Once this species has been introduced to a new area, individuals form dense aggregations that are very difficult to remove, leading to many adverse socioeconomic and ecological consequences. In this study, we identified, tested, and validated a new set of polymorphic microsatellite loci (also known as SSRs, Single Sequence Repeats) using a Massive Parallel Sequencing (MPS) platform. After several pruning steps, 93 SSRs could potentially be amplified. Out of these SSRs, 14 were polymorphic, producing a polymorphic yield of 15.05\%. These 14 polymorphic microsatellites were fully validated in a first approximation of the genetic population structure of D. polymorpha in the Iberian Peninsula.

	abstract = {Effective monitoring, prevention and impact mitigation of nonindigenous aquatic species (NAS) relies upon the ability to predict dispersal pathways and receiving habitats with the greatest risk of establishment. To examine mechanisms affecting species establishment within a large lake, we combined observations of recreational boater movements with empirical measurements of habitat suitability represented by nearshore wave energy to assess the relative risk (RR) of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) establishment. The model was evaluated using information from a 17 year (1995-2012) sequence of M. spicatum presence and absence monitoring. M. spicatum presence was not specifically correlated with recreational boater movements; however its establishment appears to be limited by wave action in Lake Tahoe. Of the sites in the "High" risk category (n=37), 54\% had current or historical infestations, which included 8 of the 10 sites with the highest RR. Of the 11 sites in the "Medium" risk category, 5 had current or historical M. spicatum populations. Most (76\%) of the sites in the "Low" risk category were observed in locations with higher wave action. Four sites that received zero boater visits from infested locations were occupied by M. spicatum. This suggests that the boater survey either represents incomplete coverage of boater movement, or other processes, such as the movement of propagules by surface currents or introductions from external sources are important to the establishment of this species. This study showed the combination of habitat specific and dispersal data in a relative risk framework can potentially reduce uncertainty in estimates of invasion risk.},

The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America have been dramatically altered by such invasions, especially zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (D. rostriformis bugensis) mussels. Responses to mussel invasions have included increased water clarity, and decreased chlorophyll and phytoplankton abundance. Although not all systems have responded similarly, in general, mussels have changed nutrient dynamics and physical habitat conditions. Therefore examination of different impacts can help us further understand mechanisms that underlie ecosystem responses to biological invasions. To aid our understanding of ecosystem impacts, we sampled established locations along a well-studied trophic gradient in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, after the 1993 zebra mussel invasion. A strong trophic gradient remained during the period sampled after the mussel invasion (2000-2012). However, mean summer chlorophyll increased and other measures of phytoplankton biomass (microscope and electronic cell counting) did not change significantly. Multivariate analyses of phytoplankton community structure demonstrate a significant community shift after the invasion. Cyanobacteria increased in dominance, with Microcystis becoming the major summer taxon in lower Green Bay. Diatom diversity and abundance also increased and Chlorophyta became rare. Phytoplankton responses along the trophic gradient of Green Bay to zebra mussel invasion highlight the importance of mussel effects on nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton diversity and function.},

Model predictions for Eurasian Ruffe have been used to direct surveillance efforts within the Great Lakes and DNA evidence of ruffe presence was recently reported from one of three high risk port localities identified by our model. Predictions made for killer shrimp and golden mussel suggest that these two species have the potential to become rapidly widespread if introduced to the Great Lakes, reinforcing the need for proactive ballast water management.

	abstract = {The presence of the North American Marmorkrebs (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis) in European inland waters is entirely driven by ongoing propagule pressure from the ornamental trade. Since 2003 at least 25 independent introduction events have been confirmed, of which some have eventually resulted in established populations. This study links a maximum-entropy model that forecasts the probability of Marmorkrebs introduction based on socio-economic predictors to an updated species distribution model based on environmental predictors in order to explore the risk of further Marmorkrebs establishment in Europe. In line with related research, the probability of Marmorkrebs release was largely affected by gross domestic product and human population density, i.e. predictors very likely related to the density of Marmorkrebs owners, whereas environmental suitability was mostly influenced by minimum temperature and the availability of lentic habitats, which was indirectly assessed by terrain slope. While considerable parts of Europe were predicted as potentially suitable for establishment, high probabilities of introduction were forecasted in much smaller geographic areas. The consensus map of the model predictions suggests that introduction and subsequent establishment of Marmorkrebs is likely to occur in much of Germany, the Benelux countries, England, Italy, and areas of high human population density throughout France and Spain, as well as parts of southernmost Scandinavia and Southeastern Europe. Monitoring trades of Marmorkrebs in these high-risk regions is recommended and implications for proactive measures are discussed, including the need for consistent trade regulations at the EU level.},

	abstract = {With increasing human use of North American inland lakes for recreational purposes, there is a greater probability of the incidental transfer and introduction of aquatic invasive species within them. This raises concern over the potential ecological and economic impacts that invasive species could have in these highly valued freshwater ecosystems. In this study, we focus our interests on 63 inland lakes distributed across the Southern Ontario landscape in order to evaluate whether concerns are warranted over potential adverse impacts of a well-known aquatic invasive species (the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)) on native fish assemblages and targeted game species (i.e., walleye (Sander vitreus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and northern pike (Esox lucius)). Through the analysis of a comprehensive and multivariate dataset comprising lake morphometric, water chemistry, fish assemblage, fish metric, and zooplankton haul data, we examined the potential consequences of zebra mussel invasions in inland lakes. It was found that condition, growth, and relative abundance of some of the most highly valued game fish in inland lakes significantly varies among lakes with and without zebra mussel, though the nature of such effects differed for each of the fish species examined. In addition, it was shown that the species composition (i.e., identity and relative abundance) of active, large-bodied fish assemblages within a lake can indicate zebra mussel presence/absence with a high degree of certainty. Finally, while correlations between zebra mussel presence and the richness, abundance, growth, and condition of certain fish species were found, the results of this study indicate that the potential consequences of this well-known aquatic invader to fisheries in inland lakes may be less dramatic than those reported within the Great Lakes.},

Zequanox® is a natural product comprised of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain CL145A, which effectively controls zebra and quagga mussels. The objective of this study was to demonstrate an effective method of zebra mussel control in inland waterways using Zequanox. Water quality was monitored to determine any negative impacts and to observe product dispersion. A curtain made of an impermeable material was placed in the Grand Canal at Tullamore Harbour sealing off two 8 x 0.5 m sections of canal wall under the bridge, and a control site was chosen further down the docking area. Both sections were treated with Zequanox at a concentration of 150 mg active substance/L for an 8 hour treatment period. Water quality was monitored in the treatment area and in the selected control area before, during, and after treatment. Naturally settled and seeded adult zebra mussels were observed for mortality in the treatment and control areas and juveniles were monitored for survival in both the treatment and control areas. Naturally settled adult mussel numbers were reduced by approximately 46\% in treatment side 1, and 65\% in treatment side 2, seeded adult mussel mortality reached 75\% in treatment side 1 and 56\% in treatment side 2. These results demonstrate that under the optimum conditions Zequanox effectively controls zebra mussels in open water.},

While the aquatic plant can offer a food source and habitable location for some fish and invertebrates, Eurasian water milfoil is quick to become problematic. Rapid growth results in thick floating mats of the plant that prohibit light from penetrating the water body. Dissolved oxygen levels are reduced as the Eurasian water milfoil decomposes. These circumstances limit the growth of native beneficial aquatic plants and animals, reducing biodiversity.


Eurasian water milfoil, quagga mussels, and zebra mussels are just three examples of invasive species to watch for in our province.

We conducted a detailed historical analysis of the mollusc community of Oneida Lake based on our comprehensive lakewide study in 2012 and previous surveys dating back to 1915. In the early 20th century, the lake had a high water clarity, with abundant macrophytes and benthic algae, and hosted the most diverse molluscan community in New York State, including 32 gastropod and 9 unionid species. By the 1960s, lake turbidity increased during a period of anthropogenic eutrophication, resulting in a 38\% decline in species richness and a 95\% reduction in abundance of native gastropods grazing on benthic algae. Following the invasion of Dreissena spp. in 1991 and subsequent increases in water clarity, native gastropod species richness expanded by 37\% and abundance increased 20-fold by 2012. In contrast, filter-feeding unionids were unaffected by increased turbidity during the period of eutrophication but were extirpated by dreissenids. Through contrasting effects on turbidity, eutrophication and Dreissena spp. have likely driven the observed changes in native grazing gastropods by affecting the abundance of light-limited benthic algae. Given the high species richness and ecological importance of benthic grazers, monitoring and managing turbidity is important in preserving molluscan diversity.},

	abstract = {Tanzania's Ruaha landscape is an international priority area for large carnivores, supporting over 10\% of the world's lions and important populations of leopards and spotted hyaenas. However, lack of ecological data on large carnivore distribution and habitat use hinders the development of effective carnivore conservation strategies in this critical landscape. Therefore, the study aimed to (i) identify the most significant ecogeographical variables influencing the potential distribution of lions, leopards and spotted hyaenas across the Ruaha landscape; (ii) identify zones with highest suitability for harbouring those species; and (iii) use species distribution modelling algorithms (SDMs) to define important areas for conservation of large carnivores. Habitat suitability was calculated based on environmental features from georeferenced presence-only carnivore location data. Potential distribution of large carnivores appeared to be strongly influenced by water availability; highly suitable areas were situated close to rivers and experienced above average annual precipitation. Net primary productivity and tree cover also exerted some influence on habitat suitability. All three species showed relatively narrow niche breadth and low tolerance to changes in habitat characteristics. From 21,050 km2 assessed, 8.1\% (1,702 km2) emerged as highly suitable for all three large carnivores collectively. Of that area, 95.4\% (1,624 km2) was located within 30 km of the Park-village border, raising concerns about human-carnivore conflict. This was of particular concern for spotted hyaenas, as they were located significantly closer to the Park boundary than lions and leopards. This study provides the first map of potential carnivore distribution across the globally important Ruaha landscape, and demonstrates that SDMs can be effective for understanding large carnivore habitat requirements in poorly sampled areas. This approach could have relevance for many other important wildlife areas that only have limited, haphazard presence-only data, but which urgently require strategic conservation planning.},

	abstract = {Invasive non-native species (INNS) endanger native biodiversity and are a major economic problem. The management of pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment is a key target in the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi biodiversity targets for 2020. Freshwater environments are particularly susceptible to invasions as they are exposed to multiple introduction pathways, including non-native fish stocking and the release of boat ballast water. Since many freshwater INNS and aquatic pathogens can survive for several days in damp environments, there is potential for transport between water catchments on the equipment used by recreational anglers and canoeists. To quantify this biosecurity risk, we conducted an online questionnaire with 960 anglers and 599 canoeists to investigate their locations of activity, equipment used, and how frequently equipment was cleaned and/or dried after use. Anglers were also asked about their use and disposal of live bait. Our results indicate that 64\% of anglers and 78.5\% of canoeists use their equipment/boat in more than one catchment within a fortnight, the survival time of many of the INNS and pathogens considered in this study and that 12\% of anglers and 50\% of canoeists do so without either cleaning or drying their kit between uses. Furthermore, 8\% of anglers and 28\% of canoeists had used their equipment overseas without cleaning or drying it after each use which could facilitate both the introduction and secondary spread of INNS in the UK. Our results provide a baseline against which to evaluate the effectiveness of future biosecurity awareness campaigns, and identify groups to target with biosecurity awareness information. Our results also indicate that the biosecurity practices of these groups must improve to reduce the likelihood of inadvertently spreading INNS and pathogens through these activities.},

The lake was divided into three assessment units: the north lake, the south lake and a river section situated downstream of the two lake assessment units. Survey work was conducted as a single survey in September 2011. Following an evaluation of the mussel abundance and distribution range within each assessment unit, the Biological Pollution Level (BPL) was calculated. Additional environmental information was obtained from historical monitoring conducted by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency. The zebra mussel was rated as having a high abundance and distribution range in one lake assessment unit, was absent in the second lake assessment unit, and had a low abundance and distribution range for the river assessment unit. Ninety-three stations were surveyed in two and a half days illustrating a practical approach to monitoring which can meet legislative requirements.},

As a result, the registry will serve as a basis for developing effective, cross-boundary strategies to manage and control non-native species, which can have severe ecological and economic impacts.

Additionally, mussels from both populations were exposed to polluted wastewater in the laboratory for three days, and DNA damage was analyzed to evaluate acclimatization and genetic adaptation of the investigated populations to the polluted environment.  The two populations differed in their genetic constitution. Microsatellite analysis suggested that Dp had undergone a genetic bottleneck. Comet assay did not indicate any difference in DNA damage between the two populations, but MNT revealed that Dp had an increased percentage of micronuclei in hemocytes in comparison to Cl. The laboratory experiment revealed that Dp had a lower percentage of tail DNA and a higher percentage of micronuclei than Cl. These differences between populations were possibly caused by an overall decreased fitness of Dp due to genetic drift and by an enhanced DNA repair mechanism due to acclimatization to pollution in the source habitat.},

	abstract = {Cascading trophic interactions are often defined as the indirect effects of a predator on primary producers through the effect of the predator on herbivores. These effects can be both direct through removal of herbivores [density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs)] or indirect through changes in the behavior of the herbivores [trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs)]. How the relative importance of these two indirect interactions varies with predator diversity remains poorly understood. We tested the effect of predator diversity on both TMIIs and DMIIs on phytoplankton using two competitive invasive dreissenid mussel species (zebra mussel and quagga mussel) as the herbivores and combinations of one, two or all three species of the predators pumpkinseed sunfish, round goby, and rusty crayfish. Predators had either direct access to mussels and induced both TMII and DMII, or no direct access and induced only TMII through the presence of risk cues. In both sets of treatments, the predators induced a trophic cascade which resulted in more phytoplankton remaining with predators present than with only mussels present. The trophic cascade was weaker in three-predator and two-predator treatments than in one-predator treatments when predators had direct access to dreissenids (DMIIs and TMIIs). Crayfish had higher cascading effects on phytoplankton than both pumpkinseed and round goby. Increased predator diversity decreased the strength of DMIIs but had no effect on the strength of TMIIs. The strength of TMIIs was higher with zebra than quagga mussels. Our study suggests that inter-specific interference among predators in multi-species treatments weakens the consumptive cascading effects of predation on lower trophic levels whereas the importance of predator diversity on trait mediated effects depends on predator identity.},

	abstract = {Of the 7,000 estimated non-native species present in North America, approximately 1,000 are invasive. Clearly, invasive species are in the minority, but their small numbers don't keep them from causing billions of dollars in economic and ecological harm each year. Policymakers and ecologists continue to try to figure out which species might be harmful, which invasive species are doing the most damage, and which of these might respond best to eradication efforts. Invasive species reports and case studies are prevalent in political, environmental, and scientific news cycles, and a significant portion of the public is concerned about the issue. In Invasive Species: What Everyone Needs to Know®, Simberloff will first cover basic topics such as how non-native species are introduced, which areas have incurred the most biological invasions, and how the rates of biological invasions have shifted in recent years. He then moves on to the direct and indirect impacts of the impacts of invasive species on various ecosystems, such as habitat and resource competition, how invasive species transmit pathogens, and how introduced plants and animals can modify a habitat to favor other non-native species. Simberloff's final chapters will discuss the evolution of invasive species, the policies we currently have in place to manage them, and future prospects for controlling their spread. The book will also contain a section dedicated to the more controversial topics surrounding invasive species: invasive natives, useful non-native species, animal rights versus species rights, and non-native species' impacts on the biodiversity of an ecosystem.

	abstract = {Two field experiments were carried out using a custom built flow-through laboratory to test the effect of elevated pH on dreissenid mussels as a potential control method. Both experiments tested the ability of dreissenid pediveligers to settle under conditions of elevated pH and the long-term survival of adult dreissenids under the same conditions. The two experimental sites had different water quality and different species of dreissenids present. The settlement of quagga mussel pediveligers at the lower Colorado River was inhibited with increasing pH. At the maximum achieved pH of 9.1, there was approximately 90\% reduction compared to the maximum settlement observed in the controls. Since the settlement was almost as low in pH 8.9 as at pH 9.1, the inhibition in settlement may have been due to the presence of a precipitate formed under high pH conditions rather than the increase in background pH. No mortality of quagga mussel adults was observed in the experimental pH levels at the lower Colorado River. At San Justo Reservoir, zebra mussel settlement decreased with increasing pH. New settlement was almost entirely absent at the highest pH tested (pH 9.6). The observed mortality of adult zebra mussels was low, but did tend to increase with increasing pH. We also tested the response of adult zebra mussels to short-term exposure to very high pH levels (i.e. pH 10, 11, and 12). Adult mussels in poor physical condition experienced 90\% mortality after 12 hours at pH 12. For unstressed adult zebra mussels, 90\% mortality was reached after 120 hours at pH 12. Significant mortalities were also observed both at pH 10 and pH 11. From this study, we conclude that pH elevation could be used both as a preventative treatment to eliminate settlement by dreissenid mussels and as an end of season treatment to eliminate adults. The high pH treatment would have to be tailored to the site water quality to prevent formation of precipitate during treatment and to minimize corrosive action on materials of construction.},

Zequanox® is a newly commercialised microbial biocide for zebra and quagga mussels comprised of killed Pseudomonas fluorescens CL145A cells. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of a developmental formulation of Zequanox (referred to as MBI 401 FDP) and chlorine treatments on adult and juvenile zebra mussels by running a biobox trial in conjunction with chlorine treatments at an infested Irish drinking water treatment plant. Since 2009, the plant management has used a residual chlorine concentration of 2 mg/L in autumn to control both adult zebra mussels and juvenile settlement in their three concrete raw water chambers. Juvenile mussel settlement was monitored in three bioboxes as well as in three treatment chambers in the plant for three months prior to treatment. Adult mussels were seeded into the chambers and bioboxes four days before treatment. In October 2011, the bioboxes were treated with MBI 401 FDP at 200 mg active substance/L, while chlorine treatment took place in the water chambers. The MBI 401 FDP treatment lasted only 8 hours while chlorine treatment lasted seven days. Juvenile numbers were reduced to zero in both the bioboxes and treated chambers within seven days. Adult mussel mortality reached 80\% for both the chlorine and MBI 401 FDP treatment; however, mortality was achieved faster in the chlorine treatment. These results provided important insights into zebra mussel control alternatives to chlorine and supported further development of the now commercial product, Zequanox.},

Invasive species negatively impact native species through predation and competition for limited resources. The impacts of invasive species may be increased in habitats where habitat degradation is higher due to reductions of prey abundance and distribution. Using stable isotope analyses and extensive measurements of resource availability we determined how resource availability impacts the long term carbon and nitrogen assimilation of the invasive red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) and a native, threatened species, the red-bellied turtle (Pseudemys rubriventris) at two different freshwater wetland complexes in Pennsylvania, USA. At a larger wetland complex with greater vegetative species richness and diversity, our stable isotope analyses showed dietary niche partitioning between species, whereas analyses from a smaller wetland complex with lower vegetative species richness and diversity showed significant dietary niche overlap. Determining the potential for competition between these two turtle species is important to understanding the ecological impacts of red-eared slider turtles in wetland habitats. In smaller wetlands with increased potential for competition between native turtles and invasive red-eared slider turtles we expect that when shared resources become limited, red-eared slider turtles will negatively impact native turtle species leading to long term population declines. Protection of intact wetland complexes and the reduction of introduced species populations are paramount to preserving populations of native species.},

We combined information about pre- and postdreissenid abundance, biomass, and secondary production of the littoral benthos with results of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of archival (predreissenid) and recent (postdreissenid) samples of all common benthic taxa. This approach enabled us to determine the importance of benthic and sestonic carbon to the littoral food web before, and more than a decade after dreissenid establishment. Long term dreissenid presence was associated with a 32-fold increase in abundance, 6-fold increase in biomass, and 14-fold increase in secondary production of the littoral benthos. Dreissenids comprised a large portion of the post-invasion benthos, making up 13, 38, and 56\% of total abundance, biomass, and secondary production, respectively. The predreissenid food web was supported primarily by benthic primary production, while sestonic material was relatively more important to the postdreissenid food web. The absolute importance of both sestonic material and benthic primary production to the littoral benthos increased considerably following dreissenid establishment. Our results show drastic alterations to food web structure and suggest that dreissenid mussels redirect energy and material from the water column to the littoral benthos both through biodeposition of sestonic material as well as stimulation of benthic primary production.},

	abstract = {Non-native species and habitat degradation are two major catalysts of environmental change and often occur simultaneously. In freshwater systems, degradation of adjacent terrestrial vegetation may facilitate introduced species by altering resource availability. Here we examine how the presence of intact riparian cover influences the impact of an invasive herbivorous snail, Tarebia granifera, on nitrogen (N) cycling in aquatic systems on the island of Trinidad. We quantified snail biomass, growth, and N excretion in locations where riparian vegetation was present or removed to determine how snail demographics and excretion were related to the condition of the riparian zone. In three Neotropical streams, we measured snail biomass and N excretion in open and closed canopy habitats to generate estimates of mass- and area-specific N excretion rates. Snail biomass was 2 to 8 times greater and areal N excretion rates ranged from 3 to 9 times greater in open canopy habitats. Snails foraging in open canopy habitat also had access to more abundant food resources and exhibited greater growth and mass-specific N excretion rates. Estimates of ecosystem N demand indicated that snail N excretion in fully closed, partially closed, and open canopy habitats supplied 2\%, 11\%, and 16\% of integrated ecosystem N demand, respectively. We conclude that human-mediated riparian canopy loss can generate hotspots of snail biomass, growth, and N excretion along tropical stream networks, altering the impacts of an invasive snail on the biogeochemical cycling of N.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions are a significant driver of human-induced global change and many ecosystems sustain sympatric invaders. Interactions occurring among these invaders have important implications for ecosystem structure and functioning, yet they are poorly understood. Here we apply newly developed metrics derived from stable isotope data to provide quantitative measures of trophic diversity within populations or species. We then use these to test the hypothesis that sympatric invaders belonging to the same functional feeding group occupy a smaller isotopic niche than their allopatric counterparts. Two introduced, globally important, benthic omnivores, Louisiana swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and carp (Cyprinus carpio), are sympatric in Lake Naivasha, Kenya. We applied our metrics to an 8-year data set encompassing the establishment of carp in the lake. We found a strong asymmetric interaction between the two invasive populations, as indicated by inverse correlations between carp abundance and measures of crayfish trophic diversity. Lack of isotopic niche overlap between carp and crayfish in the majority of years indicated a predominantly indirect interaction. We suggest that carp-induced habitat alteration reduced the diversity of crayfish prey, resulting in a reduction in the dietary niche of crayfish. Stable isotopes provide an integrated signal of diet over space and time, offering an appropriate scale for the study of population niches, but few isotope studies have retained the often insightful information revealed by variability among individuals in isotope values. Our population metrics incorporate such variation, are robust to the vagaries of sample size and are a useful additional tool to reveal subtle dietary interactions among species. Although we have demonstrated their applicability specifically using a detailed temporal dataset of species invasion in a lake, they have a wide array of potential ecological applications.},

	abstract = {The highly endemic native fish fauna has experienced dramatic reductions in abundance and range because of anthropogenic activity.  In addition to a highly altered flow, temperature, and physical habitat template, many non-native fish species have established populations throughout the basin.  The San Rafael River, a tributary of the Green River in southeastern Utah, is home to populations of flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis), bluehead sucker (C. discobolus), and roundtail chub (Gila robusta), and has experienced degradations representative of many rivers throughout the Colorado River Basin.  Using the San Rafael River as a template, I examined (1) the effect of the non-native fishes on the food web structure of a Colorado River tributary and (2) whether any changes to the food web structure by non-native fishes impact fitness-related vital rates of native fishes in the river.  Stable isotope analysis revealed that the non-native fishes present novel predator archetypes to the "three species," but size-at-age and body condition analyses did not reveal any reduction in fitness between native fishes captured in the presence of the non-native fishes.     Additionally, I used site-specific biotic and abiotic measurements to develop a model predicting "three species" relative abundance.  Non-native fish abundance and spatially auto-correlated measures of physical habitat were found to be particularly important predictors of "three species" relative abundance.  The model was used in combination with a longitudinal habitat survey to predict the current continuous distribution along the length of the lower San Rafael River, as well as to simulate population-level effects of relevant restoration actions.  The eradication of non-native fishes resulted in significant population increases for each of the 'three species,' and physical habitat restoration resulted in significant population increases when executed in certain reaches, but significant population reductions if executed in other reaches.  These results suggest that the restoration of physical habitat without addressing populations of non-native fishes will likely result in a limited response by the "three species," and that the choice of restoration location is critical to its success.},

	abstract = {The degree to which invasive species have altered the demography, ranges, and microhabitat occupation of native species is poorly known. Yet, the competitionmediated decline of native populations, in concert with other factors such as habitat degradation, can place native species at risk of extirpation. Understanding whether competition between native and non-native species can take place under ordinary environmental conditions can allow us to extrapolate whether native species are likely to have experienced harm in the past and/or if they are likely to do so in the future. The native slug Philomycus carolinianus is likely to compete for resources with the aggressive non-native slug Arion subfuscus in central Maryland forests. In order to establish whether competition occurs between these two species, I tested for the following criteria: the existence of competitive displacement in the field, overlap in the use of limited resources (shelter and food), a decline in the fitness of P. carolinianus in the presence of A. subfuscus, and the action of competition mechanisms (interference and exploitation) between them. Field surveys showed that displacement between A. subfuscus and P. carolinianus does not apparently occur within mixed natural populations. Resource use of the two slugs overlapped, with part of the diet (i.e. fungus) and a large proportion of the microhabitats occupied (i.e. coarse woody debris) in common. A lab experiment established that low natural levels of food (fungus) can limit the fitness of each slug species, while shelter (coarse woody debris) was not limiting. When sharing a low-resource lab cage with either A. subfuscus or conspecifics, P. carolinianus experienced a similar decline in fitness, suggesting that exploitative resource competition was no greater between heterospecifics than between conspecifics. No evidence of heterospecific interference (competition independent of resource levels) was found. Given the limited support for the criteria of competition,  A. subfuscus was not shown to be an immediate threat to the persistence of P. carolinianus.},

Methodology/Principal Findings
We used ENM to estimate the potential distributional area for each species in North America using models based on native range distribution data. Environmental data layers for native and introduced ranges were imported from state, national, and international climate and environmental databases. Models were evaluated using independent validation data on native and invaded areas. We calculated omission error for the independent validation data for each species: all native range tests were highly successful (all omission values {\textless}7\%); invaded-range predictions were predictive for common and grass carp (omission values 8.8 and 19.8\%, respectively). Model omission was high for introduced tench populations (54.7\%), but the model correctly identified some areas where the species has been successful; distributional predictions for black carp show that large portions of eastern North America are at risk.
Conclusions/Significance
ENMs predicted potential ranges of carp species accurately even in regions where the species have not been present until recently. ENM can forecast species' potential geographic ranges with reasonable precision and within the short screening time required by proposed U.S. invasive species legislation.},

While there may be countless vectors of transportation for these species, it remains a fact that transient recreational boating is the primary mechanism of overland dispersal. This regional study is the current representation (2008) of the specific pattern of spread among waterbodies that will be experienced in the Southwestern region of the United States, should the Zebra/Quagga mussel show up via recreational boating. This study has fully examined the greater details involved in the travel and tourism of recreational boaters in SW US from the exquisite vantage point of Lake Powell. It has been determined that regional expansion of the Zebra/Quagga mussel will likely continue in the area due careless recreational boating practices. Without the knowledge of the spatial patterns of dispersal, regional non-indigenous species prevention and management strategies will be lost and the Colorado River will thus disperse the mussel throughout the entire region. With the combined efforts of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area prevention partners and the different jurisdictions commitment to funding enforcement, Lake Powell has become a major influence of knowledge and authority for other agencies who have only just begun to develop a defense plan. By and large, the results of this study represent the pervasive threat of a complete invasion that lingers over Lake Powell, the Colorado River Drainage Basin, and the entire region.},

	abstract = {This research addresses the relationship between environmental conditions, ecological patterns, and physiological stress characteristics in two eastern Pacific mussel congeners, Mytilus galloprovincialis  and Mytilus trossulus. While M. trossulus  is native to the region, M. galloprovincialis is an invasive species introduced to the eastern Pacific nearly a century ago. The two species overlap in range and compete for resources in central California, but species abundances are largely segregated across habitats and latitude. It is thought that differential environmental tolerances may play a significant role in setting the distributions of these species.   Using a combination of field surveys and molecular laboratory analyses, this research correlated environmental conditions with physiological functioning to identify how evolved tolerances map on to ecological patterns. Results support the hypothesis that M. galloprovincialis and  M. trossulus differ in their environmental tolerances. The native species exhibited more cool-adapted and euryhaline traits, while the invader suggested a more stenohaline and warm-adapted physiology. These differences were observed in stress response profiles across seasons, habitats, and laboratory acclimations. In Bodega Bay, CA, field surveys also showed the two species to segregate across littoral zones, a pattern which had not previously been reported and has significant implications for future monitoring of these species.    An analysis of field condition across latitude was also undertaken using  M. galloprovincialis, intended to measure the extent and nature of acclimatization patterns across large spatial scales. The study found  M. galloprovincialis to vary in standing stocks of stress proteins across sites, correlated with relative water temperatures in each region. The relationship between constitutive stress proteins and the inducible "heat shock" response was also explored and results suggested that constitutive proteins may provide a protective role in high-stress environments.   These studies collectively help to characterize the physiological traits that may underlie many of the distribution patterns observed between M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. By considering questions of ecology and individual functioning within the context of one another, these types of macro-physiological studies may inform our understanding of the M. galloprovincialis invasion, and perhaps also address larger ecological questions such as species ranges, competition, and responses of organisms to climate change.},

	abstract = {Many ecological models quantify patterns that result from biological processes, extrapolate the patterns to make predictions into the future, and infer causality. These models describe the results of biological processes but are limited in understanding the interactions within the system. However, many ecological processes are complex systems comprised of many heterogeneous components that learn and adapt to a changing landscape that create patterns as emergent properties from individual decisions. This dissertation proposes a generic framework of how biological processes work. From this framework a modeler can capture biological processes by explicitly modeling time, space, and the essence of the decision making of the components of a biological process to understand causality.    Three models are presented exploring the continuum of capturing biological realism. The first explores the potential effects the doubling of CO 2 will have on four wildlife species. Through a logistic regression, the model quantifies current wildlife distribution patterns and projects these characteristics onto the changed landscape after the doubling of CO2 . Causality is inferred and little is understood of the biological interactions.    The second model places virtual moose onto a Geographic Information System (GIS) landscape and based on a series of physiological characteristics the moose select the optimum activity budget to maximize fitness within the landscape. The model simulates space and the decision making in a more biological realistic manner than the first model, but time is generalized.    The third model is agent-based in which virtual cougars are placed in a GIS landscape and make tradeoffs each time step as they move through the landscape. The tradeoffs include hunting, mating, and remaining safe. The model explicitly models time, space, and the essence of a cougar decision making thus modeling in a more biological realistic manner.    Due to the magnitude and speed at which change is now occurring, models based on observations that quantify and describe processes and patterns and attempt to replicate these processes may no longer suffice. In order to predict the success or survival of the ecological elements in these new situations, we must understand the mechanisms that drive the elements.},

This timely book on Extremophilic alga, including its especially impressive micrographs, may provide clues about the edges of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere in the universe. 
Defining locations from the anthropomorphic point of view, the environments explored ranges from severe and distant to "normal" places. The algae discussed, microbial oxygenic phototrophs, are classified into various categories according to their habitats. They thrive in various temperature ranges, at the limits of pH values, in salt solutions, under UV radiation, dryness, heavy metals, anaerobic niches, under various levels of illuminations, and under hydrostatic pressure. Authors discuss bio-diversely algal territories ecologically - the hot springs with the thermophiles or acido-thermophiles; Antarctica, the Artic, and permafrost zones with their cold lovers (Psychrophiles); soda lakes with the alkaliphiles, saltine areas with halophiles. In addition to general essays, Algal species discussed in detail include diatoms, Cyanidium, Galdieria, Dunaliella, and Chroococcidiopsis.
This volume is a must for students of the field of biodiversity, as well as those in Phycology, ecology and general biological research.Invaluable collection of essays on the life of extremophilic algae Unique reading about algae living at the edge of life Leading scientists' contributions cover all aspects of algae in servere habitats Modern science knowledge of phototrophic microbes Impressive photos and micrographs of various algae},

The subsequent installation of a permanent wind-break at a site with a wetland re-connection in 2001 resulted in increased wetland-like habitat, reduced diversity and numbers of macroinvertebrates and had inconclusive results for fishes. Analysis of nest and juvenile fish data for Lepomis spp., largemouth and smallmouth bass found relationships between habitat and densities of nests and juvenile fish. Maps were generated to identify locations of the highest densities of nests and juveniles for use in lake restoration efforts. The construction of more habitat modules is not recommended.},

	abstract = {Stream flow is a major vector for zebra mussel spread among inland lakes. I hypothesized that vegetated waterways, i.e. wetland streams, would hinder downstream dispersal of zebra mussels in connected inland lake systems. To test this hypothesis, veliger (larva) abundance, recruitment, and adult mussels were surveyed in four lake-wetland systems in southeastern Michigan, USA from May through August 2006. Sampling was conducted downstream of the zebra mussel invaded lakes, beginning at the upstream edge of aquatic vegetation and continuing downstream through the wetland streams. Results showed that veliger abundance decreased rapidly in vegetated waterways compared to their previously reported rates of decrease in non-vegetated streams. Veligers were rarely found more than 1 km downstream from where vegetation began. Newly recruited individuals and adults were extremely rare beyond open water in the study systems. These results suggest that densely vegetated aquatic ecosystems limit the dispersal of zebra mussels downstream from invaded sources. Natural, remediated and constructed wetlands may therefore serve as a protective barrier to help prevent the spread of zebra mussels and other aquatic invasive species to other lakes and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Herein, I describe research that quantifies how native and non-native (henceforth exotic) benthic organisms influence community and ecosystem processes. As aquatic ecosystems are recovering from years of excessive inputs of nutrients and industrial pollution, the influence of benthic food webs on the overall ecosystem likely will increase. By conducting a series of laboratory and outdoor experiments, observational studies, and field assessments in small reservoirs, I quantified how benthic organisms transfer material to higher trophic levels. For the native omnivore, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, growth and survival depended on the quality of sediment detritus, suggesting that detritus quality ultimately can regulate community and ecosystem productivity, mediated by its influence on gizzard shad biomass available for trophic transfer to piscivorous fish (Chapter 2). The addition of an exotic, benthic fish, round goby Neogobius melanostomus to the Lake Erie ecosystem, by being preferentially consumed over native prey by smallmouth bass  Micropterus dolomieu appears to transfer benthic energy and contaminants to the pelagic food web (Chapter 3). A field study and historical data in Lake Erie revealed biomagnification of PCBs by an exotic species component (comprising round goby and dreissenid mussels Dreissena spp.) to native terminal predators, smallmouth bass and largemouth bass  Micropterus salmoides (Chapter 4). Recovering benthic macroinvertebrate communities in Lake Erie appear influenced by dreissenid mussels and dreissenid mussel interactions with PCBs and organic content of sediments (Chapter 5). As nutrient and contaminant inputs continue to decline and exotic species continue to proliferate, I predict an increase in the relative importance of such benthic transfer pathways in influencing variability in transfer of energy and contaminants from to the pelagic food web.},

	abstract = {Distinct changes have occurred in the size and composition of the spring phytoplankton community in the eastern basin of Lake Erie following the introduction of Dreissena. Since 1996, total phytoplankton biovolume has decreased to approximately 20\% of pre-Dreissena levels, whereas postinvasion concentrations of spring soluble nutrients, particularly silica, have been substantially elevated compared with earlier years. Spring dominance has shifted from a mix of pennate and large centric diatoms and pyrrophytes to three centric diatoms with high silica requirements: Aulacoseira islandica, Stephanodiscus hantzschii, and Stephanodiscus parvus, and the overall diversity and species richness of the spring phytoplankton community has declined significantly. In addition, current April silica concentrations are approximately twice as high as historical (i.e., 1960s-1980s) winter maxima, indicating that the silica content of the lake has increased since the dreissenid invasion. These results suggest that the severe silica depletion caused by increased anthropogenic inputs of nutrients during the last century has been mitigated through a decrease in diatom production, most likely brought about by dreissenid grazing.

	abstract = {British scientists may have found the chemical magic bullet that kills zebra mussels without harming other organisms in the water. The problem is that another bivalve, the quagga mussel, is already taking over from the zebra as Invasive Nuisance Number One.                 A leading expert in invasive species, the University of Windsor's Hugh MacIsaac, says the quagga perform better than the zebra in cold water, so they have taken over the deep sections of Lakes Erie and Ontario. Like the zebra, the quagga originally comes from rivers flowing into the Black Sea. With luck, it will like the same junk food.                 This view prevails even though honey is the oldest wound dressing known to medicine, with recorded use back to the time of the Egyptians. In Britain and New Zealand, honey gels and gauzes impregnated with honey are approved for general use.},

	abstract = {Twenty sites along the St. Lawrence River were sampled to determine if the distribution and abundance of invasive mussels (zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis)) are explained by physicochemical variables. Calcium concentration, substrate size, and depth independently explained significant proportions of variation in biomass for both species. Zebra mussel populations occurred at calcium levels as low as 8 mg Ca.L{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}, but quagga mussels were absent below 12 mg Ca.L{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}, suggesting that they have higher calcium requirements. Both species increased in biomass with increasing substrate size but displayed contrasting patterns with depth. Using combinations of these environmental variables, we developed stepwise multiple regression models to predict zebra mussel biomass and quagga mussel biomass. The zebra mussel model included calcium concentration, substrate size, and depth (r{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} = 0.36, P {\textless} 0.0001), while the quagga mussel model included only substrate size and depth (r{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} = 0.32, P {\textless} 0.0001). These results suggest that dreissenid mussel abundance (and correlated impacts) will vary predictably across environmental gradients, but the same predictive model will not be accurate for both species.

	abstract = {Conservation biologists and other environmentalists confront five obstacles in building support for regulatory policies that seek to exclude or remove introduced plants and other non-native species that threaten to harm natural areas or the natural environment. First, the concept of "harm to the natural environment" is nebulous and undefined. Second, ecologists cannot predict how introduced species will behave in natural ecosystems. If biologists cannot define "harm" or predict the behavior of introduced species, they must target all non-native species as potentially "harmful." an impossibly large regulatory task. Third, loss of species richness may constitute harm to an environment, but introduced organisms typically, generally, and significantly add to species richness in ecosystems. If species richness correlates with desirable ecosystem properties, moreover, such as stability and productivity, as some ecologists believe, then introduced organisms, by increasing species richness, would support those desirable properties. Fourth, one may plausibly argue that extinction constitutes environmental harm, but there is no evidence that non-native species, especially plants, are significant causes of extinction, except for predators in certain lakes and other small island-like environments. Fifth, while aesthetic, ethical, and spiritual values may provide a legitimate basis for invasive species policy, biologists often cite concepts such as "biodiversity" and ecosystem "health" or "integrity" to provide a scientific justification. To assert that non-native species threaten biodiversity or undermine ecosystem health, however, may be to draw conceptual entailments or consequences from definitions of "biodiversity" and "integrity" that arbitrarily exclude non-native species or make the presence of exotic species a per se indicator of decline.

	abstract = {Large numbers of the filter-feeding larval stage of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) (veligers) have been advected into the estuarine transition zone (ETZ) of the St. Lawrence River. In 1994, they became the dominant member of the tidal freshwater zooplankton assemblage of the ETZ (and subsequently the true estuarine assemblage) during summer months. These changes in community structure have not, however, been reflected in changes in the abundance of preinvasion taxa. Abundance of potential planktonic competitors such as rotifers and the cladoceran Bosmina longirostris fluctuated between years but did not decline following the invasion. Only densities of the copepod Eurytemora affinis declined in 2000 and 2001, but this could not be definitively associated with the invasion. Synchronous variation among different zooplankton groups suggests that environmental forcing related to or correlated with temperature anomalies is the major cause of interannual variation in the abundance of zooplankton taxa. The negative correlation between veliger abundance and salinity indicates that the ETZ acts as a sink for the larval stages of the zebra mussel. Their precise fate remains uncertain, but our study suggests that this invasion has had little or no impact on this pelagic community in spite of the numerical dominance of veligers.

	abstract = {The potential transfer of heavy metals via trophic transfer (bioaccumulation) in global aquatic ecosystems is of growing concern amongst members of today's society. Therefore it is important to examine contaminated ecosystems beginning with the organisms that have the highest potential for exposure. Bivalve species have traditionally been considered excellent biomonitors of metal levels in marine environments. My research examines the combined influences of abiotic (salinity, ecosystem quality) and biotic factors (food quality and selection) on heavy metal uptake and availability in the West coast blue mussel Mytilus trossulus.    Flow-through (48) and pulse-feeding (66) experiments were conducted using either single or combinations of marine bacteria, phytoplankton, natural sediments and clay food sources. Flow-through experiments involved feeding  M. trossulus a marine bacterium containing non-radioactive Mn, Cd, or Pb oxides and varying amounts of carbon. Bacteria containing higher amounts of carbon had enhanced metal uptake due to an increased clearance rate of the organic rich particles. Pulse-feeding experiments involved feeding  M. trossulus combinations of radiolabelled 109Cd phytoplankton, clay and natural sediments containing varying amounts of carbon. To obtain natural, biologically-relevant sediments unique intertidal sediment traps were designed and deployed at two estuarine habitats. The sediment quality and salinity of these habitats (Boundary Bay and Deep Bay) differed significantly (24\% C and 25 ppt vs. 15\% C and 15 ppt., respectively). Results indicated that lower salinity environments may result in significantly lower dietary cadmium uptake and assimilation efficiencies in M. trossulus when compared to higher salinity environments.    My research demonstrated that the active selection of food particles by M. trossulus significantly affected the extent of metal uptake and assimilation. In addition, the bioaccumulation of metals by  M. trossulus inhabiting different marine habitats varied depending on the natural abiotic conditions within that habitat, such as salinity. I conclude that using M. trossulus as a biomonitor of marine metal levels is useful so long as the feeding behaviour and abiotic habitat parameters are considered when comparing metal levels in M. trossulus  between different habitats.},

	abstract = {We used an individual-based bioenergetic model to simulate the phosphorus flux of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) population in central Lake Erie during 1995-2002. Estimates of round goby diet composition, growth rates, and population abundance were derived from field sampling. As an abundant introduced fish, we predicted that round gobies would influence phosphorus cycling both directly, through excretion, and indirectly, through consumption of dreissenid mussels, whose high mass-specific phosphorus excretion enhances recycling. In 1999, when age-1+ round gobies reached peak abundance near 350 million (2.4 kg.ha{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}), annual phosphorus excretion was estimated at 7 t (1.4 × 10{\textasciicircum}sup -3{\textasciicircum} mg P.m{\textasciicircum}sup -2{\textasciicircum}.day{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}). From an ecosystem perspective, however, round gobies excreted only 0.4\% of the phosphorus needed by the benthic community for primary production. Indirectly, round gobies consumed {\textless}0.2\% of dreissenid population biomass, indicating that round gobies did not reduce nutrient availability by consuming dreissenids. Compared with previous studies that have revealed introduced species to influence phosphorus cycling, round gobies likely did not attain a sufficiently high biomass density to influence phosphorus cycling in Lake Erie.

	abstract = {Despite predictions that the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion of North America would damage fisheries, analyses of actual effects on fish have been few and equivocal. We analyze 26 years of data on fish populations in the Hudson River to quantify changes associated with the zebra mussel invasion. Based on our measurements of changes in the lower food web, we predicted that populations of open-water fish species (e.g., Alosa spp.) would suffer and populations of littoral fish species (e.g., Centrarchidae) would prosper from the zebra mussel invasion. We found that the median decrease in abundance of open-water species was 28\%, whereas the median increase in abundance of littoral species was 97\%. Populations of open-water species shifted downriver away from the zebra mussel population, whereas those of littoral species shifted upriver. Median apparent growth rates fell by 17\% among open-water species and rose by 12\% in the single littoral species studied. Many of the observed changes were large and involved species of commercial or recreational importance (e.g., American shad (Alosa sapidissima), black basses (Micropterus spp.)). The influence of zebra mussels on fish should vary widely across ecosystems as a function of system morphology, factors that limit primary production, and diets of the fish species.

	abstract = {Food web interactions between native larval bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), exotic invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), and Zooplankton were examined with a mesocosm experiment. Hatchling larval bluegill collected from nests were reared in the presence of size-structured populations of zebra mussels in 1500-L limnocorrals suspended in an artificial pond for 2 weeks. Chlorophyll a, other limnological variables, and Zooplankton abundance and biomass (including copepod nauplii and rotifers) were monitored over time. During their first 2 weeks of life, larval fish reared in the presence of mussels grew 24\% more slowly than fish reared alone. Differential growth rates can be explained by competition between mussels and bluegill for food in the form of microzooplankton. Also likely was an indirect competition via starvation of the Zooplankton community as zebra mussels consumed phytoplankton. Either direct or indirect trophic competition between zebra mussels and obligate planktivores may result in ecological harm as zebra mussels spread throughout inland lakes of North America.

Since 1994, Dreissena polymorpha veligers have become the dominant Zooplankton (up to 260 individuals-L{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}). The environmental factors controlling their distribution across the ETZ and their potential impact on the plankton were determined. Their horizontal distribution was limited by salinity, with maximum decreases in concentration at 2[per thousand]. A sharp decline in prey availability at {\textgreater}2[per thousand] may be a secondary Stressor for the veligers, in addition to the direct effects of salinity. Their vertical distribution was homogeneous throughout the water column, even in the presence of a pycnocline. Redundancy analysis showed that veliger concentrations were positively correlated with temperature and turbidity and negatively correlated with salinity and total phosphorus. Veligers were also positively correlated with chlorophyll a and picophytoplankton concentrations, suggesting little effect on their phytoplankton prey. Moreover, the veligers were positively correlated with the sestonic ratio of paniculate to total phosphorus, indicating their positive association with good food quality. The veligers appear to have no severe negative impacts on the ETZ plankton community and are restricted to favourable conditions for their survival in the upstream, low salinity region of the ETZ.

Between May and August, I measured respiration (1998), shell growth of marked mussels suspended in cages in the lake (1999-2000), soft body mass and mass of gametes released (1998-2001), and the number of gametes released by individual mussels (1999). Quagga mussels had lower respiration rates and greater shell growth and body mass. There was no difference in the percentage of spawning mussels or the number of sperm released by individuals, but zebra mussels generally released more eggs and a greater mass of gametes than did quagga mussels. Similar reproduction at a lower body mass indicates that zebra mussels devote a greater proportion of body tissue to reproduction. Lower respiration rates and larger size give quagga mussels a competitive advantage and may explain their displacement of zebra mussels.},

The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, and quagga mussel, Dreissena bugensis, continue to colonize hard and soft substrates of the Great Lakes and are changing ecosystem function through mechanisms of ecosystem engineering (increased water clarity and reef building), fouling native mussels, high particle filtration rate with selective rejection of colonial cyanobacteria in pseudofeces, alteration of nutrient ratios, and facilitation of the rapid spread of their Ponto-Caspian associates, the benthic amphipod Echinogammarus ischnus and the round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, which feeds on zebra mussels. The tubenose goby, Proterorhinus marmoratus, which does not feed on zebra mussels, has not spread rapidly. Impacts of these benthic invaders vary with site: in some shallow areas, habitat changes and the Dreissena to round goby to piscivore food chain have improved conditions for certain native game fishes and waterfowl; in offshore waters, Dreissena is competing for settling algae with the native amphipod Diporeia spp., which are disappearing to the detriment of the native deep-water fish community. The predatory cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi may compete with small fishes for zooplankton and increase food-chain length.},

This hypothesis was evaluated for invasive aquatic species in North America, particularly Asian clams, Corbicula fluminea, and zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha. Both species have rapid growth, early maturity, short life spans, and elevated fecundity, allowing rapid population recovery after reductions by rarefractive, environmental extremes. Extensive resistance capacities offer little adaptive value to invasive, r-selected species, because population reductions occur in their unstable habitats regardless of degree of stress tolerance. Thus, both species have relatively poor physiologic resistance, depending instead on elevated growth and fecundity for rapid population recovery. In contrast, native North American bivalve species are often adapted to stable habitats where perturbation is infrequent (i.e., freshwater unionoidean bivalves). They are characterized by slow growth, extended life spans, and low effective fecundities, slowing population recoveries (K-selected), and have evolved extensive resistance adaptations to avoid extirpation during environmental extremes. Review of resistance adaptations in other North American aquatic invaders revealed poorer or equivalent physiological tolerance relative to taxonomically related native species, suggesting that extensive physiological tolerance is not required for invasive success.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in Lake Champlain have colonized the shells of many native unionids, causing declines in their abundance. Periodically cleaning zebra mussels from unionids may be an effective conservation technique, if unionids can recover from the stress induced by zebra mussels. Efforts will need to target species that are most vulnerable to fouling and subsequent energetic losses. We used glycogen as a biochemical indicator of energetic stores to assess species-specific differences in tolerance to zebra mussels. There was no evidence that glycogen levels decreased as dreissenid/unionid mass ratios increased in Elliptio complanata. However, dreissenid/ unionid mass ratios as low as 0.25 in Lampsilis radiata were correlated with a significant decline in glycogen content. The ability of these species to recover glycogen after zebra mussel removal and replacement in situ was also evaluated. Mussels were cleaned of zebra mussels and replaced in situ. After 10 weeks, cleaned, heavily fouled, and never-fouled (control) mussels were collected. Glycogen levels in fouled mussels were lower than in the control mussels, while glycogen levels in cleaned mussels did not differ from the control mussels. Results suggest that heavily fouled               The relationship between the magnitude of zebra mussel fouling and glycogen content was determined for E. complanata and L. radiata in Lake Champlain, Vt. These two species are the most abundant unionids in Lake Champlain (Fiske and Levy 1996). The magnitude of fouling was expressed using the dreissenid/unionid mass ratio (Ricciardi et al. 1996), which was determined by dividing the blotted wet mass of the removed zebra mussels by the blotted wet mass of the unionid. Dreissenid/unionid mass ratios were obtained using 56 E. complanata and 92 L. radiata during the 1st week of July from Button Bay. An additional 29 E. complanata and 18 L. radiata were collected for glycogen analysis from Button Bay during the first 2 weeks of August 1997, using SCUBA (Fig. 1). Collections were made 100 m west of the boating access ramp in 0.5-1.5 m of water. Efforts were made to collect unionids that exhibited a range of zebra mussel fouling. Unionids were sacrificed after zebra mussel removal and a sample of mantle tissue, lining the mantle cavity, was removed. We examined the relationship between observed dreissenid/unionid mass ratios and glycogen content with a Spearman's rank correlation (Zar 1984). After plotting glycogen data, a post hoc analysis was used to determine the fouling threshold at which glycogen content began to significantly decline. A Welch's t test was used to examine differences between selected groups.               To determine the ability of L. radiata and E. complanata to recover glycogen after zebra mussel removal, a cleaning experiment was performed at the Lewis Creek delta on July 15, 1997, in an area where heavily fouled mussels were observed (Fig. 1). The experimental area was located 100 m west of the mouth. SCUBA was used to collect 35 heavily fouled E. complanata and 35 L. radiata individuals from the sand-silt substrate in 1-2 m of water. All zebra mussels were removed and each unionid shell was thoroughly scrubbed with a small brush. The dreissenid/unionid mass ratio was obtained for each cleaned unionid. Mussels were individually marked by scribing through the periostracum with a dental pick. The mussels were replaced in a 4-m2 open-topped chicken wire pen that was secured to the substrate with eight rebar stakes. The diameter of the chicken wire (25 mm) and open top allowed normal water flow through the area. The pen was inspected every 2 weeks for dead mussels. All mussels were removed from the pen on September 30, 1997, and an equivalent number of zebra mussel fouled unionids of each species was collected in close proximity to the pen. During the same week, 20 E. complanata and 20 L. radiata were collected from the Lamoille River delta, approximately 30 miles (48 km) north of Lewis Creek. Zebra mussels were not present at the Lamoille River delta, so this sample represented unionids living in a delta environment that had never been fouled by zebra mussels.},

	abstract = {Larvae of the invading mussels travelled from their native European waters to the Great Lakes in the bilge holds of cargo ships in the 1980s. Since then, like many other types of exotic or imported plants and animals, the mussel has taken to its new surroundings with a reproductive vengeance. Colonies with as many as 700,000 of the tiny fan-shaped creatures per square metre have been reported in the western basin of Lake Erie. The long-term cost of keeping the mussel away from beaches, boats, and water pipes has been estimated at billions of dollars.                 Today, Prof. [Richard Knapton] believes the ducks have some effect on controlling zebra mussel populations at Long Point, a critical stopover point for migrating birds. A more important factor in controlling mussel numbers, he believes, is a shortage of the micro- organisms the mussels eat. The mussels' food supply is diminished, especially in the summer, he says, when the currents that bring the micro-organisms to the mussels are not as strong.                 Researchers are still evaluating the impact all these birds might have on long-term zebra mussel populations in the Great Lakes, says David Ankney, a professor of zoology at the University of Western Ontario. A study of zebra mussel beds at Point Pelee by one of Prof. Ankney's graduate students, Diana Hamilton, found that waterfowl could eat as much as 40\%-50\% of the mussels in a given area.},

Little is known about the quagga mussels, but like the zebra mussel, they act like mini-water treatment plants, filtering out impurities and contaminants. Both varieties were introduced to the Great Lakes by ocean-going freighters dumping fresh water ballast originally taken on at their home ports in Europe.                 "Lakes that are not vulnerable to invasion to zebra mussels could be vulnerable to invasion by quagga mussels because of the ability to reproduce at lower temperatures," MacIsaac said.},

The mussels haven't been spotted in any new locations this year and seem to be missing from most of the lakes in Muskoka and neighboring Haliburton area, where their discovery last year had cottagers and boaters fearing the worst.                 Researchers suspect the cool summer has slowed the spread of zebra mussels in the Great Lakes, which means it takes the creatures longer to find their way into inland waterways, where temperatures in shallow lakes are generally above the 12C (54F) the mussels need to reproduce.},

	abstract = {While the mute swan, the swan species most likely to be encountered along Toronto's waterfront, appears to be here to stay, if a co-ordinated effort were made in the relatively small number of provinces and states where the species has become established, it could be slowly and humanely eliminated, without a single bird being killed, by sterilizing the eggs.                 The other species I see as a potential threat to the environment is the red deer. Like the mute swan (plus the starling, pigeon, house sparrow, house mouse, purple loosestrife and zebra mussel) the red deer is native to Europe. It's kept on game farms in the province to provide venison to restaurants. It's a species with a track record of being able to establish itself in other regions, where its abundance has caused it to become a hated nuisance.                 We didn't know any better 101 years ago, but we should know better now, and yet we constantly run risks. I don't want to see our native wildlife replaced by non-native species. I don't want to see people hating red deer and mute swans. I don't want to see animal protectionists and conservationists fighting each other over relatively small differences in value systems, as has happened over the issue of culling deer threatening rare vegetation in isolated refugia in southwestern Ontario.},
