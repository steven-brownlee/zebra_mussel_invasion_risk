Among the conventional hydrogel materials, self-healing hydrogels (SHH) are showing their promise in biomedical applications in tissue engineering, wound healing, and drug delivery. Additionally, their responses can be controlled via external stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, pressure, or radiation). Identifying a suitable combination of viscous and elastic materials, lipophilicity and biocompatibility are crucial challenges in the development of SHH. Furthermore, the trade-off relation between the healing performance and the mechanical toughness also limits their real-time applications. Additionally, short-term and long-term effects of many SHH in the in vivo model are yet to be reported. This review will discuss the mechanism of various SHH, their recent advancements, and their challenges in tissue engineering, wound healing, and drug delivery.},

Particularly pertinent are questions about the state of the reparation system in the aquatic organisms, which make it possible to assess the resistance, survival of hydrobionts, and the probability of remote consequences under the impact of heavy metals. Therefore, in this work, we investigated genome integrity and DNA repair ability in the gill cells of Mytilus trossulus, under conditions of copper (Cu2+) accumulation, and in the process of tissue depuration from this metal. Although the biochemical detoxification system was functioning, it is noted that destructive processes developed, including the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products (MDA) and DNA damage. It was also found that in all of the experimental groups of Mytilus trossulus, in the process of depuration from Cu2+ for 24 h, the levels of DNA damage and MDA content were markedly reduced, and further reduction was less intense.},

	abstract = {Capsaicin has been extensively studied for its excellent antifouling activity and very low environmental toxicity. However, mixing natural capsaicin with coatings can cause rapid capsaicin leakage, severely shortening its antifouling cycle. In this study, we describe the preparation and performance of a new capsaicin-modified marine antifouling organofluorosilicone, which is based on silicone and fluorine acrylate monomers covalently bound to an organic antimicrobial monomer, HMBA (N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-acrylamide) on a polymer network. The chemical grafting of HMBA into the polymer has improved the problem of short antifouling life of the coating due to antifouling agent leakage and the environmental pollution caused by the leakage. The study focused on the synthesis of pristine acrylate monomers with organic bioactive groups prepared from vanillin amine salts and their co-polymerization in the presence of distal acrylate oligomers. The resulting cross-linked films were characterized using infrared spectroscopy, contact angle, and adhesion analyses. The results indicate that the materials had good adhesion, low surface energy, and were resistant to prolonged immersion in water. The polyacrylate coating synthesized from acrylate exhibited antibacterial and anti-algae activity. Biological tests on the marine microorganisms, Pseudomonas species, Shewanella species, and Navicula incerta, revealed a 97\%, 98\%, and 99\% reduction compared to the blank control group, respectively, indicating that the coating has strong anti-adhesive ability. This work is expected to develop a promising material for marine antifouling.},

	abstract = {The role of epistasis in driving adaptation has remained an unresolved problem dating back to the Evolutionary Synthesis. In particular, whether epistatic interactions among genes could promote parallel evolution remains unexplored. To address this problem, we employ an Evolve and Resequence (E\&R) experiment, using the copepod Eurytemora affinis, to elucidate the evolutionary genomic response to rapid salinity decline. Rapid declines in coastal salinity at high latitudes are a predicted consequence of global climate change. Based on time-resolved pooled whole-genome sequencing, we uncover a remarkably parallel, polygenic response across ten replicate selection lines, with 79.4\% of selected alleles shared between lines by the tenth generation of natural selection. Using extensive computer simulations of our experiment conditions, we find that this polygenic parallelism is consistent with positive synergistic epistasis among alleles, far more so than other mechanisms tested. Our study provides experimental and theoretical support for a novel mechanism promoting repeatable polygenic adaptation, a phenomenon that may be common for selection on complex physiological traits.Using time-series whole-genome sequencing data from a laboratory evolution experiment, along with extensive computer simulations, the authors show that synergistic epistasis could drive rapid parallel freshwater adaptation in a saline copepod.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryContext of climate change is being widely studied, nevertheless its effects in the toxicity of other contaminants have been poorly study. Particularly, the effects of ocean acidification on the modulation of pharmaceutical absorption and consequent effects, have not been extensively addressed before. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of ocean acidification (specifically pH values of 8.2, 7.9, and 7.6) combined with paracetamol exposure (0, 30, 60, and 120 µg/L) on the polychaeta Hediste diversicolor. To do so, specific biomarkers were measured namely (CAT), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and cyclooxygenase (COX) activities, as well as thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), were quantified to serve as ecotoxicological endpoints. Alterations of CAT, and GSTs activities, and TBARS levels indicate an alteration in redox balances. Differences in exposed pH levels indicate the possible modulation of the absorption of this pharmaceutical in ocean acidifications scenarios. Alterations in AChE were only observed following paracetamol exposure, not being altered by media pH. Hereby obtained results suggest that seawater acidification is detrimental to marine wildlife, since it may enhance toxic effects caused by environmental realistic concentrations of pharmaceuticals. This work is crucial to understand the potential effects of pharmaceuticals in a climate change scenario.AbstractIncreasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are likely to lower ocean pH values, after its dissolution in seawater. Additionally, pharmaceuticals drugs are environmental stressors due to their intrinsic properties and worldwide occurrence. It is thus of the utmost importance to assess the combined effects of pH decreases and pharmaceutical contamination, considering that their absorption (and effects) are likely to be strongly affected by changes in oceanic pH. To attain this goal, individuals of the marine polychaete Hediste diversicolor were exposed to distinct pH levels (8.2, 7.9, and 7.6) and environmentally relevant concentrations of the acidic drug paracetamol (PAR: 0, 30, 60, and 120 µg/L). Biomarkers such as catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and cyclooxygenase (COX) activities, as well as peroxidative damage (through thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) quantification), were quantified to serve as ecotoxicological endpoints. Data showed a general increase in CAT and a decrease in GST activities (with significant fluctuations according to the tested conditions of PAR and pH). These changes are likely to be associated with alterations of the redox cycle driven by PAR exposure. In addition, pH levels seemed to condition the toxicity caused by PAR, suggesting that the toxic effects of this drug were in some cases enhanced by more acidic conditions. An inhibition of AChE was observed in animals exposed to the highest concentration of PAR, regardless of the pH value. Moreover, no lipid peroxidation was observed in most individuals, although a significant increase in TBARS levels was observed for polychaetes exposed to the lowest pH. Finally, no alterations of COX activities were recorded on polychaetes exposed to PAR, regardless of the pH level. The obtained results suggest that seawater acidification is detrimental to marine wildlife, since it may enhance toxic effects caused by environmental realistic concentrations of acidic drugs, such as PAR. This work was crucial to evidence that ocean acidification, in the context of a global change scenario of increased levels of both atmospheric and oceanic CO2, is a key factor in understanding the putative enhanced toxicity of most pharmaceutical drugs that are of an acidic nature.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is a major foodborne pathogen capable of infecting all warm-blooded animals, including humans. Although oocyst-associated toxoplasmosis outbreaks have been documented, the relevance of the environmental transmission route remains poorly investigated. Thus, we carried out an extensive systematic review on T. gondii oocyst contamination of soil, water, fresh produce, and mollusk bivalves, following the PRISMA guidelines. Studies published up to the end of 2020 were searched for in public databases and screened. The reference sections of the selected articles were examined to identify additional studies. A total of 102 out of 3201 articles were selected: 34 articles focused on soil, 40 focused on water, 23 focused on fresh produce (vegetables/fruits), and 21 focused on bivalve mollusks. Toxoplasma gondii oocysts were found in all matrices worldwide, with detection rates ranging from 0.09\% (1/1109) to 100\% (8/8) using bioassay or PCR-based detection methods. There was a high heterogeneity (I2 = 98.9\%), which was influenced by both the sampling strategy (e.g., sampling site and sample type, sample composition, sample origin, season, number of samples, cat presence) and methodology (recovery and detection methods). Harmonized approaches are needed for the detection of T. gondii in different environmental matrices in order to obtain robust and comparable results.},

Subsequently, the conditions created by metabolites and the activity of organisms trigger corrosion of the metal and accelerate corrosion locally, causing a deterioration in, and alterations to, the performance of devices made of stainless steel. The microorganisms which thus affect stainless steel are mainly algae and bacteria. Within the macroorganisms that then damage the steel, mollusks and crustaceans are the most commonly observed. The aim of this review was to identify the mechanisms involved in biofouling on stainless steel and to evaluate the research done on preventing or mitigating this problem using nanotechnology in humid environments in three areas of human activity: food manufacturing, the implantation of medical devices, and infrastructure in marine settings. Of these protective processes that modify the steel surfaces, three approaches were examined: the use of inorganic nanoparticles; the use of polymeric coatings; and, finally, the generation of nanotextures.},

This review summarizes the current knowledge on the pro-oxidant challenges from emerging environmental stressors threatening marine organisms, such as pharmaceuticals, microplastics and climate-related ocean changes. Emphasis will be placed on oxidative pathways, including signaling proteins and transcription factors involved in regulation of antioxidant responsiveness. Mechanistic insights and lack of knowledge will be pointed out by presenting single and combined effects of multiple stressors, unravelling questions to be addressed by future research in marine ecotoxicology.},

The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guides two social goods exhibiting an essential tension: effective law enforcement search and seizure, and protection of privacy. Unreliable information may subvert the U.S. judicial process. In Fourth Amendment cases involving the use of dogs to sniff out drugs, the validity of this Constitutional guidance is called into question by: the capabilities of the dog, the dog's training, the nature of human-canine interaction, the questionable objectivity of law enforcement officials who base the legitimacy of their searches upon dogs' alerts, and the knowledge of judges and lawyers of the capabilities of human-canine search teams. Each of these elements is characterized by and generates many kinds of information. Concerns about such information, however, are major. Objectives. We explore these concerns through a detailed examination of the 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision Florida v. Harris, draw some policy conclusions about the implications of this use of unreliable information in the judicial system, and provide a brief summary of the information-centric questions the paper considers.},

A substantial proportion of plastic produced worldwide is not properly disposed and persists in the environment for decades while degrading. Plastic degradation generates a size continuum of fragments, including nano- and microplastic particles, with numerous associated environmental pollutants and plastic additives, and microbial communities colonising their surfaces. The ubiquitous presence of NMPs, their availability for uptake by organisms and their potential to act as vectors for toxicants and pathogens render risk assessment a priority on the political agenda at the global level. We provide a new, fully integrated risk assessment framework tailored to the specificities of NMPs, enabling an assessment of current and future human health risks from NMPs. The framework consists of four novel paradigms to the traditional risk assessment methodology. These paradigms deal with techniques in NMP analysis, gaps in empirical data, theoretical and modelling approaches and stakeholder engagement. Within the proposed framework, we propose how we can use research experiences gained so far to carry out the different steps of the assessment process, and we define priorities for further research.},

Australia's ancient history and traditions are intimately intertwined with the rainforest plants that humans have utilised as both food and medicine. 

Phytochemistry of Australia's Tropical Rainforest is a record of this history and details how our understanding of these plants has led to the discovery of anaesthetics, analgesics, steroids, antimalarials and more. It provides an insight into the habitat, ecology and family associations of hundreds of species and explores their future therapeutic potential, alongside phytochemical studies of the ancient plant lineages. Toxicological evaluations of important poisonous plants are also included.
Rainforests provide shelter for unique flora and fauna that are counted among the rarest species on Earth, many of which are illustrated in this book. This comprehensive work is an essential reference for phytochemists, ethnobotanists and those with an interest in rainforests and their medicinal and botanical potential.},

	abstract = {Traditional Species Distribution Models (SDMs) may not be appropriate when examples of one class (e.g. absence or pseudo-absences) greatly outnumber examples of the other class (e.g. presences or observations), because they tend to favor the learning of observations more frequently. We present an ensemble method called Random UnderSampling and Boosting (RUSBoost), which was designed to address the case where the number of presence and absence records are imbalanced, and we opened the "black-box" of the algorithm to interpret its results and applicability in ecology. We applied our methodology to a case study of twenty-five species of bats from theIberian Peninsula and we build a RUSBoost model for each species. Furthermore,in order to improve to build tighter models, we optimized their hyperparametersusing Bayesian Optimization. In particular, we implemented a objective function that represents the cross-validation loss: kFoldLoss(z), with z representing the hyper-parameters Maximum Number of Splits, Number of Learners and Learning Rate. The models reached average values for Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, and overall accuracy of 0.84±0.05\%, 79.5±4.87\%, 74.9±6.05\%,and 78.8±5.0\%, respectively. We also obtained values of variable importance and we analyzed the relationships between explanatory variables and bat presence probability. The results of our study showed that RUSBoost could be a useful tool to develop SDMs with good performance when the presence/absence databases are imbalanced. The application of this algorithm could improve the prediction of SDMs and help in conservation biology and management.

And those who marvel at the loon's diving prowess might wonder why this bird has such skill, or where loons go when they must leave northern lakes in winter. For these and so many other mysteries, Loon Lessons provides evolutionary and ecological explanations that are curious and compelling. Written by one of the world's foremost experts on the subject, the book is a compendium of knowledge about the common loon and an engaging record of scientific sleuthing, documenting more than twenty-five years of research into the great northern diver. James D. Paruk has observed and compared loons from Washington and Saskatchewan to the coasts of California and Louisiana, from high elevation deserts in Nevada to mountain lakes in Maine. Drawing on his extensive experience, a wealth of data, and well-established scientific principles, he considers every aspect of the loon, from its plumage and anatomy to its breeding, migration, and wintering strategies. Here, in the first detailed scientific account of the common loon in more than thirty years, Paruk describes its biology in an accessible and entertaining style that affords a deeper understanding of this beautiful and mysterious bird's natural history and annual life cycle.},

In both experimental animals and humans, reduced body temperature has been related to extended longevity. However, recent findings on the function of thermogenic (brown or beige) adipose tissue produced intense interest in increasing the amount of energy expended for thermogenesis to prevent and/or treat obesity, improve metabolic health, and extend life. Evidence available to-date indicates that increasing adipose tissue thermogenesis by pharmacologic, environmental, or genetic interventions can indeed produce significant metabolic benefits, which are associated with improved chances for healthy aging and long life.},

Thirty-two different strains, representing six genera (10 strains of Bacillus, 9 of Vibrio, 6 Acinetobacter, 4 Staphylococcus, 2 Photobacterium, and 1 Exiguobacterium) were isolated. Those strains represented only 1.09\% of the relative abundance compared with the total microbiota obtained by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The metagenomic analysis identified 441 species.

We construct a vessel-versus-barge compliance cost framework informed by California efforts to provide additional protection from ballast discharge invasive risk. The technology-policy goal is to achieve the regulatory standards with appropriate technology, and meanwhile, minimize the compliance cost to reduce the burden on the shipping industry. The results show that the required numeric standards matter a lot. If a single global standard is a weak standard, then adopting vessel-based compliant technology is less costly than centralized barge-based compliance. We consider these findings to apply generally beyond the California context. Specifically, if some region or all regions adopt standards different from current global standards (i.e., stricter), barge-based systems can be less costly than retrofitting world fleets. The findings reveal the potential role of barge-based treatment measure. The increased \$0.7 billion compliance cost for the U.S. to achieve stricter ballast water regulation per year may inform the relevant policymakers.},

Conclusions

Microcystin RR and microcystin LR were detected for the first time in mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, harvested from farms in Thermaikos gulf, in Central Macedonia, in Greece. Their presence was linked to potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Bioaccumulation in digestive gland was observed, while the concentrations in muscles were found extremely low. Samples with levels above 1ng/g were observed mostly during spring, confirming the seasonal distribution of microcystins. The comparison of the results by the ELISA and the LC-Orbitrap MS method indicated an overestimation of concentration by the ELISA method.},

While macroalgae cultivation exists in Europe, it is not that widely distributed yet; with increasing marine activities at sea, Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) needs to ensure social recognition as well as social and spatial representation for such a new marine activity. This comparative case study analysis of MSPs of three eastern Baltic Sea countries explores the levels of support for the development of macroalgae cultivation in MSP and the degree of co-location options for this new and increasingly important sector. It presents new analytical ways of incorporating co-location considerations into the concept of social sustainability. The results of this study support the harmonisation of views on co-location, propose ways of using space to benefit multiple users as well as marine ecosystems, and highlight some of the key social challenges and enablers for this sector.},

We found that AIV remain infectious in water only for 36 h but persist in crabs for 48 h. Crabs could accumulate AIV in their gills and gastrointestinal tracts. The AIV titers in crabs were higher than the surrounding contaminated water. Crabs could accumulate AIV from contaminated water, carry the virus and spread to naïve crabs via surrounding water.

First, infectious cancers that can be transmitted as allografts between individual hosts, have been identified in four distinct, unrelated groups, dogs, Tasmanian devils, Syrian hamsters and, surprisingly, marine bivalves. These malignancies might hold the key to improving our understanding of the interaction between tumour cell and immune system and, thus, allow us to devise novel treatment strategies that enhance anti-cancer immunosurveillance, as well as suggesting more effective organ and stem cell transplantation strategies. The existence of these malignancies also highlights the need for increased scrutiny when considering the existence of infectious cancers in humans.
Second, it has long been understood that no linear relationship exists between the number of cells within an organism and the cancer incidence rate. To resolve what is known as Peto's Paradox, additional anticancer strategies within different species have to be postulated. These naturally occurring idiosyncrasies to avoid carcinogenesis represent novel potential therapeutic strategies.},

	abstract = {Metal-ion batteries are capable of delivering high energy density with a longer lifespan. However, they are subject to several issues limiting their utilization. One critical impediment is the budding and extension of solid protuberances on the anodic surface, which hinders the cell functionalities. These protuberances expand continuously during the cyclic processes, extending through the separator sheath and leading to electrical shorting. The progression of a protrusion relies on a number of in situ and ex situ factors that can be evaluated theoretically through modeling or via laboratory experimentation. However, it is essential to identify the dynamics and mechanism of protrusion outgrowth. This review article explores recent advances in alleviating metal dendrites in battery systems, specifically alkali metals. In detail, we address the challenges associated with battery breakdown, including the underlying mechanism of dendrite generation and swelling. We discuss the feasible solutions to mitigate the dendrites, as well as their pros and cons, highlighting future research directions. It is of great importance to analyze dendrite suppression within a pragmatic framework with synergy in order to discover a unique solution to ensure the viability of present (Li) and future-generation batteries (Na and K) for commercial use.},

In this article, we studied the short-term effects of polystyrene micro-spheres on genome integrity using the gametes of the Scaphechinus mirabilis sand dollar with the comet assay method. This highly sensitive method allowed us to identify the level of genome damage in both gametes before and after short-term exposure to PS microparticles. It was shown that primary polystyrene microspheres at concentrations of 104, 105, and 106 particles/L had a genotoxic effect during short-term exposure to the sperm of the sand dollar S. mirabilis, which was expressed as a significant increase in sperm DNA damage. The highest percentage of DNA damage (more than 20\%) was detected in spermatozoa exposed for 1 h in water containing 105 microspheres of plastic per 1 L. Additionally, at all concentrations of microplastic studied in the experiment, the genetic damage index (GDI) values in spermatozoa exceeded the control level. However, regardless of the level of DNA damage, spermatozoa retained the ability to fertilise eggs with up to 97\% efficiency. We must acknowledge that the genotoxic property of microplastic against sperm to some extent predicts the development of long-term adverse effects of environmental significance.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryThe release of medicinal products for human use in the aquatic environment is now a serious problem, and can be fatal for the organisms that live there. Danio rerio is a freshwater fish that provides the possibility to study the effects of these pollutants on the health of aquatic organisms. The results of the various existing scientific studies are scarce and conflicting. Here, we review the scientific studies that have analyzed these effects, highlighting that the impacts of drugs are evident in the biochemical responses of these animals.AbstractTo date, drug pollution in aquatic systems is an urgent issue, and Danio rerio is a model organism to study the toxicological effects of environmental pollutants. The scientific literature has analyzed the effect of human drug pollution on the biochemical responses in the tissues of D. rerio adults. However, the information is still scarce and conflicting, making it difficult to understand its real impact. The scientific studies are not consistent with each other and, until now, no one has grouped their results to create a baseline of knowledge of the possible impacts. In this review, the analysis of literature data highlights that the effects of drugs on adult zebrafishes depend on various factors, such as the tissue analyzed, the drug concentration and the sex of the individuals. Furthermore, the most influenced biochemical responses concern enzymes (e.g., antioxidants and hydrolase enzymes) and total protein and hormonal levels. Pinpointing the situation to date would improve the understanding of the chronic effects of human drug pollution, helping both to reduce it in the aquatic systems and then to draw up regulations to control this type of pollution.},

	abstract = {Klebsiella oxytoca is a recently emerging pathogen that can cause necrotizing enterocolitis, hemorrhagic colitis, sepsis-associated purpura fulminans, and infective endocarditis in humans. The bacterium is ubiquitous in water and soil environments. Nevertheless, current literature on K. oxytoca in aquatic products is rare. In this study, we surveyed K. oxytoca contamination in 41 species of consumable aquatic animals sold in July, August, and September of 2018 and 2019 in Shanghai, China, 40 of which had no history of carrying this bacterium. K. oxytoca was for the first time isolated from 14 species with high abundance in benthic animals. None of the K. oxytoca isolates (n = 125) harbored toxin genes mviM, tisB, and yqgB. However, a high occurrence of virulence-associated genes was observed, including brkB (73.6\%), cdcB (66.4\%), pduV (64.8\%), and virk (63.2\%). Resistance to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (56.0\%) was the most predominant among the isolates, followed by chloramphenicol (6.4\%), tetracycline (5.6\%), and kanamycin (3.2\%). Approximately 8.0\% of the isolates displayed multidrug resistant phenotypes. Meanwhile, high percentages of the isolates tolerated the heavy metals Cu2+ (84.8\%), Pb2+ (80.8\%), Cr3+ (66.4\%), Zn2+ (66.4\%), and Hg2+ (49.6\%). Different virulence and resistance profiles were observed among K. oxytoca isolates in 3 types and 14 species of aquatic animals. The ERIC-PCR-based genome fingerprinting of the 125 K. oxytoca isolates revealed 108 ERIC genotypes with 79 singletons, which demonstrated the genetic diversity of the isolates. The results of this study fill gaps for policy and research in the risk assessment of K. oxytoca in consumable aquatic animals.},

	abstract = {As solitary filter feeder, Styela clava shows superior water purification capacity in the integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) model consisting of S. clava, microalgae, and sea cucumber, which should be an ideal system to reduce organic and inorganic pollution in the water. It is of great significance to study the physiological energetics of S. clava for the application of this IMTA system. The physiological energetics of S. clava was determined in a simulated natural culture system to provide information for comparing to the energetic data derived from feeding ecological studies. The ascidians were grouped into five cohorts based on body size in terms of their wet weight of 1.5-2.0 g, 2.5-3.5 g, 5.0-6.5 g, 8.0-9.5 g, and 11.0-14.0 g, respectively. Clearance rate (CR), ingestion rate (IR), and assimilation efficiency (AE) of ascidian were estimated using flow-through feeding chambers. The results showed that the CR and IR increased exponentially with the ascidians' body size at different temperatures. Body size showed little effect on AE at the same water temperature. However, significant differences were observed between different temperature regions in the range of 12-28°C regardless of body size. S. clava performed far better in feeding behavior at 20°C than that at higher or lower temperatures. Within the range of diet concentration (as particulate organic matter, POM) from 2.11 to 6.11 mg POM/L, the CR and IR increased exponentially with POM. This study provides basic data for the application of ascidian in the IMTA system.},

	abstract = {Avian influenza is one of the largest known threats to domestic poultry. Influenza outbreaks on poultry farms typically lead to the complete slaughter of the entire domestic bird population, causing severe economic losses worldwide. Moreover, there are highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strains that are able to infect the swine or human population in addition to their primary avian host and, as such, have the potential of being a global zoonotic and pandemic threat. Migratory birds, especially waterfowl, are a natural reservoir of the avian influenza virus; they carry and exchange different virus strains along their migration routes, leading to antigenic drift and antigenic shift, which results in the emergence of novel HPAI viruses. This requires monitoring over time and in different locations to allow for the upkeep of relevant knowledge on avian influenza virus evolution and the prevention of novel epizootic and epidemic outbreaks. In this review, we assess the role of migratory birds in the spread and introduction of influenza strains on a global level, based on recent data. Our analysis sheds light on the details of viral dissemination linked to avian migration, the viral exchange between migratory waterfowl and domestic poultry, virus ecology in general, and viral evolution as a process tightly linked to bird migration. We also provide insight into methods used to detect and quantify avian influenza in the wild. This review may be beneficial for the influenza research community and may pave the way to novel strategies of avian influenza and HPAI zoonosis outbreak monitoring and prevention.},

The lack of a standardised detection method limits the estimation of fresh produce as an infection source. To support method development and standardisation, an extensive literature review and a multi-attribute assessment were performed to analyse the key aspects of published methods for the detection of T. gondii oocyst contamination in fresh produce. Seventy-seven published studies were included, with 14 focusing on fresh produce. Information gathered from expert laboratories via an online questionnaire were also included. Our findings show that procedures for oocyst recovery from fresh produce mostly involved sample washing and pelleting of the washing eluate by centrifugation, although washing procedures and buffers varied. DNA extraction procedures including mechanical or thermal shocks were identified as necessary steps to break the robust oocyst wall. The most suitable DNA detection protocols rely on qPCR, mostly targeting the B1 gene or the 529 bp repetitive element. When reported, validation data for the different detection methods were not comparable and none of the methods were supported by an interlaboratory comparative study. The results of this review will pave the way for an ongoing development of a widely applicable standard operating procedure.},

Regarding the latter habitat, it seems surprising how the plastic effects on benthic invertebrates are neglected since macroinvertebrates have a long tradition in the water quality assessment activities. In this context, we propose timely indoor observations on the exposure of caddisfly Odontocerum albicorne and mayfly Ephemera danica to various microplastic polymers (ABS, PET, PP, PS, PVDF). Three different experimental designs were performed on caddisflies and mayflies by exposing their larvae to natural and microplastic substrates. Our findings highlighted how microplastics affected both caddisflies in rebuilding its own case (after having removed the natural one) and mayflies burrowing. Particularly, all caddisflies rebuilt cases using the microplastic polymers provided instead of natural items only. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that mayflies burrow mainly in microplastic substrates rather than in natural ones. Our research highlights that macroinvertebrate larvae would use naturally occurring microplastics and this could be of particular concern in freshwaters with high contamination by plastics. Indeed, larvae appear to not necessarily perceive microplastics as a direct stressor. Further studies ought to be conducted to understand the chronic perturbation on larvae fitness and for example, on drift behaviour. Also, further investigations are needed to understand the potentialities of using plastics by benthic macroinvertebrates.},

The study of environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly becoming a valuable tool to survey and monitor aquatic communities. However, there are important gaps in our understanding of the dynamics governing the distribution of eDNA under natural conditions. In this report we carry out controlled experiments to assess the extent and timing of eDNA distribution along the water column. A sample of known eDNA concentration was placed at the bottom of a 5-m high tube (20 cm in diameter and total volume of 160 L), and water samples were obtained at different depths over an 8 h-period. The presence of the target eDNA was assessed by qPCR analysis. This sampling protocol allowed for assessing the timescale for the diffusion of eDNA while minimizing the influence of turbulence. We demonstrate that, after a time-period of as little as 30 min, the eDNA had spread across the entire container. The implications of these results for eDNA sampling protocols in the field are discussed.

Sediments of the studied canals exhibited some metal pollution. The hepatopancreas of the crayfish showed a higher concentration of trace metals in comparison to the other tissues at all sites under scrutiny. Concentrations of As and Pb, either in sediment and P. clarkii tissues, were probably related to the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Moreover, the levels of certain metals accumulated in the abdominal muscle (Pb, Cu and Zn) exceeded the threshold values considered harmful to human health. The Toxic Contamination Index, depending on the bioaccumulation data of hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle, allowed us to assess the toxicity by heavy metals of sediments measuring the stress level of the detoxification organ, and resulted in {\textgreater}1 only at two sampling canals. We hypothesize that P. clarkii in the Po River Delta aquatic communities can act as a vector of pollutants, as crayfish can transfer their relatively high amount of heavy metals to higher trophic levels.},

	abstract = {Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a harmful environmental pollutant, which is widely distributed in the marine environment. However, the mechanisms underlying Cr-induced oxidative stress and reproductive toxicity in clams remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to explore the acute toxic effects of Cr(VI) and estimate the applicability of male clam Geloina coaxans as a bioindicator in mangrove ecosystems. In this study, G. coaxans were exposed to 4.34, 8,69, 17.38 and 34.76 mg/L Cr(VI) for 24, 48 and 72 h. The activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined. The gene expression of CAT, GST, autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5), cyclin B3 and spermatogenesis associated protein 4 (SAP4) were measured by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, histological alteration of the gonad and sperm was observed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.The results showed that Cr(VI) exposure induced the accumulation of MDA and activities of enzymes. Cr(VI) exposure also inhibited the mRNA expression of ATG5, cyclin B3 and SAP4 in a dose-dependent manner, which might suggest that Cr(VI) caused reproductive toxicity by affecting gene expression. Significant changes in the histological structure of gonad were observed. The results demonstrate that Cr(VI) significantly affected functional and molecular parameters in Geloina coaxans, and indicate that gonad represents the target of exposure to Cr(VI).},

Ons het egter min geleer om ons inspirasie in die natuur te kry om leiers in ons komplekse wereld te wees. In die natuur is dit die spesie wat leer deur waar te neem, te luister, sin te maak, in te neem, te dink en op die regte tye te rus wat oorleef en floreer in hulle omgewings - op vlaktes, in berge, die bos, riviere, oseane, woestyne en die lug. Veg of vlug gebeur in beide die natuur en in besigheid. Uitdagings word gedeel in saambestaan, geduld, uithouvermoe, veerkragtigheid, en aanpassing. Leierskap uitdagings wat na vore kom in die nuwe wereld van die saambestaan van mens en masjien word ook verryk deur lesse uit die natuur wat nuwe gedrag inspireer. Hierdie lesse word nie in bestuurskole of kulturele nalatenskap geleer nie, maar in natuurlike oplossings wat vir miljoene jare plooibaar, effektief en doeltreffend is. Ons bespreek die grondslag van 'n konseptuele denkmodel van leierskap wat deur die natuur gei'nspireer is. Dit gee ? beginpunt om ? bewustheid te skep van hoe natuurgeinspireerde leierskap aangewend kan word. Enigiets wat vanuit die natuur gemodelleer word, moet verstaan word teen die agtergrond dat modelle vereenvoudigings is van die werklikheid in die natuur, wat n komplekse stelsel is, en dat dit nie ten volle verstaan word nie. Ons doelwit moet nooit wees om die natuur te kopieer nie, maar om beginsels daaruit te onttrek.Alternate abstract:"Go to the ant, ... consider its ways and be wise!" (Proverbs 6:6). We have progressed using biomimicry to inform our engineering designs and processes. Yet we have learnt very little in finding our inspiration from nature for leading in our complex world. In nature, those species that learn by observing, listening, making sense, internalising, thinking, and resting at the right time, survive and thrive in their environments - on plains, in mountains, in the bush, rivers, oceans, deserts, and the sky. Fight or flight takes place in both nature and business. Challenges are shared in coexistence, patience, perseverance, resilience, and adaptation. Leadership challenges that are emerging in the new world of human and machine coexistence will also be enriched by lessons from nature that inspire new behaviour, that are not conceived in business schools or legacy cultures, but that are flexible, effective, and work efficiently - as natural solutions have done for millennia. We discuss the makings of a conceptual thought model of leadership inspired by nature. It is a starting point to create an awareness of how nature-inspired leadership may be applied. Yet, when modelling anything on nature, one has to realise that all models are simplifications, which means that nature itself, as a complex system, is not fully understood. Our aim should not be to copy nature, but to extract principles from it.},

Results indicate that both energy acquisition and expenditure were significantly affected by season, site, and population factors. Scallop energy acquisition and growth efficiency were highest during the earlier, cooler part of the summer and higher at the Pacific site where food availability was highest. Significantly higher respiration rates were measured for the Pacific scallop population, leading to significantly lower net growth efficiency than scallops of Gulf origin, which indicates a physiological advantage for Gulf scallops during the suboptimal growth conditions present during summer months on both coasts of the Baja California peninsula. It may have important implications for aquaculture enterprises in this region, and may also confirm the genetic divergence between these two geographically separated populations. The advantages of the open-flow system for in situ ecophysiological studies in aquatic organisms are discussed.},

	abstract = {Geochemical analyses applied to lake sedimentary records can reveal the history of pollution by metals and the effects of remedial efforts. Lakes provide ideal environments for geochemical studies because they have steady deposition of fine grained material suitable for fixation of pollutants. The Laurentian Great Lakes are the most studied system in this field, and they have well-preserved chronological profiles. To date, this important system has been considered in parts for inorganic geochemistry, hampering basin-wide conclusions regarding metal contamination. We filled spatial and temporal gaps in a comprehensive geochemical analysis of 11 sediment cores collected from all five Great Lakes. Hierarchical cluster analysis of all Great Lakes samples divided the metal analytes into five functional groups: (1) carbonate elements; (2) metals and oxides with diverse natural sources, including a subgroup of analytes known to be anthropogenically enriched (Cd, Pb, Sn, Zn, and Sb); (3) common crustal elements; (4) metals related to coal and nuclear power generation; and (5) all of the co-occurring rare earth elements. Two contamination indices (Igeo and EF) applied to sedimentary metals indicated that Na, Co, Mn, Cd, Pb, Ta, and Cu were each, at some point during the Anthropocene, the most enriched metal pollutants in Great Lakes sediments. Land uses correlated with the metal analytes, such as increases in contaminant metals with the rise in catchment population and increases in carbonate elements (e.g. Ca) with agriculture. Certain contamination trends were observed basin-wide, such as for the atmospheric pollutant Pb, which followed a rise associated with fossil fuel combustion and a decline following the ban of leaded gasoline. Other trends were lake-specific, such as recent high concentrations of Na in Lake Superior, likely due to road salt applications, and a late-20th-century peak in Ca associated with algal whiting events in Lake Ontario. Some metals exceeded guidelines for sediment quality, in some cases prior to European settlement of the basin, indicating that a paleolimnological context is important for appropriate management of sediment contamination. The Great Lakes are sensitive to environmental changes such as pollution by metals, and it is clear that while there has been remedial success, results from the uppermost intervals of cores indicate ongoing problems.},

	abstract = {Marine bivalve hatchery productivity is continuously challenged by apparition and propagation of new diseases, mainly those related to vibriosis. Disinfectants and antibiotics are frequently overused to prevent pathogen presence, generating a potential negative impact on the environment. Recently, the use of highly diluted compounds with immunostimulant properties in marine organisms has been trailed successfully to activate the self-protection mechanisms of marine bivalves. Despite their potential as immunostimulants, little is known about their way of action. To understand their effect, a comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed with Argopecten ventricosus juveniles. The experimental design consisted of four treatments formulated from pathogenic Vibrio lysates at two dilutions: [(T1) Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus 1D; (T2) V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus 7C]; minerals [(T3) PhA+SiT 7C], scorpion venom [(T4) ViT 31C]; and one control (C1) hydro-alcoholic solution (ethanol 1\%). The RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis showed a higher modulation of differentially expressed genes (DEG) in mantle tissue compared to gill tissue. The scallops that showed a higher number of DEG related to immune response in mantle tissue corresponded to T1 (V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus lysate) and T3 (Silicea terra® - Phosphoric acid®). The transcriptome analysis allowed understanding some interactions between A. ventricosus juveniles and highly-diluted treatments.},

	abstract = {Organisms have evolved various physiological mechanisms to cope with unfavourable environmental conditions. The ability to tolerate non-optimal thermal conditions can be substantially improved by acclimation. In this study, we examined how an early-life acclimation to different temperatures (19 °C, 25 °C and 29 °C) influences thermal reaction norms for energy stores in Drosophila adults. Our results show that acclimation temperature has a significant effect on the amount of stored fat and glycogen (and their relative changes) and the optimal temperature for their accumulation. Individuals acclimated to 19 °C had, on average, more energy reserves than flies that were initially maintained at 25 °C or 29 °C. In addition, acclimation caused a shift in optimal temperature for energy stores towards acclimation temperature. We also detected significant population differences in this response. The effect of acclimation on the optimal temperature for energy stores was more pronounced in flies from the temperate climate zone (Slovakia) than in individuals from the tropical zone (India). Overall, we found that the acclimation effect was stronger after acclimation to low (19 °C) than to high (29 °C) temperature. The observed sensitivity of thermal reaction norms for energy reserves to acclimation temperature can have important consequences for surviving periods of food scarcity, especially at suboptimal temperatures.},

	abstract = {Quality checks, assessments, and the assurance of food products, raw materials, and food ingredients is critically important to ensure the safeguard of foods of high quality for safety and public health. Nevertheless, quality checks, assessments, and the assurance of food products along distribution and supply chains is impacted by various challenges. For instance, the development of portable, sensitive, low-cost, and robust instrumentation that is capable of real-time, accurate, and sensitive analysis, quality checks, assessments, and the assurance of food products in the field and/or in the production line in a food manufacturing industry is a major technological and analytical challenge. Other significant challenges include analytical method development, method validation strategies, and the non-availability of reference materials and/or standards for emerging food contaminants. The simplicity, portability, non-invasive, non-destructive properties, and low-cost of NIR spectrometers, make them appealing and desirable instruments of choice for rapid quality checks, assessments and assurances of food products, raw materials, and ingredients. This review article surveys literature and examines current challenges and breakthroughs in quality checks and the assessment of a variety of food products, raw materials, and ingredients. Specifically, recent technological innovations and notable advances in quartz crystal microbalances (QCM), electroanalytical techniques, and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic instrument development in the quality assessment of selected food products, and the analysis of food raw materials and ingredients for foodborne pathogen detection between January 2019 and July 2020 are highlighted. In addition, chemometric approaches and multivariate analyses of spectral data for NIR instrumental calibration and sample analyses for quality assessments and assurances of selected food products and electrochemical methods for foodborne pathogen detection are discussed.

The activity of potential offenders affects the crime patterns, but the data with fine resolution have not been applied in the crime prediction. The goal of this study is to test the effect of the activity of potential offenders in the crime prediction by combining this data in the prediction models and assessing the prediction accuracies. This study uses the movement data of past offenders collected in routine police stop-and-question operations to infer the movement of future offenders. The offender movement data compensates historical crime data in a Spatio-Temporal Cokriging (ST-Cokriging) model for crime prediction. The models are implemented for weekly, biweekly, and quad-weekly prediction in the XT police district of ZG city, China. Results with the incorporation of the offender movement data are consistently better than those without it. The improvement is most pronounced for the weekly model, followed by the biweekly model, and the quad-weekly model. In sum, the addition of offender movement data enhances crime prediction, especially for short periods.},

	abstract = {Background 
Homeobox-containing genes encode crucial transcription factors involved in animal, plant and fungal development, and changes to homeobox genes have been linked to the evolution of novel body plans and morphologies. In animals, some homeobox genes are clustered together in the genome, either as remnants from ancestral genomic arrangements, or due to coordinated gene regulation. Consequently, analyses of homeobox gene organization across animal phylogeny provide important insights into the evolution of genome organization and developmental gene control, and their interaction. However, homeobox gene organization remains to be fully elucidated in several key animal ancestors, including those of molluscs, lophotrochozoans and bilaterians.
Results
NA
Conclusions
The analyses performed in this study and the accompanying genome sequence provide important genetic resources for this economically and culturally valuable oyster species, and offer a platform to improve understanding of animal biology and evolution more generally. Transposable element content is comparable to that found in other mollusc species, contrary to the conclusion of another recent analysis. Also, our chromosome-level assembly allows the inference of ancient gene linkages (synteny) for the homeobox-containing genes, even though a number of the homeobox gene clusters, like the Hox/ParaHox clusters, are undergoing dispersal in molluscs such as this oyster.},

Since many coastal Mediterranean areas suffer from great anthropomorphic pressure, the aim of this study was to assess the level of potentially toxic inorganic elements in different fish samples from the coastal zone of Southern Italy (Gela) where there is a high mortality rate linked to cancer disease and congenital malformations. The presence of mercury, cadmium, lead, nickel, arsenic, vanadium, and chromium was measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The risk assessment was evaluated in terms of estimated daily intake by calculating the amount of potentially toxic elements that an average individual adult weighing 60 kg would ingest. Moreover the non-carcinogenic risk was estimated by target hazard quotient (THQ). The study evidenced significant contamination by inorganic elements, especially cadmium, which can be linked to industrial pollution. The THQ indexes, as indicators of human health, suggest that the consumption of fish from the study area is not free of risk.},

	abstract = {An analysis of patterns of convergent evolution on Earth that suggests where we might look for similar convergent forms on other planets. 
Why does a sea lily look like a palm tree? And why is a sea lily called a "lily" when it is a marine animal and not a plant? Many marine animals bear a noticeable similarity in form to land-dwelling plants. And yet these marine animal forms evolved in the oceans first; land plants independently and convergently evolved similar forms much later in geologic time. In this book, George McGhee analyzes patterns of convergent evolution on Earth and argues that these patterns offer lessons for the search for life elsewhere in the universe.
Our Earth is a water world; 71 percent of the earth's surface is covered by water. The fossil record shows that multicellular life on dry land is a new phenomenon; for the vast majority of the earth's history--3,500 million years of its 4,560 million years of existence--complex life existed only in the oceans. Explaining that convergent biological evolution occurs because of limited evolutionary pathways, McGhee examines examples of convergent evolution in forms of feeding, immobility and mobility, defense, and organ systems. McGhee suggests that the patterns of convergent evolution that we see in our own water world indicate the potential for similar convergent forms in other water worlds. We should search for extraterrestrial life on water worlds, and for technological life on water worlds with continental landmasses.},

	abstract = {Due to the non-biodegradability of plastic substances, coupled with poor waste management practices, plastic pollution has become a major environmental issue within the past decade. However, the negative effects of plastic pollution are rarely opposed, or the solutions proposed are costly or still damaging to the environment. New strategies must be undertaken to prevent irreparable environmental damage from disposable plastic products while maintaining and maximizing the benefits of plastics in specialized cases, such as medicine and public health. The Handbook of Research on Environmental and Human Health Impacts of Plastic Pollution is a collection of innovative research that assesses the negative impacts of plastic on the environment, human health, and ecosystems, and explores biotechnological approaches to solve plastic pollution. While highlighting topics including medical wastes, biodegradability, and phthalate exposure, this publication intends to provide readers with the latest solutions for reducing the burden of plastic on the environment. It is ideally designed for environmentalists, policymakers, instructors, researchers, graduate-level students, industrialists, and non-governmental organization professionals seeking current research on health and ecosystem concerns from the overconsumption of plastics.},

	abstract = {Growth and development pressures in the City of Toronto and the surrounding region have led to the approval of a novel "cottage condo" development called Friday Harbour Resort. Marketed as the "Hamptons of Toronto," the resort's approval was contingent on a tenureship clause that restricts owners from occupying units for more than 300 days per year. As a public resort, the development introduces a significant amount of publicly accessible space to the town of Innisfil, where it is located. Through qualitative research, this article examines publicly accessible spaces at Friday Harbour Resort and contributes to the empirical research on public space in peripheries, highlighting potential social and spatial implications of this new "cottage-condo" trend in second home suburbanization.Alternate abstract:Les pressions exercées par la croissance et le développement dans la ville de Toronto et de la région environnante ont conduit a l'approbation d'un nouveau type de développement de ?cottage condo/ chalets-condos? appelé Friday Harbour Resort.

	abstract = {Healthy waterways and oceans are essential for our increasingly urbanised world. Yet monitoring water quality in aquatic environments is a challenge, as it varies from hour to hour due to stormwater and currents. Being at the base of the aquatic food web and present in huge numbers, plankton are strongly influenced by changes in environment and provide an indication of water quality integrated over days and weeks. Plankton are the aquatic version of a canary in a coal mine. They are also vital for our existence, providing not only food for fish, seabirds, seals and sharks, but producing oxygen, cycling nutrients, processing pollutants, and removing carbon dioxide from our atmosphere. 
This second edition of
Plankton is a fully updated introduction to the biology, ecology and identification of plankton and their use in monitoring water quality. It includes expanded, illustrated descriptions of all major groups of freshwater, coastal and marine phytoplankton and zooplankton and a new chapter on teaching science using plankton. Best practice methods for plankton sampling and monitoring programs are presented using case studies, along with explanations of how to analyse and interpret sampling data.

Plankton is an invaluable reference for teachers and students, environmental managers, ecologists, estuary and catchment management committees, and coastal engineers.},

We used 57 years of lockchamber fish rotenone and boat electrofishing survey data (1957-2014) collected by the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO) to test for directional trajectories in taxonomy, trophic classifications, and life history strategies of freshwater fish assemblages in the Ohio River Basin. We found significant changes in taxonomic and trophic composition of freshwater fishes in the Ohio River Basin. Annual species richness varied from 31 to 90 species and generally increased with year. Temporal trajectories were present for taxonomic and trophic assemblages. Assemblage structure based on taxonomy was correlated with land use change (decrease in agriculture and increase in forest). Taxonomic assemblage structure was also correlated with altered hydrology variables of increased minimum discharge, decreased fall rate, and increased rise rate. Trophic composition of fish catch correlated with land use change (decrease in agriculture and increase in forest) and altered hydrology. Altered hydrology of increased minimum discharge, increased fall discharge, decreased base flows, and increased number of high pulse events was correlated with increased counts of herbivore-detritivores and decreased counts of piscivores and planktivores. We did not find directional changes in life history composition. We hypothesized a shift occurred from benthic to phytoplankton production throughout the basin that may have decreased secondary production of benthic invertebrates. This may also be responsible for lower trophic position of invertivore and piscivore fishes observed in other studies.},

	abstract = {We compared the validity of two low cost camera systems to analyze the filtration activity of Diplodon chilensis (Gray, 1828), the most common freshwater bivalve in southern Chile, by using time lapse photography. One camera system (Nikon D300) was connected with an external flash, whereas the other system (GoPro Hero 3+) contained a permanent video light source. Size change of the exhalant siphon area (ESA) of Diplodon individuals was used to track activity changes over time. The siphon of D. chilensis was completely closed for 3.4 \% ± 5.2 \% (mean ± SD) of the recording time and it shows a nearly completely opened siphon for 42.7 \% ± 22.9 \% of the recording time. The mean siphon opening was 68.3 \% ± 26.5 \% of its potential opening area. Although a red filter was placed in front of the video light source, the mobile fauna, especially Aegla abtao (Schmitt, 1942) and unidentified small fishes were highly attracted by the permanent light. We conclude that both low cost cameras are very suitable for in situ time lapse observation of freshwater clams since both deliver good image quality. However, special attention should be given to the light source since permanent light attracts animals including predators which might change filtration activity of D. chilensis.Alternate abstract:Comparamos la validez de dos sistemas de cámara de bajo costo para analizar la actividad de filtración de Diplodon chilensis (Gray, 1828), el bivalvo de agua dulce más común en el Sur de Chile, usando fotografía de lapso de tiempo. Un sistema de cámara (Nikon D300) se conectó con un flash externo, mientras que el otro sistema (GoPro Hero 3+) contenía una fuente de luz de vídeo permanente. El sifón de D. chilensis fue completamente cerrado por 3.4 \% ± 5.2 \% (media ± desviación estándar) del tiempo de grabación y muestra un sifón casi completamente abierto durante 42.7 \% ± 22.9 \% del tiempo de grabación. La apertura media del sifón fue de 68.3 \% ± 26.5 \% de su área de apertura potencial. Aunque un filtro rojo se colocó frente a la fuente de luz de vídeo, la fauna móvil, especialmente Aegla abtao (Schmitt, 1942) y los peces pequeños no identificados, fueron fuertemente atraídos por la luz permanente. Concluimos que ambas cámaras son adecuadas para la observación in situ de fotografía en lapso de tiempo de las almejas de agua dulce, ya que ambas ofrecen una buena calidad de imagen. Sin embargo, se debe prestar especial atención a la fuente de luz, ya que la luz permanente atrae a los animales, incluidos los depredadores, que podrían cambiar la actividad de filtración de D. chilensis.},

The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of EHDAB were investigated in two aquatic animals, the larvae of midge (Chironomus riparius) and crucian carp (Carassius carassius), and the metabolic enzyme responses in fish liver were determined. EHDAB in the larvae of midge reached a steady state within 10 days of sediment exposure. The biota-sediment accumulation factors ranged from 0.10 to 0.54, and were inversely proportional to the exposure concentrations. The EHDAB-contaminated larvae were used to feed the crucian carp. Within 28 days of feeding exposure, the EHDAB levels in fish tissues gradually increased with the increase of the exposure concentration, exhibiting an apparent concentration-dependence and time-dependence. The liver and kidneys were the main organs of accumulation, and the biomagnification factors of EHDAB ranged from 8.97 to 11.0 and 6.44 to 10.8, respectively. In addition, EHDAB significantly increased the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A, CYP3A and glutathione S-transferase in the fish liver. Our results indicate that EHDAB may pose a risk of biomagnification in an aquatic environment and influence the biological processes of exposed organisms.},

	abstract = {The characterization of temporal and spatial patterns in phosphorus (P) loading in Lake Erie is essential in order to continue monitoring the excessive P condition that comes from the western Lake Erie Basin. This study aims to perform such a characterization using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) methods. These wavelet transformations were conducted on streamflow data, TP loads, and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) of six stations located near Lake Erie of Northern Ohio. These stations are located near the outlet of Cuyahoga, Grand, Maumee, Vermilion, Raisin, and Sandusky watersheds. Long-term continuous P loading data, in which some dated back to 1970, were used in the analysis. The results obtained from the CWT and DWT approaches were found to complement each other. Streamflow had significant mixed variability at 1, 2, and 4 years. The variability for SRP was limited to 1 and 2 years while the TP variability was only seen at the 1-year scale. It was interesting to find that strong temporal patterns of SRP were observed in most of the watersheds only after the mid-1990s. The CWT wavelet spectra also reflected the land use characteristics of each watershed. For example, the wavelet spectra of surface runoff and TP for the agricultural watersheds (i.e., Raisin, Sandusky, and Maumee Rivers) were similar and characterized by significant variability primarily at the annual scale and at the two to four-year periodicities. The urbanized watershed (i.e., Cuyahoga River) did not show any association between either phosphorus (TP or SRP) with surface runoff and baseflow, which indicates that P in the urbanized watershed was not driven by the flow.},

	abstract = {The aerial and ground methods of counting birds in a coastal area during different ice conditions were compared. Ice coverage of water was an important factor affecting the results of the two methods. When the water was ice-free, more birds were counted from the ground, whereas during ice conditions, higher numbers were obtained from the air. The first group of waterbirds with the smallest difference between the two methods (average 6\%) contained seven species: Mute Swan Cygnus olor, Whooper Swan Cygnus cygnus, Greater Scaup Aythya marila, Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula, Common Goldeneye Bucephala clangula, Smew Mergellus albellus and Goosander Mergus merganser; these were treated as the core group. The second group with a moderate difference (average 20\%) included another six species: Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Eurasian Wigeon Mareca penelope, Common Pochard Aythya ferina, Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus and Eurasian Coot Fulica atra. The third group with a large difference (average 85\%) included five species, all of the Anatini tribe: Gadwall Mareca strepera, Northern Pintail Anas acuta, Northern Shoveler Spatula clypeata, Eurasian Teal Anas crecca and Garganey Spatula querquedula. During ice conditions, smaller numbers of most species were counted from the ground. The exception here was Mallard, more of which were counted from the ground, but the difference between two methods was relatively small in this species (7.5\%). Under ice-free conditions, both methods can be used interchangeably for the most numerous birds occupying open water (core group) without any significant impact on the results. When water areas are frozen over, air counts are preferable as the results are more reliable. The cost analysis shows that a survey carried out by volunteer observers (reimbursement of travel expenses only) from the land is 58\% cheaper, but if the observers are paid, then an aerial survey is 40\% more economical.},

	abstract = {River damming causes a decrease in water current velocity which leads to an increase in richness and abundance of organisms atypical for running waters. Zooplankton is a representative example of such organisms. The influx of zooplankton from carp ponds is an additional factor that increases richness and abundance of zooplankton in rivers. We hypothesized that zooplankton dispersing from the carp ponds colonize the impoundments in river and the richness of zooplankton increase in impoundments by development of new species, not observed in the upstream. The zooplankton was collected monthly from April to September of 2013 and 2014. Sampling sites were located in the Barycz river (in the lotic sections and in the dam impoundments), as well as in its tributaries, which are the outlets of carp ponds. The most changes in zooplankton richness and abundance were observed at sites located within the dam impoundments, especially in relation to the lower values of the current velocity. Since the abundance of pelagic rotifers, cladocerans and copepods in the carp pond outlets was similar to that at lower sites in the Barycz, the influence of the carp pond outlets on the abundance in the dam and lotic sections was significant. The river itself in its impounded sections provides advantageous conditions for retention and colonization by a high abundance of zooplankton dispersing from the carp ponds, and for the development of species not occurred in the upstream, which, in turn, increases richness.},

	doi = {10.3897/zookeys.801.23677},
	abstract = {In isopods, parental care takes the form of offspring brooding in marsupial pouches. Marsupial brooding was an important step towards the origin of terrestrial lifestyles among isopods, but its potential role in shaping isopod life histories remains unknown. It is here considered that marsupial brooding imposes costs and creates a temporary association between the survival of mothers and that of their offspring. Integrating findings from different life history models, we predicted that the effects of marsupial brooding set selective conditions for the continuation of growth after maturation, which leads to indeterminate growth, and the production of larger offspring by larger females. Based on this perspective, a study on the size dependence of offspring production in the woodlouse  Porcellio scaber  was performed and the generality of the results was tested by reviewing the literature on offspring production in other isopods. In  P. scaber  and almost all the other studied isopods, clutch size is positively related to female size. Such dependence is a necessary pre-condition for the evolution of indeterminate growth. The body mass of  P. scaber  differed six-fold between the largest and smallest brooding females, indicating a high potential for post-maturation growth. Our review showed that offspring size is a rarely studied trait in isopods and that it correlates negatively with offspring number but positively with female size in nearly half of the studied species. Our study of  P. scaber  revealed similar patterns, but the positive effect of female size on offspring size occurred only in smaller broods, and the negative relation between clutch size and offspring size occurred only in larger females. We conclude that the intraspecific patterns of offspring production in isopods agree with theoretical predictions regarding the role of offspring brooding in shaping the adaptive patterns of female investment in growth, reproduction, and the parental care provided to individual offspring.},

	abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems have the greatest species diversity per unit area and many endangered species. This book shows that, rather than being a marginal part of terrestrial protected area management, freshwater conservation is central to sustaining biodiversity. It focuses on better practices for conserving inland aquatic ecosystems in protected areas, including rivers, wetlands, peatlands, other freshwater and brackish ecosystems, and estuaries. The authors define inland aquatic ecosystems, showing just how diverse and widespread they are. They examine the principles and processes that are essential for the conservation of freshwater ecosystems and aquatic species. Major categories of threats to freshwater ecosystems and the flow-on implications for protected area design are described. Practical case studies are used to illustrate principles and practices applied around the world. Specific management needs of the main types of freshwater ecosystems are considered, as well as the management of freshwaters in the broader landscape, showing how natural resource governance processes can be harnessed to better manage freshwater biodiversity. The book offers commentary on how to adapt freshwater conservation practices to climate change and ends with an insightful synthesis.},

Notre territoire a connu une histoire climatologique contrastée, où se sont alternées extinctions d'espèces et périodes de reconstruction. Ce que nous appelons « nature », en France, est en réalité le produit des activités humaines et de processus écologiques spontanés depuis des milliers d'années.
La déforestation, l'agriculture, les aménagements des cours d'eau et des zones humides, les introductions d'espèces ont créé des milieux artificialisés, gérés pour des usages variés. L'homme n'a pas détruit la diversité biologique en métropole, mais il l'a transformée et enrichie. À partir de cette affirmation, l'auteur pose la question du pilotage des dynamiques de cette nature, soumise à de nouvelles pratiques agricoles, à l'urbanisation, au réchauffement climatique. Quels compromis sont possibles pour contrôler les facteurs qui nuisent à nos activités et à notre cadre de vie (ravageurs de cultures, vecteurs de maladies...), tout en préservant un riche patrimoine d'espèces et de paysages auquel nous sommes attachés ?
Dans ce contexte, qu'entend-on par « érosion de la biodiversité » ? Quand on modifie un système écologique, on perd des espèces, mais on peut en favoriser d'autres. Pour construire une gestion future de la biodiversité compréhensible par tous, il faut sortir du « prêt-à-penser » catastrophiste et tenir compte aussi des succès dans nos relations avec la nature.

The ability to cope with low salinity stress is quite important for the survival of aquatic species under natural conditions. In this study, the transcriptional response of the Manila clam to low salinity stress was characterized using RNA sequencing. The transcriptomes of a low salinity-treatment group (FRp1, FRp2), which survived under low salinity stress, and control group (SRp1, SRp2), which was not subjected to low salinity stress, were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq platform. A total of 196,578 unigenes were generated. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that signal transduction, immune response, cellular component organization or biogenesis, and energy production processes were the most highly enriched pathways among the genes that were differentially expressed under low salinity stress. All these pathways could be assigned to the following biological functions in the low salinity tolerant Manila clam: signal response to low salinity stress, antioxidant response, intracellular free amino acid transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, cell signaling pathways, and regulation of ionic content and cell volume. In summary, this is the first study using high-throughput sequencing to identify gene targets that could explain osmotic regulation mechanisms under salinity stress in R. philippinarum.},

For this purpose, 120 fishes were used as experimental samples and exposed to 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg/L of Cu nanoparticles for 21 days, and 30 fishes assumed as the experiment control. The mean water temperature of the aquaria was 22±2 °C, dissolved oxygen 5.2 mg/L, pH at 7±0.004 and the concentration of calcium carbonate was 270 ppm. On 7, 14 and 21 days after exposing the fishes to copper nanoparticles, three fishes were randomly selected from each aquaria, sacrificed and samples from their gill, liver and kidney were taken and fixed in cold 10 \% buffered formalin. Then microscopic sections were prepared and examined by light microscope which showed histological alternations in the gill, liver and kidney tissues. Evaluation of these changes could be useful in estimating the harmful effects of copper nanoparticles. Histological alternation in gills included: hyperplasia, fusion and detachment of secondary lamellae, blood congestion in vascular axis of primary filaments, reduced secondary lamellae length and cellular degeneration. Histological changes in liver included blood congestion in the central veins, cytoplasmic vacuolation of the hepatocytes, cellular degeneration and congestion in the blood sinusoids and necrosis of the hepatocytes. Histological changes in kidneys included glomerular shrinkage, severe degeneration in the tubules cells, interstitial tissue and glomerulus, increase in interstitial tissue cells and macrophages aggregation. The degree of damages was more intensive at higher copper nanoparticles concentrations. The result of the study showed that copper nanoparticles could cause severe damages in the vital tissues of Caspian roach; Rutillus rutillus caspicus and have lethal effects for fish.},

	abstract = {Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the ocean are of key importance for pelagic fixed-nitrogen loss (N-loss) through microbial denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Recent studies document that zooplankton is surprisingly abundant in and around OMZs and that the microbial community associated with carcasses of a large copepod species mediates denitrification. Here, we investigate the complex N-cycling associated with sinking zooplankton carcasses exposed to the steep O2 gradient in a coastal OMZ (Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica). 15N-stable-isotope enrichment experiments revealed that the carcasses of abundant copepods and ostracods provide anoxic microbial hotspots in the pelagic zone by hosting intense anaerobic N-cycle activities even in the presence of ambient O2. Carcass-associated anaerobic N-cycling was clearly dominated by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) at up to 30.8 nmol NH4+ individual-1 d-1, followed by denitrification (up to 10.8 nmol N2-N individual-1 d-1), anammox (up to 1.6 nmol N2-N individual-1 d-1), and N2O production (up to 1.2 nmol N2O-N individual-1 d-1). In contrast, anaerobic N-cycling mediated by free-living bacteria proceeded mainly through anammox and denitrification in the anoxic bottom water, which underpins the distinctive microbial metabolism associated with zooplankton carcasses. Pelagic N-loss is potentially enhanced by zooplankton carcasses both directly through N2 and N2O production, and indirectly through NH4+ production that may fuel free-living anammox bacteria. We estimate that in the hypoxic water layer of Golfo Dulce, carcass-associated N2 and N2O production enhance N-loss as much as 1.4-fold at a relative carcass abundance of 36\%. In the anoxic bottom water, however, N-loss is likely enhanced only marginally due to high ambient rates and low zooplankton abundance. Thus, zooplankton carcasses may enhance N-loss mainly at the hypoxic boundaries of OMZs which are usually more extensive in open-ocean than in coastal settings. Notably, these contributions by zooplankton carcasses to pelagic N-loss remain undetected by conventional, incubation-based rate measurements.},

We describe aspects of phero-perception, stress responses, immune function and regulation of gene expression that support the persistence of B. glabrata in the field and may define this species as a suitable snail host for S. mansoni.

Now that Congress has mandated the restoration of the Everglades . . . this book will provide researchers as well as the general public with an understanding of what the Everglades were like prior to drainage and how humans utilized this natural wonder."--Randolph J. Widmer, University of Houston Originally prepared as a report for the National Park Service in 1988, Griffin's work places the human occupation of the Everglades within the context of South Florida's unique natural environmental systems. He documents, for the first time, the little known but relatively extensive precolumbian occupation of the interior portion of the region and surveys the material culture of the Glades area. He also provides an account of the evolution of the region's climate and landscape and a history of previous archaeological research in the area and fuses ecological and material evidence into a discussion of the sequence and distribution of cultures, social organization, and lifeways of the Everglades inhabitants. Milanich and Miller have transformed Griffin's report into an accessible, comprehensive overview of Everglades archaeology for specialists and the general public. Management plans have been removed, maps redrawn, and updates added. The result is a synthesis of the archaeology of a region that is taking center stage as various state and federal agencies cooperate to restore the health of this important ecosystem, one of the nation's most renowned natural areas and one that has been designated a World Heritage Site and a Wetland of International Importance. This book will make a key work in Florida archaeology more readily available as a springboard for future research and will also, at last, allow John Griffin's contribution to south Florida archaeology to be more widely appreciated.John W. Griffin, a pioneer in Florida archaeology, was an archaeologist for both the Florida Park Service and the National Park Service (NPS), director of the NPS Southeast Archeological Center in Macon, Georgia, and director of the St. Augustine Preservation Board. Jerald T. Milanich is emeritus professor at the University of Florida/Florida Museum of Natural History and author of numerous books about the native peoples of the Southeast United States. James J.

"A decision was made by MODL to acquire land on Sherbrooke Lake to provide for public access/use.

"MODC is both surprised and discouraged that MODL purchased land in our municipality to provide public access to Sherbrooke Lake without discussing the same with us first."

The deal commits to public access for all, despite concerns from cottage owners about pollution, garbage and safety if boat traffic increases.

In a November 2013 letter, Coolican said access would allow "impacts on water quality, noise, garbage, the importation of invasive organisms such as zebra mussels, security, the protection of privately owned beaches, and boating accidents on the water."

[...]it also showed many, particularly lake property owners, were concerned "about the risk of disturbance, theft, littering, or vandalism if a public space is opened on Sherbrooke Lake."},

Large variations in population abundance can threaten the constancy and the persistence stability of ecological populations, which may impede the success and efficiency of managing natural resources. Here, we consider population models that include biological mechanisms characteristic for causing extinctions on the one hand and pest outbreaks on the other hand. These models include Allee effects and the impact of natural enemies (as is typical of forest defoliating insects). We study the impacts of noise and different levels of biological parameters in three extinction and two outbreak scenarios. Our results show that ALC and ATH have an effect on extinction and outbreak risks only for sufficiently large control intensities. Moreover, there is a clear disparity between the two control methods: in the extinction scenarios, ALC can be effective and ATH can be counterproductive, whereas in the outbreak scenarios the situation is reversed, with ATH being effective and ALC being potentially counterproductive.},

Moreover, nanomaterial research has led to reports of a possible relationship between the morphological characteristics of a nanomaterial and the magnitude of its delivered toxicity. However, conventional synthesis of nanoparticles requires harsh chemicals and costly energy consumption. Additionally, the exact relationship between toxicity and morphology of nanomaterials has not been well established.

Metabolite profiles have the potential to identify exposure or toxicity before populations are disrupted and can provide useful information for environmental assessment.

In the current study, we use LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) and GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) to measure metabolites of the midge Procladius villosimanus inhabiting 21 urban wetlands. These metabolites were tested against common sediment contaminants using random forest models and metabolite enrichment analysis. Sediment contaminant concentrations in the field correlated with several P. villosimanus metabolites despite natural environmental and organismal variation. Furthermore, enrichment analysis indicated that metabolite sets implicated in stress responses were enriched, pointing to specific cellular functions affected by exposure. Methionine metabolism, sugar metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism associated with total petroleum hydrocarbon and metal concentrations, while mitochondrial electron transport and urea cycle sets associated only with bifenthrin. These results demonstrate the potential for metabolomics approaches to provide useful information in field-based environmental assessments.},

	abstract = {Phytoplankton pigments absorb sunlight for photosynthesis, protect the chloroplast from damage caused by excess light energy, and influence the color of the water. Some pigments act as bio-markers and are important for separation of phytoplankton functional types. Among many efforts that have been made to obtain information on phytoplankton pigments from bio-optical properties, Gaussian curves decomposed from phytoplankton absorption spectrum have been used to represent the light absorption of different pigments. We incorporated the Gaussian scheme into a semi-analytical model and obtained the Gaussian curves from remote sensing reflectance. In this study, a series of sensitivity tests were conducted to explore the potential of obtaining the Gaussian curves from multi-spectral satellite remote sensing. Results showed that the Gaussian curves can be retrieved with 35\% or less mean unbiased absolute percentage differences from MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-like sensors. Further, using Lake Erie as an example, the spatial distribution of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations were obtained from the Gaussian curves and used as metrics for the spatial extent of an intense cyanobacterial bloom occurred in Lake Erie in 2014. The seasonal variations of Gaussian absorption properties in 2011 were further obtained from MERIS imagery. This study shows that it is feasible to obtain Gaussian curves from multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data, and the obtained chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations from these Gaussian peak heights demonstrated potential application to monitor harmful algal blooms (HABs) and identification of phytoplankton groups from satellite ocean color remote sensing semi-analytically.},

	abstract = {Nodularin (NOD) is a cyclic penta-peptide hepatotoxin mainly produced by Nodularia spumigena, reported from the brackish water bodies of various parts of the world. It can accumulate in the food chain and, for safety reasons, levels of NOD not only in water bodies but also in food matrices are of interest. Here, we report on a non-competitive immunoassay for the specific detection of NOD. A phage display technique was utilized to interrogate a synthetic antibody phage library for binders recognizing NOD bound to an anti-ADDA (3-Amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4(E),6(E)-dienoic acid) monoclonal antibody (Mab). One of the obtained immunocomplex binders, designated SA32C11, showed very high specificity towards nodularin-R (NOD-R) over to the tested 10 different microcystins (microcystin-LR, -dmLR, -RR, -dmRR, -YR, -LY, -LF, -LW, -LA, -WR). It was expressed in Escherichia coli as a single chain antibody fragment (scFv) fusion protein and used to establish a time-resolved fluorometry-based assay in combination with the anti-ADDA Mab. The detection limit (blank + 3SD) of the immunoassay, with a total assay time of 1 h 10 min, is 0.03 µg/L of NOD-R. This represents the most sensitive immunoassay method for the specific detection of NOD reported so far. The assay was tested for its performance to detect NOD using spiked (0.1 to 3 µg/L of NOD-R) water samples including brackish sea and coastal water and the recovery ranged from 79 to 127\%. Furthermore, a panel of environmental samples, including water from different sources, fish and other marine tissue specimens, were analyzed for NOD using the assay. The assay has potential as a rapid screening tool for the analysis of a large number of water samples for the presence of NOD. It can also find applications in the analysis of the bioaccumulation of NOD in marine organisms and in the food chain.},

	abstract = {Background 
Taxonomy offers precise species identification and delimitation and thus provides basic information for biological research, e.g. through assessment of species richness. The importance of molecular taxonomy, i.e., the identification and delimitation of taxa based on molecular markers, has increased in the past decade. Recently developed exploratory tools now allow estimating species-level diversity in multi-locus molecular datasets.
Results
Here we use molecular species delimitation tools that either quantify differences in intra- and interspecific variability of loci, or divergence times within and between species, or perform coalescent species tree inference to estimate species-level entities in molecular genetic datasets. We benchmark results from these methods against 14 morphologically readily differentiable species of a well-defined subgroup of the diverse Drusinae subfamily (Trichoptera, Limnephilidae). Using a 3798 bp (6 loci) molecular data set we aim to corroborate a geographically isolated new species by integrating comparative morphological studies and molecular taxonomy.
Conclusions
Our results indicate that only multi-locus species delimitation provides taxonomically relevant information. The data further corroborate the new species Drusus zivici sp. nov. We provide differential diagnostic characters and describe the male, female and larva of this new species and discuss diversity patterns of Drusinae in the Balkans. We further discuss potential and significance of molecular species delimitation. Finally we argue that enhancing collaborative integrative taxonomy will accelerate assessment of global diversity and completion of reference libraries for applied fields, e.g., conservation and biomonitoring.},

	abstract = {Global trade facilitates the inadvertent movement of insect pests and subsequent establishment of populations outside their native ranges. Despite phytosanitary measures, nonnative insects arrive at United States (U.S.) ports of entry as larvae in solid wood packaging material (SWPM). Identification of wood-boring larval insects is important for pest risk analysis and management, but is difficult beyond family level due to highly conserved morphology. Therefore, we integrated DNA barcoding and rearing of larvae to identify wood-boring insects in SWPM. From 2012 to 2015, we obtained larvae of 338 longhorned beetles (Cerambycidae) and 38 metallic wood boring beetles (Buprestidae) intercepted in SWPM associated with imported products at six U.S. ports. We identified 265 specimens to species or genus using DNA barcodes. Ninety-three larvae were reared to adults and identified morphologically. No conflict was found between the two approaches, which together identified 275 cerambycids (23 genera) and 16 buprestids (4 genera). Our integrated approach confirmed novel DNA barcodes for seven species (10 specimens) of woodborers not in public databases. This study demonstrates the utility of DNA barcoding as a tool for regulatory agencies. We provide important documentation of potential beetle pests that may cross country borders through the SWPM pathway.},

Despite the overfishing threat on the wedge clam Donax trunculus in Europe, relatively little information is known about its population genetic structure and connectivity and their consequences on conservation policies. We employed 16 microsatellite loci to characterise the genetic diversity and population structure of D. trunculus. A total of 514 samples from seven different localities along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition, from the Atlantic (Gulf of Cádiz) to the north-western Mediterranean were genotyped. The analysis of the population genetic structure displayed a clear distinction along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition with different clusters in the Atlantic Ocean, the Alboran Sea and the northwestern Mediterranean. Consequently, we recommend that these three areas should be considered as different management units. We showed that all populations seem to be at high long-term risk of extinction with the exception of the protected Doñana National Park population which still seems to have evolutionary potential. Therefore, our results emphasized the necessity of protection of this economic resource and the validity of molecular tools to evaluate the population dynamics.},

In spite of advances in hull coating technology, a ship must usually undergo underwater hull cleaning to remove biofouling during her in-service time. However, some cleaning practices may also lead to decreased lifetime of the fouling-control coating. Therefore, cleaning forces should be minimized, according to the adhesion strength of marine organisms present on the hull. In this article, values of adhesion strength found in available literature are discussed in the light of current knowledge on hull cleaning technology. Finally, the following knowledge gaps are identified: (1) data on adhesion strength of naturally-occurring biofouling communities are practically absent; (2) shear forces imparted by current cleaning devices on low-form fouling (microfouling) and corresponding effects on hull coatings are largely unknown. This knowledge would be valuable for both developers and users of cleaning technology.},

Mollusks are particularly sensitive to different environmental parameters, showing macroscale shell morphology variations in response to environmental parameters.

Here, we investigate shell features at the macro, micro and nanoscale, in populations of the commercially important clam Chamelea gallina along a latitudinal gradient ({\textasciitilde}400 km) of temperature and solar radiation in the Adriatic Sea (Italian cost). Six populations of clams with shells of the same length were analyzed. Shells from the warmest and the most irradiated population were thinner, with more oval shape, more porous and lighter, showing lower load fracture. However, no variation was observed in shell CaCO3 polymorphism (100\% aragonite) or in compositional and textural shell parameters, indicating no effect of the environmental parameters on the basic processes of biomineralization. Because of the importance of this species as commercial resource in the Adriatic Sea, the experimentally quantified and significant variations of mass and fracture load in C. gallina shells along the latitudinal gradient may have economic implications for fisheries producing different economical yield for fishermen and consumers along the Adriatic coastline.},

	abstract = {The environmental monitoring strategy termed ecosystem-based approach (EBA) underlines the obvious benefits of managing natural resources on a holistic level, and it is particularly invoked for the rational and sustainable management of aquatic resources. However, when coming to implement EBA into monitoring schemes, such as those derived from the implementation of the European legislation concerning water quality, difficulties inherent to the complex and dynamic nature of ecosystems arise, including (i) identify appropriate, relevant and easily measurable indicators of ecosystem integrity, and (ii) combine the heterogeneous information gathered at the different levels of organization included in an ecosystem into a simple and practical decision-making scheme. The first kind of difficulties maybe partially overcome by implementing monitoring schemes which take into account the hierarchical nature of ecosystem processes and did not neglect the use of indicators at low levels of biological organization, including ecotoxicological biomarkers and bioassays. Secondly, the integration of the monitoring results into a practical decision-making scheme can best be achieved by using non metric multivariate analysis, which is especially suitable for data bases including different metrics, and allows the processing of variables showing non-monotonic response to human stress, from molecular biomarkers to community indices. The difficulties inherent to the current rigid scheme of water quality assessment heavily based on ratio-to-reference univariate indicators and arbitrary reference values and class boundaries for each single indicator are illustrated with a case study in the Minho estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula). The classification of aquatic ecosystems into discrete categories of ecological status can best be achieved by combining observations at different levels of biological organization, from molecular biomarkers to community traits, with explicative physicochemical and hydromorphological elements, and by using non-metric multivariate analysis techniques.},

Subsampling from these 60 fish, Hg concentration was also determined in both somatic tissue and ovaries (n = 5), while methylmercury (MeHg) concentration was determined in whole fish (n = 18). Bioenergetics modeling was used to assess the growth dilution effect on the difference in Hg concentrations between the sexes. Mean whole-fish Hg concentration in females (59.9 ng/g) was not significantly different from mean whole-fish Hg concentration in males (54.4 ng/g). MeHg accounted for 91\% of the mercury found in the lake whitefish. Bioenergetics modeling results indicated that the growth dilution effect did not contribute to the difference in Hg concentrations between the sexes. We estimated that females increased in Hg concentration by 17.9\%, on average, immediately after spawning due to release of eggs. Using polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) data for the same 60 lake whitefish from a previous study, we detected a significant interaction between sex and contaminant type (Hg or PCBs), which was attributable to males being significantly higher in PCB concentration than females. Males may be eliminating Hg at a faster rate than females.},

	abstract = {Mercury (Hg) is still a focus of environmental research, since its levels in fish frequently exceed the Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) of 20 µg/kg for biota defined by the European Water Framework Directive (Directive 2008/105/EC). Current Hg levels in Abramis brama from German rivers are in the range of 73-346 µg/kg wet weight (2009) and exceed the EQS by a factor of 3.7-17.3. Therefore, it is important to identify the sources of Hg pollution in the aquatic environment and to develop effective strategies for reducing the input into associated river systems. The aim of the present study was to analyze Hg in the urban water cycle of the city of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Samples were taken from the river Main crosscutting the city and its tributaries. In addition, precipitation, stormwater runoff, effluents of two municipal WWTPs, and stormwater management structures such as combined sewer overflows and stormwater retention basins have been analyzed. Loads of Hg have been determined based on the measured concentrations and a Hg mass balance for the aquatic system was created. A total of 160 water samples were analyzed by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (CVAFS) according to US EPA Method 1631. Results from the mass balance have shown that approximately 5 kg Hg/a enter and 15 kg Hg/a leave the study area of Frankfurt am Main via the river Main. The largest amount of Hg (24.58 kg/a) throughout the urban water cycle of Frankfurt am Main is transported via wastewater. However, municipal WWTPs in Frankfurt am Main have been identified as the largest Hg sink, since 99.7\% (24.5 kg/a) of the Hg is shifted from the sewage water and stormwater during treatment into the sewage sludge. Thus, the increase of the Hg load in the river Main from 5 to 15 kg/a has to be attributed to other sources such as 3 industrial WWTPs, groundwater and non-treated stormwater runoff during heavy rain events.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00265-015-1947-4},
	abstract = {Two classes of explanations for covariation between activity level and metabolic rate among conspecifics have been proposed. First, individual-level variation in activity exhibited during the measurement of metabolic rate should covary with routine metabolic rate because movement increases respiration (a methodological relationship). Second, energetic-based hypotheses posit relationships between individual activity measured under more natural conditions and baseline measures of metabolic rate, among other behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits (functional relationships). Here, we examined these potential relationships between individual behavior and metabolic rate in the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii). Specifically, we tested for (1) an effect of crab activity in metabolic chambers (activity{\textasciicircum}sub chamber{\textasciicircum}) on routine metabolic rate (RMR), and (2) an effect of crab activity in mesocosms that mimicked field conditions (activity{\textasciicircum}sub mesocosm{\textasciicircum}) on standard metabolic rate (SMR). To test for context dependence, we assessed both activity-metabolic rate relationships in the absence and presence of predation threat from toadfish (Opsanus tau) in the form of waterborne chemical cues. Individual variation in activity{\textasciicircum}sub mesocosm{\textasciicircum} and RMR was repeatable over time. In support of a methodological relationship, individual differences in RMR were partially explained by crab activity{\textasciicircum}sub chamber{\textasciicircum}. After accounting for this methodological relationship, individual SMR was inversely related to activity{\textasciicircum}sub mesocosm{\textasciicircum}, supporting an allocation model that predicts behavior and baseline metabolic rate compete for finite energy reserves. We found no evidence of context dependence in either activity-metabolic rate relationship. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of considering methodological artifacts in elucidating functional relationships between individual behavior and energetics.},

Such biofilm formation, also known as fouling, is a complex multistage process and not yet thoroughly investigated. In this study, the succession of diatoms and bacteria was investigated during a one month exposure on an artificial substrate of plexiglass (polymer of methyl methacrylate) mounted above the seafloor at a depth of 5 m. For biofilm analyses, the fouling was investigated using selective agar plates, epifluorescence, light and electronic microscopy, as well as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment analysis. During biofilm development, the abundance of all biofilm components increased and reached maximum values after a one month exposure. In the bacterial community, heterotrophic marine bacteria were dominant and reached 1.96 ± 0.79 × 10[4] colony forming units (CFU) cm[-2]. Despite the fact that faecal coliforms and intestinal enterococci were detected in the water column, faecal coliforms were not detected in the biofilm and intestinal enterococci appeared after one month of exposure but in the negligible number of 60 ± 10 CFU cm[-2]. The phototrophic component of the biofilm was dominated by diatoms and reached a concentration of 6.10 × 10[5] cells cm[-2], which was supported by pigment analysis with fucoxanthin as dominant pigment in a concentration up to 110 ng cm[-2]. The diatom community was dominated by Cylindrotheca closterium and other pennate benthic diatoms. A detailed taxonomic analysis by electronic microscopy revealed 30 different taxa of diatoms. The study confirmed that a plexiglass surface in a marine environment is susceptible to biofouling within 30 days of contact. Furthermore, the co lonization process sequence firstly involved bacteria and cyanobacteria, and secondly diatoms, which together formed a primary biofilm in the sea.},

The St. Lawrence Seaway does not become salty enough until Quebec City, nearly 900 kilometres away from Hamilton.              There have been occasional discoveries of the crab in the Great Lakes over the years, but Monday's was the first report in Hamilton Harbour. [Hugh MacIsaac] says the creature probably found its way to the harbour in the ballast water of a ship.              The fishway has been operating since 1996, recording dozens of species, from common carp to brown bullheads. The harbour has seen some increases in desirable species of fish, most notably with yellow perch, but not nearly to the extent that scientists involved in harbour remediation had hoped.},

Over the last decade, intensive multidisciplinary research has focused on assessing the impacts of Montreal wastewater effluents on the SLR. We describe the major findings of these investigations, including the determination of the fate of contaminants, bioaccumulation in fish and invertebrates, ecotoxicological measurements of aquatic animal health, evaluation of endocrine disruption, parasitism in fish, and combined effects of multiple stressors on the SLR. Impacts of the effluents from the WWTP on aquatic organisms from the SLR are both toxicological and ecological, demonstrating the need for an integrated view of the impacts of municipal effluents on aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Evidence has been mounting for some time that intensive row-crop agriculture as practiced in developed countries may not be environmentally sustainable, with concerns increasingly being raised about climate change, implications for water quantity and quality, and soil degradation. This volume synthesizes two decades of research on the sustainability of temperate, row-crop ecosystems of the Midwestern United States. The overarching hypothesis guiding this work has been that more biologically based management practices could greatly reduce negative impacts while maintaining sufficient productivity to meet demands for food, fiber and fuel, but that roadblocks to their adoption persist because we lack a comprehensive understanding of their benefits and drawbacks.The research behind this book, based at the Kellogg Biological Station (Michigan State University) and conducted under the aegis of the Long-term Ecological Research network, is structured on a foundation of large-scale field experiments that explore alternatives to conventional, chemical-intensive agriculture. Studies have explored the biophysical underpinnings of crop productivity, the interactions of crop ecosystems with the hydrology and biodiversity of the broader landscapes in which they lie, farmers' views about alternative practices, economic valuation of ecosystem services, and global impacts such as greenhouse gas exchanges with the atmosphere. In contrast to most research projects, the long-term design of this research enables identification of slow or delayed processes of change in response to management regimes, and allows examination of responses across a broader range of climatic variability. This volume synthesizes this comprehensive inquiry into the ecology of alternative cropping systems, identifying future steps needed on the path to sustainability.},

However, the individual role of the several GST isoforms in the MC detoxification process is still unknown. In this study, the time-dependent changes on gene expression of several GST isoforms (pi, mu, sigma 1, sigma 2) in parallel with enzymatic activity of total GST were investigated in gills and hepatopancreas of the bivalve Ruditapes philippinarum exposed to pure MC-LR (10 and 100 µg/L). No significant changes in GST enzyme activities were found on both organs. In contrast, MC-LR affected the transcriptional activities of these detoxification enzymes both in gills and hepatopancreas. GST transcriptional changes in gills promoted by MC-LR were characterized by an early (12 h) induction of mu and sigma 1 transcripts. On the other hand, the GST transcriptional changes in hepatopancreas were characterized by a later induction (48 h) of mu transcript, but also by an early inhibition (6 h) of the four transcripts. The different transcription patterns obtained for the tested GST isoforms in this study highlight the potential divergent physiological roles played by these isoenzymes during the detoxification of MC-LR.},

Many different antifouling and antimicrobial materials have been developed to struggle against bacteria and other micro- and macro-organism attachment to different surfaces. However the "miracle solution" has still to be found. The research presented here concerns the synthesis of bio-based polymeric materials and the biological tests that showed their antifouling and, at the same time, antibacterial activity. The raw material used for the coating synthesis was natural rubber. The polyisoprene chains were fragmented to obtain oligomers, which had reactive chemical groups at their chain ends, therefore they could be modified to insert polymerizable and biocidal groups. Films were obtained by radical photopolymerization of the natural rubber derived oligomers and their structure was altered, in order to understand the mechanism of attachment inhibition and to increase the efficiency of the anti-biofouling action. The adhesion of three species of pathogenic bacteria and six strains of marine bacteria was studied. The coatings were able to inhibit bacterial attachment by contact, as it was verified that no detectable leaching of toxic molecules occurred.},

Several Ce-carbonate, -phosphate, -silicate, and -(hydr)oxide minerals have been historically mined and processed for pharmaceutical uses and industrial applications. Of all Ce minerals, cerium dioxide has received much attention in the global nanotechnology market due to their useful applications for catalysts, fuel cells, and fuel additives. A recent mass flow modeling study predicted that a major source of CeO{\textasciicircum}sub 2{\textasciicircum} nanoparticles from industrial processing plants (e.g., electronics and optics manufactures) is likely to reach the terrestrial environment such as landfills and soils. The environmental fate of CeO{\textasciicircum}sub 2{\textasciicircum} nanoparticles is highly dependent on its physcochemical properties in low temperature geochemical environment. Though there are needs in improving the analytical method in detecting/quantifying CeO{\textasciicircum}sub 2{\textasciicircum} nanoparticles in different environmental media, it is clear that aquatic and terrestrial organisms have been exposed to CeO{\textasciicircum}sub 2{\textasciicircum} NPs, potentially yielding in negative impact on human and ecosystem health. Interestingly, there has been contradicting reports about the toxicological effects of CeO{\textasciicircum}sub 2{\textasciicircum} nanoparticles, acting as either an antioxidant or reactive oxygen species production-inducing agent).

	abstract = {This study investigated the distribution of cadmium (Cd) and the protein level of metallothionein (MT) and examined the relationship of Cd accumulation and the MT concentration in different tissues of freshwater mussel Anodonta woodiana following Cd treatment. The mussels were exposed to Cd (4.21, 8.43, 16.86, 33.72 and 67.45 mg L-1) for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, respectively. After Cd treatment, the gills, mantle, foot, visceral mass and digestive gland tissues were collected for analysis. We found that, in the controls, Cd distributed in all tissues in the concentration order of gills{\textgreater}mantle{\textgreater}foot{\textgreater}visceral mass{\textgreater}digestive gland. Upon Cd treatment, Cd concentration significantly increased in all tissues. The highest Cd accumulation was found in the digestive gland, which was 0.142 mg g-1 (P{\textless}0.05). MT levels in the gills and mantle of the mussels increased significantly (P{\textless}0.05), which were in positive correlation with Cd accumulation in the tissues (P{\textless}0.05). In conclusion, our results demonstrated a correlation between Cd accumulation and MT up-regulation in gills and mantle of the mussels after Cd treatment. It is suggested that the protein level of MT in gills and mantle of Anodonta woodiana is a good biomarker for Cd contamination.},

	abstract = {Tailored to the needs of scientists developing drugs, chemicals, cosmetics and other products this one-stop reference for medicinal chemists covers all the latest developments in the field of predictive toxicology and its applications in safety assessment.

With a keen emphasis on novel approaches, the topics have been tackled by selected expert scientists, who are familiar with the theoretical scientific background as well as with the practical application of current methods. Emerging technologies in toxicity assessment are introduced and evaluated in terms of their predictive power, with separate sections on computer predictions and simulation methods, novel in vitro systems including those employing stem cells, toxicogenomics and novel biomarkers. In each case, the most promising methods are discussed and compared to classical in vitro and in vivo toxicology assays. Finally, an outlook section discusses such forward-looking topics as immunotoxicology assessment and novel regulatory requirements.

With its wealth of methodological knowledge and its critical evaluation of modern approaches, this is a valuable guide for toxicologists working in pharmaceutical development, as well as in safety assessment and the regulation of drugs and chemicals.

In aquatic environments PBDEs were found to be accumulated along food chain and Endocrine disruptors toxicity. In this study PBDEs were investigated in sediment and fish tissues from Lake Chaohu in central eastern China. There were 10 PBDEs congeners detected out of all 41 PBDEs. BDE-47 was of the highest with 5.17 ng/g in sediment and 58.47 ng/g in fish. PBDEs were evenly distributed across the surface sediment in the whole lake. It implied that the main source of PBDEs may not be an inflow river like Nanfei. Tissue distribution patterns of PBDEs in four fish species were in the order of BDE-47 {\textgreater} BDE-99 {\textgreater} BDE-100 {\textgreater} BDE-66 {\textgreater} BDE-138 {\textgreater} BDE-183 {\textgreater} BDE-154 {\textgreater} BDE-153. Octa- and deca-BDEs were below the detection limit. The concentrations of all PBDE congeners were higher in gills, livers, and kidneys than those in muscles and adipose tissue. Furthermore, PBDEs in different tissues had some different distribution patterns with fish size. Those discrepancies appeared to be correlated with the PBDEs pollution fluxes varying with the change of the year and their metabolism divergences in fish tissues.},

	abstract = {Guide to U.S. Environmental Policy provides the analytical connections showing readers how issues and actions are translated into public policies and persistent institutions for resolving or managing environmental conflict in the U.S. The guide highlights a complex decision-making cycle that requires the cooperation of government, business, and an informed citizenry to achieve a comprehensive approach to environmental protection. The book's topical, operational, and relational essays address development of U.S. environmental policies, the federal agencies and public and private organizations that frame and administer environmental policies, and the challenges of balancing conservation and preservation against economic development, the ongoing debates related to turning environmental concerns into environmental management, and the role of the U.S. in international organizations that facilitate global environmental governance.  

Key Features:

30 essays by leading conservationists and scholars in the field investigate the fundamental political, social, and economic processes and forces driving policy decisions about the protection and future of the environment.
Essential themes traced through the chapters include natural resource allocation and preservation, human health, rights of indigenous peoples, benefits of recycling, economic and other policy areas impacted by responses to green concerns, international cooperation, and immediate and long-term costs associated with environmental policy.
The essays explore the impact made by key environmental policymakers, presidents, and politicians, as well as the topical issues that have influenced U.S. environmental public policy from the colonial period to the present day.
A summary of regulatory agencies for environmental policy, a selected bibliography, and a thorough index are included.
This must-have reference for political science and public policy students who seek to understand the forces that U.S. environmental policy is suitable for academic, public, high school, government, and professional libraries.},

	abstract = {Influenza A virus (IAV) in wild bird reservoir hosts is characterized by the perpetuation in a plethora of subtype and genotype constellations. Multiyear monitoring studies carried out during the last two decades worldwide have provided a large body of knowledge regarding the ecology of IAV in wild birds. Nevertheless, other issues of avian IAV evolution have not been fully elucidated, such as the complexity and dynamics of genetic interactions between the co-circulating IAV genomes taking place at a local-scale level or the phenomenon of frozen evolution. We investigated the IAV diversity in a mallard population residing in a single pond in the Czech Republic. Despite the relative small number of samples collected, remarkable heterogeneity was revealed with four different IAV subtype combinations, H6N2, H6N9, H11N2, and H11N9, and six genomic constellations in co-circulation. Moreover, the H6, H11, and N2 segments belonged to two distinguishable sub-lineages. A reconstruction of the pattern of genetic reassortment revealed direct parent-progeny relationships between the H6N2, H11N9 and H6N9 viruses. Interestingly the IAV, with the H6N9 subtype, was re-detected a year later in a genetically unchanged form in the close proximity of the original sampling locality. The almost absolute nucleotide sequence identity of all the respective genomic segments between the two H6N9 viruses indicates frozen evolution as a result of prolonged conservation in the environment. The persistence of the H6N9 IAV in various abiotic and biotic environmental components was also discussed.},

Recently, environmental DNA (eDNA), the use of species-specific genetic assays to detect the DNA of a particular species in a water sample, has gained recognition as a tool for tracking the invasion front of these species toward the Great Lakes. The goal of this study was to develop new species-specific conventional PCR (cPCR) and quantitative (qPCR) markers for detection of these species in North American waterways. We first generated complete mitochondrial genome sequences from 33 bighead and 29 silver carp individuals collected throughout their introduced range. These sequences were aligned with other common and closely related species to identify potential eDNA markers. We then field-tested these genetic markers for species-specificity and sensitivity in environmental samples. Newly developed markers performed well in field trials, had low false positive rates and had comparable sensitivity compared to current markers. The new markers developed in this study greatly expand the number of species-specific genetic markers available to track the invasion front of bighead and silver carp, and can be used to improve the resolution of these assays. Additionally, the use of the qPCR markers developed in this study may reduce sample processing time and cost of eDNA monitoring for these species.},

	abstract = {The classic literature on predation dealt almost exclusively with solitary predators and their prey. Going back to Lotka-Volterra and optimal foraging theory, the theory about predation, including predator-prey population dynamics, was developed for solitary species. Various consequences of sociality for predators have been considered only recently. Similarly, while it was long recognized that prey species can benefit from living in groups, research on the adaptive value of sociality for prey species mostly emerged in the 1970s. The main theme of this book is the various ways that predators and prey may benefit from living in groups. The first part focusses on predators and explores how group membership influences predation success rate, from searching to subduing prey. The second part focusses on how prey in groups can detect and escape predators. The final section explores group size and composition and how individuals respond over evolutionary times to the challenges posed by chasing or being chased by animals in groups. This book will help the reader understand current issues in social predation theory and provide a synthesis of the literature across a broad range of animal taxa. 
Includes the whole taxonomical range rather than limiting it to a select fewFeatures in-depth analysis that allows a better understanding of many subtleties surrounding the issues related to social predationPresents both models and empirical results while covering the extensive predator and prey literatureContains extensive illustrations and separate boxes that cover more technical features, i.e., to present models and review results},

	abstract = {Wetlands are often seen as the ultimate symbol of beauty and tranquillity, their clear waters sheltering mysterious animals in a world where change is gentle and slow, from dragonflies skimming above their own reflections to the fishes glimpsed briefly below. Yet Australian wetlands are among the most varied and changeable habitats found anywhere, and the many creatures that live out their lives in and around water are superbly adapted to some of the most unpredictable ecosystems in the world.This book follows the diverse common themes and patterns that link inland waters from Tasmania to the tropics. It shows how cycles of change, the ways that different wetland animals travel through and between wetlands, and the interactions of the animals themselves create an ever-changing ecological kaleidoscope. Drawing on what is known of the biology, ecology and even the genetics of many of the most abundant, widespread and successful groups of animals, the author shows similarities to wetlands in other parts of the world, as well as some of the more extreme environments and specialised animals that are unique to this continent. Far more than a natural history, Living Waters explains the underlying forces that drive ecological change and movement in Australian wetlands, from the particular needs and habits of some specialised waterbirds to swarms of dragonflies and damselflies that may flourish for a few months before disappearing for years, and fishes found gasping in drying pools far from the nearest permanent water just hours after a desert deluge.},

	abstract = {Ecology of Australian Temperate Reefs presents the current state of knowledge of the ecology of important elements of southern Australian sub-tidal reef flora and fauna, and the underlying ecological principles. Preliminary chapters describe the geological origin, oceanography and biogeography of southern Australia, including the transitional temperate regions toward the Abrolhos Islands in the west and to Sydney in the east. The book then explains the origin and evolution of the flora and fauna at geological time scales as Australia separated from Antarctica; the oceanography of the region, including principal currents, and interactions with on-shelf waters; and the ecology of particular species or species groups at different trophic levels, starting with algae, then the ecological principles on which communities are organised. Finally, conservation and management issues are discussed.Ecology of Australian Temperate Reefs is well illustrated with line drawings, figures and colour photographs showing the many species covered, and will be a much valued reference for biologists, undergraduates, and those interested and concerned with reef life and its natural history.},

	abstract = {Doc number: 541              Abstract              Background: Production of carp dominates world aquaculture. More than 1.1 million tonnes of rohu carp, Labeo rohita  (Hamilton), were produced in 2010. Aeromonas hydrophila  is a bacterial pathogen causing aeromoniasis in rohu, and is a major problem for carp production worldwide. There is a need to better understand the genetic mechanisms affecting resistance to this disease, and to develop tools that can be used with selective breeding to improve resistance. Here we use a 6 K SNP array to genotype 21 full-sibling families of L. rohita  that were experimentally challenged intra-peritoneally with a virulent strain of A. hydrophila  to scan the genome for quantitative trait loci associated with disease resistance.              Results: In all, 3193 SNPs were found to be informative and were used to create a linkage map and to scan for QTL affecting resistance to A. hydrophila . The linkage map consisted of 25 linkage groups, corresponding to the number of haploid chromosomes in L. rohita . Male and female linkage maps were similar in terms of order, coverage (1384 and 1393 cM, respectively) and average interval distances (1.32 and 1.35 cM, respectively). Forty-one percent of the SNPs were annotated with gene identity using BLAST (cut off E-score of 0.001). Twenty-one SNPs mapping to ten linkage groups showed significant associations with the traits hours of survival  and dead or alive  (P  {\textless}0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Of the SNPs showing significant or suggestive associations with the traits, several were homologous to genes of known immune function or were in close linkage to such genes. Genes of interest included heat shock proteins (70, 60, 105 and "small heat shock proteins"), mucin (5b precursor and 2), lectin (receptor and CD22), tributyltin-binding protein, major histocompatibility loci (I and II), complement protein component c7-1, perforin 1, ubiquitin (ligase, factor e4b isoform 2 and conjugation enzyme e2 c), proteasome subunit, T-cell antigen receptor and lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine kinase.              Conclusions: A panel of markers has been identified that will be validated for use with both genomic and marker-assisted selection to improve resistance of L. rohita  to A. hydrophila .},

	abstract = {There is concern about the possible toxicity of palladium nanoparticles (Pd-NP), as they are released in the environment through many applications. We previously studied the toxicity of Pd-NP at high concentrations; here we address the possible toxicity of Pd-NP at low, subtoxic doses. In particular, we have exposed normal human PBMC entering into the first in vitro mitotic division to Pd-NP and to Pd(IV) ions to evaluate ROS generation and cell cycle progression. We have measured a statistically significant increase of intracellular ROS in Pd(IV) exposed cells, but not in Pd-NP exposed cells. TEM revealed accumulation of lipid droplets and autophagic and mitophagic vacuoles, which appeared more conspicuous in cells exposed to Pd(IV) ions than to Pd-NP. Pd-NP were visible in the cytoplasm of Pd-NP exposed cells. Pd-NP addition was associated with a significant increase of cells within the G0/G1-phase and a significant reduction in GS- and G2/M-phases. Cells exposed to Pd(IV) ions showed a significant amplification of these cell cycle alterations. These results suggest that ions, per se or released by NPs, are the true inducers of Pd toxicity. It will be essential to verify whether the observed disturbance represents a temporary response or might result in permanent alterations.},

They are the main threat, in terms of days of harvesting bans, to aquaculture in Northern Japan, Chile, and Europe. Toxicity and toxin profiles are very variable, more between strains than species. The distribution of DSP events mirrors that of shellfish production areas that have implemented toxin regulations, otherwise misinterpreted as bacterial or viral contamination. Field observations and laboratory experiments have shown that most of the toxins produced by Dinophysis are released into the medium, raising questions about the ecological role of extracelular toxins and their potential uptake by shellfish. Shellfish contamination results from a complex balance between food selection, adsorption, species-specific enzymatic transformations, and allometric processes. Highest risk areas are those combining Dinophysis strains with high cell content of okadaates, aquaculture with predominance of mytilids (good accumulators of toxins), and consumers who frequently include mussels in their diet. Regions including pectenotoxins in their regulated phycotoxins will suffer from much longer harvesting bans and from disloyal competition with production areas where these toxins have been deregulated.},

Animals were exposed to monocrotophos (52.36 mg/l) for four days. Malondialdehyde (MDA) values were measured as index of oxidation while Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione s-Transferase (GST), and Glutathione-Reductase (GR) were measured as index of an antioxidant status. After exposure, a significant reduction of the capability to neutralize radicals was observed. Histopathological changes, such as fibrosis in gill filaments and hypertrophy in mucous cells of foot tissue, were observed after treatment.In a second series of experiment, exposed animals were thereafter transferred to clean water and kept in it up to 28 days to assess the recovery pattern. Significant recovery is observed in AchE and antioxidant enzymes. Oxidative damage observed after acute exposure indicate that mussels faced an oxidative challenge but were able to counteract, as values of anti-oxidants returned near to control values after 28 days. Altered activities in anti-oxidant enzymes due to stress recovered well after 28 days in gill and muscles as compared to foot and mantle. Overall results suggested that oxidative markers are highly sensitive and could be profitably applied to freshwater mussels for environmental quality assessment in freshwater.},

	abstract = {La biosurveillance des écosystèmes doit reposer non seulement sur le suivi des populations (structure et dynamique) mais aussi sur la connaissance de leurs niveaux de contamination. Cependant, la prise en compte de la bioaccumulation des contaminants dans les organismes se heurte à la complexité des processus biologiques impliqués, variables selon les espèces, les milieux et les substances chimiques considérés ce qui explique le faible nombre de modèles de transfert disponibles. Par ailleurs, la difficulté technique d'analyser les contaminants persistants et bioaccumulatifs dans les tissus limite également l'intégration de la bioaccumulation dans les programmes de biosurveillance alors même que cette mesure permettrait de caractériser leur devenir, leur biodisponibilité et parfois d'expliquer leurs effets toxiques.
Cet ouvrage est une revue des données sur la bioaccumulation des contaminants de l'environnement chez les invertébrés (nématodes, annélides, mollusques, arthropodes) et chez les vertébrés (reptiles, oiseaux, mammifères). L'intérêt de ces données pour l'évaluation du risque écologique, de même que divers modèles d'étude des transferts dans les chaînes trophiques et les relations entre bioaccumulation et effets toxiques sont présentés. Des recommandations pour une meilleure prise en compte de l'analyse de la bioaccumulation en évaluation des risques sont proposées.
Ce livre s'adresse aux personnes et organisations publiques ou privées impliquées dans la surveillance des milieux naturels, dans l'évaluation des risques environnementaux des substances chimiques. Il s'adresse également aux chercheurs, enseignants, et étudiants des filières s'intéressant aux problèmes de l'environnement impliquant des contaminations chimiques. Fruit du travail d'enseignants-chercheurs en écotoxicologie de l'université de Franche-Comté (A. de Vaufleury, F. Gimbert), cet ouvrage a été réalisé avec l'appui d'un zoologiste (L.

	abstract = {The tools of environmental economics guide policymakers as they weigh development against nature, present against future, and certain benefits against uncertain consequences. From reluctant-but-necessary calculations of the value of life, to quandaries over profits at the environment's expense, the policies and research findings explained in this textbook are relevant to decisions made daily by individuals, firms, and governments. The fourth edition of Environmental Economics and Natural Resource Management pairs the user-friendly approaches of the previous editions with the latest developments in the field. A story-based narrative delivers clear, concise coverage of contemporary policy initiatives. To promote environmental and economic literacy, we have added even more visual aids, including color photographs and diagrams unmatched in other texts. Ancillaries include an Instructor's Guide with answers to all of the practice problems and downloadable slides of figures and tables from the book. The economy is a subset of the environment, from which resources are obtained, workers and consumers receive sustenance, and life begins. Energy prices and environmental calamities constrain economic growth and the quality of life. The same can be said about overly restrictive environmental policies. It is with an appreciation for the weighty influence of this discipline, and the importance of conveying it to students, that this textbook is crafted.},

	abstract = {A fascinating examination of the benefits and downsides of large dams, this book explores the political, economic and environmental impact and importance of water management policy practised across the world.Dr Mark Everard's work in all four sectors of society - private, public, academic and voluntary - has taken him across five continents to undertake applied research, policy development and capacity-building relating to the ways in which people connect with ecosystems. The author of twelve other books, including Common Ground (Zed Books, 2011), over sixty peer-reviewed scientific papers and over two hundred technical magazine articles, Mark is also a communicator on sustainability and wider aquatic matters on TV and radio. He has served on numerous government advisory and expert groups in the UK, as well as advising other governments and multinational corporations on sustainability matters. His specialty is on the water environment, land uses across the catchments that influence it, the pressures that people impose upon it and the many often unrecognised benefits that they derive from it. Mark's work includes environmental ethics and economics as a means to bring our intimate interdependencies with ecosystems into the mainstream of public awareness and government thinking.},

This volume provides an introduction to the techniques and literature of molecular genetics; defines terminology; and reviews concepts, principles, and applications of these powerful tools. The world of insect molecular genetics, once dominated by "Drosophila," has become much more diverse, especially with the sequencing of multiple arthropod genomes (from spider mites to mosquitoes). This introduction includes discussion of honey bees, mosquitoes, flour beetles, silk moths, fruit flies, aphids, house flies, kissing bugs, cicadas, butterflies, tsetse flies and armyworms. 
This book serves as both a foundational text and a review of a rapidly growing literature. With fully revised and updated chapters, the third edition will be a valuable addition to the personal libraries of entomologists, geneticists, and molecular biologists.
* Up-to-date references to important review articles, websites, and seminal citations in the disciplines
* Well crafted and instructive illustrations integral to explaining the techniques of molecular genetics
* Glossary of terms to help beginners learn the vocabulary of molecular biology"},

	abstract = {Algae are some of the fastest growing organisms in the world, with up to 90\% of their weight made up from carbohydrate, protein and oil. As well as these macromolecules, microalgae are also rich in other high-value compounds, such as vitamins, pigments, and biologically active compounds, All these compounds can be extracted for use by the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and food industries, and the algae itself can be used for feeding of livestock, in particular fish, where on-going research is dedicated to increasing the percentage of fish and shellfish feed not derived from fish meal. Microalgae are also applied to wastewater bioremediation and carbon capture from industrial flue gases, and can be used as organic fertilizer.  
So far, only a few species of microalgae, including cyanobacteria, are under mass cultivation. The potential for expansion is enormous, considering the existing hundreds of thousands of species and subspecies, in which a large gene-pool offers a significant potential for many new producers.
Completely revised, updated and expanded, and with the inclusion of new Editor, Qiang Hu of Arizona State University, the second edition of this extremely important book contains 37 chapters. Nineteen of these chapters are written by new authors, introducing many advanced and emerging technologies and applications such as novel photobioreactors, mass cultivation of oil-bearing microalgae for biofuels, exploration of naturally occurring and genetically engineered microalgae as cell factories for high-value chemicals, and techno-economic analysis of microalgal mass culture. This excellent new edition also contains details of the biology and large-scale culture of several economically important and newly-exploited microalgae, including
Botryococcus,
Chlamydomonas, Nannochloropsis,
Nostoc,
Chlorella, Spirulina,
Haematococcus, and
Dunaniella species/strains.
Edited by Amos Richmond and Qiang Hu, each with a huge wealth of experience in microalgae, its culture, and biotechnology, and drawing together contributions from experts around the globe, this thorough and comprehensive new edition is an essential purchase for all those involved with microalgae, their culture, processing and use. Biotechnologists, bioengineers, phycologists, pharmaceutical, biofuel and fish-feed industry personnel and biological scientists and students will all find a vast amount of cutting-edge information within this Second Edition.

Samples were collected in two locations at each of 18 lakes. The first site was right at the outflow; the second site was 0.2 km downstream from the outflow. At downstream sites the percentage contribution of Rotifera in zooplankton species number and abundance was higher than in the outflow, whilst the percentage contribution of Cladocera and Copepoda (except nauplii) in the zooplankton species number and abundance was lower at downstream sites than in outlets. The most important variables affecting the rate of zooplankton reduction in the lake outlets are the biomass of cyprinids and hydrological parameters along the outlet, such as discharge, current velocity, and depth.              The most dramatic reductions involved daphnids, adult copepods, small cladocerans, and copepodites, while the reduction in the abundance of rotifers and nauplii was statistically insignificant.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (2-C-4-NA) is used as an intermediate in the manufacture of dyes, pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitor and also used in the synthesis of niclosamide, a molluscicide. It is marked as a black-listed substance due to its poor biodegradability. We report biodegradation of 2-C-4-NA and its pathway characterization by Rhodococcus sp. strain MB-P1 under aerobic conditions. The strain MB-P1 utilizes 2-C-4-NA as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. In the growth medium, the degradation of 2-C-4-NA occurs with the release of nitrite ions, chloride ions, and ammonia. During the resting cell studies, the 2-C-4-NA-induced cells of strain MB-P1 transformed 2-C-4-NA stoichiometrically to 4-amino-3-chlorophenol (4-A-3-CP), which subsequently gets transformed to 6-chlorohydroxyquinol (6-CHQ) metabolite. Enzyme assays by cell-free lysates prepared from 2-C-4-NA-induced MB-P1 cells, demonstrated that the first enzyme in the 2-C-4-NA degradation pathway is a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes the stoichiometric removal of nitro group and production of 4-A-3-CP. Oxygen uptake studies on 4-A-3-CP and related anilines by 2-C-4-NA-induced MB-P1 cells demonstrated the involvement of aniline dioxygenase in the second step of 2-C-4-NA degradation. This is the first report showing 2-C-4-NA degradation and elucidation of corresponding metabolic pathway by an aerobic bacterium.},

	abstract = {Today, the volume of data and knowledge of processes necessitates more complex models that integrate all available information. This handicap has been solved thanks to the technological advances in both software and hardware. Computational tools available today have allowed developing a new family of models, known as computational models. The description of these models is difficult as they can not be expressed analytically, and it is therefore necessary to create protocols that serve as guidelines for future users. The Population Dynamics P systems models (PDP) are a novel and effective computational tool to model complex problems, are characterized by the ability to work in parallel (simultaneously interrelating different processes), are modular and have a high computational efficiency. However, the difficulty of describing these models therefore requires a protocol to unify the presentation and the steps to follow. We use two case studies to demonstrate the use and implementation of these computational models for population dynamics and ecological process studies, discussing briefly their potential applicability to simulate complex ecosystem dynamics.},

	abstract = {Enables researchers to assess the effects of endocrine disrupters as well as comply with new environmental regulations 
Endocrine disrupters are chemicals--both man-made and natural--that interfere with the body's endocrine system, potentially resulting in adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effects. In recent years, a number of regulatory authorities around the world have drafted or enacted legislation that requires the detection and assessment of the effects of endocrine disrupters on both humans and wildlife. In response, this book provides comprehensive, up-to-date information on the latest tested and proven methods used to detect and assess the environmental hazards posed by endocrine-disrupting chemicals.

Endocrine Disrupters is divided into chapters covering each major taxon as well as chapters dedicated to hazard assessment and regulation. The book covers testing methods for all the vertebrate groups and several invertebrate phyla, including:

Crustaceans and mollusks
Insects
Fish
Amphibians and reptiles
Birds and mammals
Moreover, the book emphasizes practical, ethical testing methods that combine sensitivity, efficiency, statistical power, and reasonable cost.
Each chapter is written by one or more international experts in ecotoxicology, offering readers step-by-step guidance for implementing each method based on the latest research and the authors' firsthand laboratory experience. Furthermore, all the chapters have been subjected to a rigorous peer review and edited in light of the reviewers' comments. References at the end of each chapter guide readers to the literature in the field.

Endocrine Disrupters is recommended for scientists who need to test chemicals for possible endocrine-disrupting properties. It is also recommended for regulatory authorities who need to decide whether particular chemicals can be safely marketed.

The first site was right at the outflow; the second site was 0.2 km downstream from the outflow. At downstream sites the percentage contribution of Rotifera in zooplankton species number and abundance was higher than in the outflow, whilst the percentage contribution of Cladocera and Copepoda (except nauplii) in the zooplankton species number and abundance was lower at downstream sites than in outlets. The most important variables affecting the rate of zooplankton reduction in the lake outlets are the biomass of cyprinids and hydrological parameters along the outlet, such as discharge, current velocity, and depth.The most dramatic reductions involved daphnids, adult copepods, small cladocerans, and copepodites, while the reduction in the abundance of rotifers and nauplii was statistically insignificant.},

	abstract = {FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS IN AQUACULTURE 
Genomics has revolutionized biological research over the course of the last two decades. Genome maps of key agricultural species have offered increased understanding of the structure, organization, and evolution of animal genomes. Building upon this foundation, researchers are now emphasizing research on genome function.
Functional Genomics in Aquaculture looks at the advances in this field as they directly relate to key traits and species in aquaculture production.

Functional Genomics in Aquaculture opens with two chapters that provide a useful general introduction to the field of functional genomics. The second section of the book focuses on key production traits such as growth, development, reproduction, nutrition, and physiological response to stress and diseases. The final five chapters focus on a variety of key aquaculture species. Examples looking at our understanding of the functional genomes of salmonids, Mediterranean sea bass, Atlantic cod, catfish, shrimp, and molluscs, are included in the book.
Providing valuable insights and discoveries into the functional genomes of finfish and shellfish species,
Functional Genomics in Aquaculture will be an invaluable resource to researchers and professionals in aquaculture, genetics, and animal science.

	abstract = {The northern pike--sometimes affectionately known as the "aquatic wolf"--is one of the most sought after and mythologized fishes in Minnesota, but until now there have been few books devoted to the history and ecological management of the species. Based on pioneering research carried out in Minnesota by leading pike specialist Rodney B. Pierce, Northern Pike Ecology, Conservation, and Management History is the most complete collection of information to date on the species, for everyone from scientists and conservation biologists to general readers and recreational anglers. A tremendously important game fish and resource both in Minnesota and throughout the northern hemisphere, northern pike populations directly reflect local geology and human influence, playing a key role in the health of freshwater ecosystems. As urbanization spreads and the human population continues to grow, pike populations face increasing pressure, requiring new ways of looking at and managing the species. In Minnesota, groundbreaking work has been conducted on northern pike: analyses of stocking success and investigations into the relationships within fish communities, the management of rearing marshes, environmental effects on natural production, the genetics of northern pike, and strategies for scientifically monitoring pike. The state has been a leader in developing fishing regulations to help restore large pike, among many other measures designed to ensure the future quantity and health of a key species in Minnesota's waterways. Weaving significant historical scientific literature and technical details together with his own research, Pierce's benchmark study documents and synthesizes the long history of northern pike management and describes the latest efforts being taken to better understand and manage this critical and renowned species.},

	abstract = {Since its first publication more than twenty-five years ago, How to Build a Habitable Planet has established a legendary reputation as an accessible yet scientifically impeccable introduction to the origin and evolution of Earth, from the Big Bang through the rise of human civilization. This classic account of how our habitable planet was assembled from the stuff of stars introduced readers to planetary, Earth, and climate science by way of a fascinating narrative. Now this great book has been made even better. Harvard geochemist Charles Langmuir has worked closely with the original author, Wally Broecker, one of the world's leading Earth scientists, to revise and expand the book for a new generation of readers for whom active planetary stewardship is becoming imperative. Interweaving physics, astronomy, chemistry, geology, and biology, this sweeping account tells Earth's complete story, from the synthesis of chemical elements in stars, to the formation of the Solar System, to the evolution of a habitable climate on Earth, to the origin of life and humankind. The book also addresses the search for other habitable worlds in the Milky Way and contemplates whether Earth will remain habitable as our influence on global climate grows. It concludes by considering the ways in which humankind can sustain Earth's habitability and perhaps even participate in further planetary evolution. Like no other book, How to Build a Habitable Planet provides an understanding of Earth in its broadest context, as well as a greater appreciation of its possibly rare ability to sustain life over geologic time.

A final chapter provides extremely useful details of the most widely-used and trusted laboratory methods in the area. Much new information is included in this new edition, including enhanced coverage of any diseases which have become commercially significant since the publication of the previous edition.

The need to protect the planet seems frequently to be in conflict with the need to feed the earths inhabitants and to supply the energy required for industry, transportation, regulating our indoor environment, and fueling other needs. The corporate world sometimes seems to have a callous disregard for the safety of its workers and the public at large. This e-book discusses the ecological and health impacts of aquaculture, the Alberta tar sands development, the Gulf Oil disaster of 2010, the hazards of inadequately safeguarding water supplies, and global warming, to name some of the important topics. This e-book will be very useful to students of environmental science, ecology, ecotoxicology and others interested in a broad overview of contemporary environmental issues. It is presented in a highly readable manner that makes it accessible to well-informed members of the public. Complex biochemical and chemical equations are avoided.

People reflexively see all change as implying inevitably increasing progress and complexity. This expected directionality is especially observed in students' views of living things, with some species envisioned as "higher" or more evolved. Students tend naturally to see all evolutionary change as adaptive, progressive, optimal, and teleological, with improvement achieved as needed or desired by organisms (if not as planned in advance). Following an extended outline of many interrelated ways, this basic yet unfortunately widespread and deep-seated misconception of evolutionary thinking ensnares students and hinders proper understanding of the actual pattern and process of evolution, a more useful pedagogical approach is presented. A strategy that involves eliciting preconceptions, engaging in numerous counterexamples, and continually reinforcing an alternative view is generally effective. This is best achieved by tackling the misconception of progress head-on, with an active learning model that forces students to come up with substitute explanations. Several examples of exercises and activities to combat the universal and automatically intuitive inclination toward teleological notions of progress are given, including analyses of paleontology, ecology, biochemistry, development, and systematics.},

The wellness of a community is dependent upon the security of food, water, environment and energy. Such a security is best realised through science-illuminated (earth, space, hydrological, pedological, information) management of local resources (waters, soils, bioresources, minerals, rocks, sediments, etc.) in an ecologically-sustainable and people-participatory manner, plus value-addition through processing of natural products. Moreover, the addition of value may increase a community's wealth by advanced technologies, trading, exchange of knowledge, etc. Moreover, activities, employment and many other things come along with the availability of natural resources, which will require and affect policy.This volume provides guidelines for the implementation of technological, economical and policy advances in dealing with various aspects of natural resources. It is intended for researchers, professionals and students in environmental and earth sciences, mining, geography, sociology, economics and for policy makers and investors searching for potential in the natural resources industry.

To better understand the possible toxic effects of these toxins, Crassostrea gigas hemocytes were exposed to brevetoxin (PbTx-2). Hemocyte viability, monitored through the neutral red retention and MTT reduction assays, and apoptosis (Hoechst staining) remained unchanged during 12 h of exposure to PbTx-2 in concentrations up to 1000 µg/L. Despite cell viability and apoptosis remained stable, hemocytes incubated for 4 h with 1000 µg/L of PbTx-2 revealed higher expression levels of Hsp70 (p {\textless} 0.01) and CYP356A1 ( p {\textless} 0.05) transcripts and a tendency to increase FABP expression, as evaluated by Real-Time quantitative PCR. The expression of other studied genes (BPI, IL-17, GSTO, EcSOD, Prx6, SOD and GPx) remained unchanged. The results suggest that the absence of cytotoxic effects of PbTx-2 in Crassostrea gigas hemocytes, even at high concentrations, allow early defense responses to be produced by activating protective mechanisms associated to detoxification (CYP356A1 and possibly FABP) and stress (Hsp70), but not to immune or to antioxidant (BPI, IL-17, EcSOD, Prx6, GPx and SOD) related genes.},

	abstract = {Modern aquaculture is faced with a number of challenges, including public concern about environmental impacts and the welfare of farmed fish. A fundamental understanding of fish biology is central to finding ways to meet these challenges and is also essential for maintaining the industry's sustainability. 

Aquaculture \& Behavior provides such fundamental understanding with reference to behavioral biology, describing how to avoid problems caused by the natural behavior of farmed fish and providing information that, when properly applied, results in significant benefits for both the fish and the farmer.
Written and edited by an authoritative team,
Aquaculture \& Behavior provides a clear and concise account of aspects of fish biology that are central to aquaculture, gives expert guidance on the behavioral biology of farmed fish and explains how this can be, and is, applied to improve aquaculture practice. Special consideration is given to the role of behavior, why biologists are interested in behavior, and how they study and explain it. The authors focus on the techniques that have been developed for investigating the behavior of fish on farms and the behavior that we require of fish that are cultured for food, for science, for the ornamental trade and for release. The book also discusses and explores the issue of fish welfare and how it can be defined, identified and measured and features strategies for improving the welfare of farmed fish.
Informative and engaging,
Aquaculture \& Behavior brings the reader up-to-date with major issues pertaining to aquaculture. Everyone from fish farmers to upper level students will find this book a valuable and practical resource. Libraries in universities and research establishments where animal behavior, aquaculture, veterinary and biological sciences are studied and taught should have copies of this work on their shelves.Modern aquaculture is faced with a number of challenges, including public concern about environmental impacts and the welfare of farmed fish.

Once considered one of the most poorly understood and difficult sharks to study, this timely book recognizes a new sophisticated focus on the White Shark, raising its status from obscurity to enlightenment. The Global Perspectives on the Biology and Life History of the White Shark celebrates the White Shark as the most studied shark in the sea. Within the chapters one can find new insights into a vast range of topics, such as behavior, physiology, migration patterns, habitat preferences, daily activity patterns, molecular genetics, reproductive biology and new research methods. The book also delves into population monitoring and policy options for managers and researchers.},

	doi = {10.3390/ijms13021541},
	abstract = {Biocides are chemical substances that can deter or kill the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry is having a significant impact on the marine ecosystems. As the industry expands, it requires the use of more drugs, disinfectants and antifoulant compounds (biocides) to eliminate the microorganisms in the aquaculture facilities. The use of biocides in the aquatic environment, however, has proved to be harmful as it has toxic effects on the marine environment. Organic booster biocides were recently introduced as alternatives to the organotin compounds found in antifouling products after restrictions were imposed on the use of tributyltin (TBT). The replacement products are generally based on copper metal oxides and organic biocides. The biocides that are most commonly used in antifouling paints include chlorothalonil, dichlofluanid, DCOIT (4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, Sea-nine 211®), Diuron, Irgarol 1051, TCMS pyridine (2,3,3,6-tetrachloro-4-methylsulfonyl pyridine), zinc pyrithione and Zineb. There are two types of risks associated with the use of biocides in aquaculture: (i) predators and humans may ingest the fish and shellfish that have accumulated in these contaminants and (ii) the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. This paper provides an overview of the effects of antifouling (AF) biocides on aquatic organisms. It also provides some insights into the effects and risks of these compounds on non-target organisms.},

A morphometric exhaustive study was conducted on Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, by acquiring data in the French Arcachon Bay (intrasite phenotypic variability) and by comparing with other sites in the literature (intersite phenotypic variability). 2070 shells were subsampled, weighted, and automatically measured using TNPC software. Some ratios' values indicate a relatively round and globular shape shell in comparison with other sites confirming poor conditions for some individuals. Among adult clams, three main morphological groups were identified and discussed according to spatial considerations. Allometric relations for pairs of shell descriptors were determined by testing classical linear and piecewise regression models on log-transformed relation of Huxley. A significant shape change correlated to size was observed; it corresponds to the second year of life of the clam. Relationships between density, disease, and shell shape are demonstrated and discussed related to other potential factors affecting shell shape. Finally, consequences on population regulation are addressed.},

	abstract = {Limnology provides an in-depth and current overview of the field of limnology. The result of a major tour de force by two renowned and experienced experts, this unique and richly illustrated reference presents a wealth of data on limnology history, water as a substrate, lakes' origins and aquatic biota. Besides a general part, it gives special focus to neotropical limnology, prevalently applicable in countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Starting with the essentials, some definitions and a historical account, this volume then details the main interaction mechanisms with physical and chemical factors, diversity and geographical distribution. With regard to the major continental aquatic systems, it treats the dynamics, variability and characterization of lakes, reservoirs, flooded areas, saline lakes, estuaries and coastal lagoons. The impact of human activity on water resources and the need for the rehabilitation of watersheds, watershed ecosystems and estuaries are addressed subsequently. To illustrate theory, the final part includes research examples in limnology, ecology and environmental sciences in different geographical contexts, as well as ideas for new investigations. This reference volume is intended for researchers and professionals working on inland waters, lakes and rivers within the fields of biology, ecology, environment, forestry, geochemistry, geophysics, and water management. It will also benefit students in the aforementioned areas and readers involved with limnology in related disciplines, such as earth sciences, environmental, water and geological engineering.},

	abstract = {The third edition of The Ciliated Protozoa continues the innovative approach of the previous two editions, thoroughly documenting the progress in our understanding of the evolutionary diversification of these widely distributed eukaryotic microorganisms. 
The Glossary is considerably revised and expanded, serving as an illustrated 'subject index' of more than 700 terms. An introduction to the phylum is followed by chapters on the 11 classes. Each class chapter contains 7 sections:

taxonomic structure
life history and ecology
somatic structures
oral structures
division and morphogenesis
nuclei, sexuality, and life cycle
other features
The book includes new data on the ultrastructure of the somatic cortex of each class, molecular phylogenetics, ecology, and on other important aspects of ciliate biology. These new data are used, along with a novel conceptual approach, to rationalize a new system of classification for the phylum, presented in a major chapter on The Ciliate Taxa. The book includes an up-to-date bibliography of approximately 3,000 citations to both the 'classical' and recent literature, and both a Subject Index and a Systematic Index.
This unique and timely book will serve as a comprehensive and authoritative reference work for students, teachers, and researchers who have an interest in the protozoa, and particularly the ciliates.
As an additional feature, all figures are available electronically for free viewing on the book's homepage at www.springer.com/978-1-4020-8238-2, under Additional Information.
Completely revised and updated Major chapter on The Ciliate Taxa Glossary with more than 700 terms Contains hundreds of illustrations Contains both Subject and Systematic indices Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras
Dr. Denis H. Lynn received his graduate training at the University of Toronto where he received his Ph.D. Protozoology in 1975. His early research on the comparative ultrastructure of ciliates was published in Biological Reviews and lead to a revised classification of the Phylum Ciliophora, which was published in 1981 in collaboration with Eugene B. Small. Dr. Lynn has published extensively on ciliates, authoring more than a dozen book chapters and almost 120 refereed publications. He is currently a full professor in the Department of Integrative Biology, University of Guelph, and Editor in Chief of The Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology.},

	abstract = {Droughts are a major hazard to both natural and human-dominated environments and those, especially of long duration and high intensity, can be highly damaging and leave long-lasting effects. This book describes the climatic conditions that give rise to droughts, and their various forms and chief attributes. Past droughts are described including those that had severe impacts on human societies. As a disturbance, droughts can be thought of as "ramps" in that they usually build slowly and take time to become evident. As precipitation is reduced, flows from catchments into aquatic systems decline. As water declines in water bodies, ecological processes are changed and the biota can be drastically reduced, though species and populations may survive by using refuges.  Recovery from drought varies in both rates and in degrees of completeness and may be a function of both refuge availability and connectivity. 
For the first time, this book reviews the available rather scattered literature on the impacts of drought on the flora, fauna and ecological processes of aquatic ecosystems ranging from small ponds to lakes and from streams to estuaries.  The effects of drought on the biota of standing waters and flowing waters and of temporary waters and perennial systems are described and compared. In addition, the ways in which human activity can exacerbate droughts are outlined. In many parts of the world especially in the mid latitudes, global warming may result in increases in the duration and intensity of droughts.

From neotectonic point of view, the investigated area represents a natural border between two different morphostructural domains: the Pannonian Basin to the north and the Peri-Pannonian Realm to the south. More than 20 mollusc and 34 ostracod species were identified which indicate the upper part of the Lower Pannonian and the lower part of the Middle Pannonian ("Serbian") predominantly. The identified dinoflagellate cyst assemblage (21 taxa) hinders assignment of the studied samples to a Pannonian substage but supports the high endemism of the Pannonian flora. The lithostratigraphical, paleontological, and paleoecological analyses indicate a mesohaline (8-16 [per thousand]), sublittoral ({\textless}90 m deep) environment of the early Lake Pannon. The estimated stratigraphic range for the investigated deposits is 9.8-11.4 Ma.},

a
To get the application of ecology to policy or other practical concerns right, humanity needs a clear and disinterested philosophical understanding of ecology which can help identify the practical lessons of science. Conversely, the urgent practical demands humanity faces today cannot help but direct scientific and philosophical investigation toward the basis of those ecological challenges that threaten human survival. This book will help to fuel the timely renaissance of interest in philosophy of ecology that is now occurring in the philosophical profession.

	doi = {10.1186/1741-7007-9-4},
	abstract = {Abstract              Background: The degree of metal binding specificity in metalloproteins such as metallothioneins (MTs) can be crucial for their functional accuracy. Unlike most other animal species, pulmonate molluscs possess homometallic MT isoforms loaded with Cu+  or Cd2+ . They have, so far, been obtained as native metal-MT complexes from snail tissues, where they are involved in the metabolism of the metal ion species bound to the respective isoform. However, it has not as yet been discerned if their specific metal occupation is the result of a rigid control of metal availability, or isoform expression programming in the hosting tissues or of structural differences of the respective peptides determining the coordinative options for the different metal ions. In this study, the Roman snail (Helix pomatia ) Cu-loaded and Cd-loaded isoforms (HpCuMT and HpCdMT) were used as model molecules in order to elucidate the biochemical and evolutionary mechanisms permitting pulmonate MTs to achieve specificity for their cognate metal ion.              Results: HpCuMT and HpCdMT were recombinantly synthesized in the presence of Cd2+ , Zn2+  or Cu2+  and corresponding metal complexes analysed by electrospray mass spectrometry and circular dichroism (CD) and ultra violet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry. Both MT isoforms were only able to form unique, homometallic and stable complexes (Cd6 -HpCdMT and Cu12 -HpCuMT) with their cognate metal ions. Yeast complementation assays demonstrated that the two isoforms assumed metal-specific functions, in agreement with their binding preferences, in heterologous eukaryotic environments. In the snail organism, the functional metal specificity of HpCdMT and HpCuMT was contributed by metal-specific transcription programming and cell-specific expression. Sequence elucidation and phylogenetic analysis of MT isoforms from a number of snail species revealed that they possess an unspecific and two metal-specific MT isoforms, whose metal specificity was achieved exclusively by evolutionary modulation of non-cysteine amino acid positions.              Conclusion: The Roman snail HpCdMT and HpCuMT isoforms can thus be regarded as prototypes of isoform families that evolved genuine metal-specificity within pulmonate molluscs. Diversification into these isoforms may have been initiated by gene duplication, followed by speciation and selection towards opposite needs for protecting copper-dominated metabolic pathways from nonessential cadmium. The mechanisms enabling these proteins to be metal-specific could also be relevant for other metalloproteins.},

evaluation of hypoxia models for the northern Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay using

systems we find that model sensitivity and precision can be optimized and model
accuracy maintained within reasonable bounds by calibrating the model to relatively
short, recent 3year datasets. Model accuracy was higher for Chesapeake Bay
than for the Gulf of Mexico, potentially indicating the greater importance of
unmodeled processes in the latter system. Retrospective analyses demonstrate
both directional and variable changes in sensitivity of hypoxia to nutrient loads.},

	abstract = {As the first book to explore the confluence of three emerging yet critical fields of study, this work sets an exacting standard. The editors' aim was to produce the most authoritative guide for ecojustice, place-based education, and indigenous knowledge in education. Aimed at a wide audience that includes, but is not restricted to, science educators and policymakers, Cultural Studies and Environmentalism starts from the premise that schooling is a small part of the larger educational domain in which we live and learn. Informed by this overarching notion, the book opens up ways in which home-grown talents, narratives, and knowledge can be developed, and eco-region awareness and global relationships can be facilitated. Incorporating a diversity of perspectives that include photography, poetry and visual art, the work provides a nuanced lens for evaluating educational problems and community conditions while protecting and conserving the most threatened and vulnerable narratives. Editors and contributors share the view that the impending loss of these narratives should be discussed much more widely than is currently the case, and that both teachers and children can take on some of the responsibility for their preservation.The relevance of ecojustice to this process is clear. Ecojustice philosophy is a way of learning about how we frame, or perceive, the world around us--and why that matters. Although it is not synonymous with social or environmental justice, the priorities of ecojustice span the globe in the same way. It incorporates a deep recognition of the appropriateness and significance of learning from place-based experiences and indigenous knowledge systems rather than depending on some urgent "ecological crises" to advocate for school and societal change. With a multiplicity of diverse voices coming together to explore its key themes, this book is an important starting point for educators in many arenas. It brings into better focus a vital role for theEarth's ecosystems in the context of ecosociocultural theory and participatory democracy alike."Encompassing theoretical, empirical, and experiential standpoints concerning place-based knowledge systems, this unique book argues for a transformation of (science) education's intellectual tradition of thinking that emphasizes individual cognition. In its place, the book offers a wisdom tradition of thinking, living, and being that emphasizes community survival in harmony within itself and with Mother Earth." Glen AikenheadOnly book that creates a confluence between ecojustice ethics and decision-making Pertinent to course development for both environmental and science education Clearly lays out the commonalities between ecojustice, place-based, and indigenous knowledge Supports new visions and research directions for 21st century schooling},

	abstract = {Cents and Sustainability is a clear-sighted response to the 1987 call by Dr Gro Brundtland in Our Common Future to achieve a new era of economic growth that is 'forceful and at the same time socially and environmentally sustainable'. The Brundtland Report argued that not only was it achievable, but that it was an urgent imperative in order to achieve a transition to sustainable development while significantly reducing poverty and driving 'clean and green' investment. With some still arguing for significantly slowing economic growth in order to reduce pressures on the environment, this new book, Cents and Sustainability, shows that it is possible to reconcile the need for economic growth and environmental sustainability through a strategy to decouple economic growth from environmental pressures, combined with a renewed commitment to achieve significant environmental restoration and poverty reduction. Beginning with a brief overview of some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, the book then explains 'decoupling theory', overviews a number of factors that can undermine and even block efforts to decouple in both developed and developing countries, and then discusses a number of key considerations to assist the development of national 'decoupling strategies'. The book then focuses on presenting evidence to support greater action, not just on climate change, but also on decoupling economic growth from the loss of biodiversity and the deterioration of natural systems, freshwater extraction, waste production, and air pollution.In the lead up to the 2012 United Nations Earth Summit and beyond, Cents and Sustainability will be a crucial guide to inform and assist nations to develop strategies to significantly reduce environmental pressures, strengthen their economy, create jobs and reduce poverty. 'I commend the team from The Natural Edge Project and their partners for undertaking to develop a response to 'Our Common Future' to mark its 20th anniversary.'

The industry has moved beyond its infancy, and is now entering a maturing phase with increased numbers and types of vessels, more demanding routes, and more regular and predictable patterns of activity. The increase in cruise activities, and the associated risks of accidents, as well as the potential and actual impacts of the large numbers of tourists in the polar regions bring with it management challenges for sustainable use of these regions. This book discusses critically the issues around environmental and social sustainability of the cruise industry in Polar Regions.

	abstract = {Resource availability may affect both individual fitness and population demography and the effects can interact. We used two experiments to test how breeding resource abundance and its spatial distribution, combined with female abundance, affected male reproductive behavior, population spawning rate, and embryo development and recruitment in the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), a small cyprinid fish that lays its eggs in living unionid mussels. In the first experiment, we found that at the population level the abundance of breeding resources (freshwater mussels) was more important for bitterling recruitment than resource spatial distribution (clumped or regular). In contrast at the individual level, (variability in reproductive success) the spatial distribution of resources was more important, but only when resource abundance was not limiting. Territorial males obtained almost exclusive access to fertilizations when resources were abundant and distributed regularly, but were unable to defend large clusters of resources (when rival abundance was always high) and abandoned territoriality. Surprisingly, territorial males remained aggressive and successfully defended their territories when resources were grouped into a single cluster, but at a low abundance. In the second experiment, more rapid embryo development and larger juvenile body size at the end of the growing season was detected at high resource abundance and low female abundance, indicating that early hatched juveniles survived better and hence investment in offspring production early in the season yields a higher fitness pay-offs. The abundance of females in spawning condition was the best overall predictor of the intensity of male reproductive behavior in both experiments.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Freshwater harmful algal blooms (HABs) are comprised of algae that either create health hazards for humans or animals through the production of toxins or bioactive compounds or that cause deterioration of water quality through the build-up of high biomass, which degrades aesthetic, ecological, and recreational values. While freshwater HABs occur naturally, human actions that disturb ecosystems in the form of increased nutrient loadings and pollution, modified hydrology, and introduced species have been linked to the increased occurrence of some freshwater HABs. The majority of the freshwater HAB problems reported in the United States and worldwide are due to one group of algae, the cyanobacteria HABs (CyanoHABs), but other groups of algae can also be harmful. CyanoHABs are not a new phenomenon, but the frequency and geographic distribution of documented CyanoHABs seem to have dramatically increased in recent decades in the United States and globally. This book describes the broad range of negative impacts that freshwater HAB toxins have on humans, animals and aquatic ecosystems and actions that must be taken to resolve this issue.

	abstract = {Algae are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms in marine and freshwater ecosystems and are essential, energy-producing components of aquatic food webs. Harmful algal bloom or "HAB" species are a small subset of algal species that produce toxins and/or bloom to excess, thus creating harm to humans and ecosystems. Humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, including endangered species, can be exposed to algal toxins through their food, drinking water, the water in which they swim, or aerosols. It is widely believed that the frequency and geographic distribution of HABs have been increasing worldwide. All U.S. coastal states have experienced HABs over the last decade, and new species have emerged in some locations that were not previously known to cause problems.

Each commentary gives a short assessment of a topic, summarizing in a non-technical way the current state of analysis or evidence on the issue, along with selected recommendations for further reading. The essays are written by world renowned scholars, mostly economists, and provide useful insights on policy problems that are often complex and poorly understood. Some of the topics covered include air pollution, hazardous waste, voluntary environmental programs, domestic (U.S.) and global climate policy design, fishery management, water quality, endangered species, forest fires, oil security, solar power, road and airport, fuel taxes and fuel economy standards, alternative fuel vehicles, health and longevity, smoking, malaria, tuberculosis, and the environment and development. The objective is to disseminate the findings of sound, objective research on the costs, benefits, and appropriate reform of public policies. The book provides a useful supplement for undergraduate- and graduate-level course reading, a reference guide for professionals, and a way for the general reader to quickly develop an informed perspective on the most important policy problems of the day.Issues of the Day is available to download as a PDF from the Resources for the Future website: www.rff.org/weeklycommentary},

	abstract = {Evolutionary Behavioral Ecology is intended to be used as a text for graduate students and a sourcebook for professional scientists seeking an understanding of the evolutionary and ecological processes shaping behavior across a wide array of organisms and a diverse set of behaviors. Chapters are written by leading experts in the field, providing a core foundation, a history of conceptual developments, and fresh insight into the controversies and themes shaping the continuing development of the field. Essays on adaptation, selection, fitness, genetics, plasticity, and phylogeny as they pertain to behavior place the field in the broader context of ecology and evolution. These concepts, along with a diversity of theoretical approaches are applied to the evolution of behavior in a many contexts, from individual decision-making of solitary animals through to complex social interactions. Chapters integrate conceptual and theoretical approaches with recent empirical advances to understand the evolution of behavior, from foraging, dealing with risk, predator avoidance, and an array of social behaviors, including fighting and cooperation with conspecifics and conflict and cooperation between the sexes. The material emphasizes integrative and novel approaches to behavior, including cognitive ecology, personality, conservation biology, the links between behavior and evolution, the evolution of human social behavior, and ways in which modern genetic analyses can augment the study of behavior.},

This book puts forward some key strategies for promoting Cleaner Production in China, for instance, integrating CP into sustainability strategies, technology innovations and industrial ecology. Furthermore, the authors examine the Energy Masting Planning, a comprehensive plan that addresses energy supply and consumption through 2020. The plan includes energy efficiency, renewable energy and infrastructure and land use policies and emphasizes both the benefits and the limits of the approach. Furthermore, removal of toxic and heavy metal contaminants from aqueous environments is one of the most important environmental issues to face the world. In this book, aerobic degradation through bioaccumulation by bacteria and microalgae and enzyme-catalyzed reduction-based remediation of toxicants from waste waters are discussed. Other chapters in this book examine the attitudes of university students towards the environment and environmental problems, the influence on the causes of forest decline and an analysis of specific factors that influence the nominal median price of single-family homes across states, with a particular emphasis placed on the capitalization of environmental factors such as environmental pollution in the form of toxic chemical releases.},

These make up the Pontchartrain estuary. Robert W. Hastings provides a thorough examination of the historical and environmental research on the basin, with emphasis on its environmental degradation and the efforts to restore and protect this estuarine system. He also explores the current biological condition of the lakes.
Hastings begins with the geological formation of the lakes and the relationship between Native Americans and the water they referred to as Okwa'ta, the "wide water." From the historical period, he describes the forays of French explorer Pierre Le Moyne D'Iberville in 1699 and traces the environmental history of the basin through the development of the New Orleans metropolitan area. Using the lakes for transportation and then recreation, the surrounding population burgeoned, and this growth resulted in severe water pollution and other environmental problems. In the 1980s the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation led a concerted drive to restore the lakes, an ongoing effort that has proved significant.},

	abstract = {Temperature impacts the behaviour, physiology and ecology of all organisms more than any other abiotic variable. In this book, the author draws on theory from the more general discipline of evolutionary ecology to foster a fresh approach toward a theory of thermal adaptation. -;Temperature profoundly impacts both the phenotypes and distributions of organisms. These thermal effects exert strong selective pressures on behaviour, physiology and life history when environmental temperatures vary over space and time. Despite temperature's significance, progress toward a quantitative theory of thermal adaptation has lagged behind empirical descriptions of patterns and processes. In this book, the author draws on theory from the more general discipline of. evolutionary ecology to establish a framework for interpreting empirical studies of thermal biology. This novel synthesis of theoretical and empirical work generates new insights about the process of thermal adaptation and points the way towards a more general theory. The threat of rapid climatic change on a. global scale provides a stark reminder of the challenges that remain for thermal biologists and adds a sense of urgency to this book's mission. Thermal Adaptation will benefit anyone who seeks to understand the relationship between environmental variation and phenotypic evolution. The book focuses on quantitative evolutionary models at the individual, population and community levels, and successfully integrates this theory with modern empirical approaches. By providing a synthetic overview of evolutionary thermal biology, this accessible text will appeal to both graduate students and established researchers in the fields of. comparative, ecological, and evolutionary physiology. It will also interest the broader audience of professional ecologists and evolutionary biologists who require a comprehensive review of this topic, as well as those researchers working on the applied problems of regional and global climate. change. -},

The River Skalice, heavily contaminated with PCBs, was selected as a model. The source of contamination was a road gravel processing factory in Rozmitál pod Tremsínem from which an estimated 1 metric ton of PCBs leaked in 1986. Levels of PCB were measured in leeches collected between 1992 to 2003 from 11 sites covering about 50 km of the river (the first sampling site upstream to the source of contamination and 10 sites downstream). The PCB indicator congeners IUPA no. 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180 were measured. Levels were highest at the four sampling sites nearest the source of pollution. The highest values of PCB congeners were found in 1992. PCB content decreased from 1992 to 2003 and with distance from the source. The study indicated that leeches of the genus Erpobdella are a suitable bioindicator of contamination in the surface layer of river sediments.},

This book provides a broad account of numerous advances in that field - a rapidly developing discipline covering the application of information and communication technologies, modelling and computational intelligence in aquatic environments. A systematic survey, classified according to the methods used (neural networks, fuzzy logic and evolutionary optimization, in particular) is offered, together with illustrated practical applications for solving various water-related issues. These include, but are not limited to, flood estimation, rainfall-runoff modelling, rehabilitation of urban water networks, estimation of ocean temperature profiles, etc. Particular attention is also given to certain aspects of the most recent technological progress in hydroinformatics including the development of protocols for model integration and of computer architectures for modern modelling systems. Invited contributions were obtained from leading international experts - including academics, hydrological practitioners and industrial professionals - such that this edited volume constitutes an authoritative source of reference material and is essential reading for active workers in this field.Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras},

	abstract = {In a culmination of humanity's millennia-long quest for self knowledge, the sciences of the mind are now in a position to offer concrete, empirically validated answers to the most fundamental questions about human nature. What does it mean to be a mind? How is the mind related to the brain? How are minds shaped by their embodiment and environment? What are the principles behind cognitive functions such as perception, memory, language, thought, and consciousness? By analyzing the tasks facing any sentient being that is subject to stimulation and a pressure to act, Shimon Edelman identifies computation as the common denominator in the emerging answers to all these questions. Any system composed of elements that exchange signals with each other and occasionally with the rest of the world can be said to be engaged in computation. A brain composed of neurons is one example of a system that computes, and the computations that the neurons collectively carry out constitute the brain's mind. Edelman presents a computational account of the entire spectrum of cognitive phenomena that constitutes the mind. He begins with sentience, and uses examples from visual perception to demonstrate that it must, at its very core, be a type of computation. Throughout his account, Edelman acknowledges the human mind's biological origins. Along the way, he also demystifies traits such as creativity, language, and individual and collective consciousness, and hints at how naturally evolved minds can transcend some of their limitations by moving to computational substrates other than brains. The account that Edelman gives in this book is accessible, yet unified and rigorous, and the big picture he presents is supported by evidence ranging from neurobiology to computer science. The book should be read by anyone seeking a comprehensive and current introduction to cognitive psychology.},

The reduction of TRO by temperature (°K) was found to fit a curvilinear relationship in distilled water (r2 = 0.997) and a linear relationship in seawater (r2 = 0.996). Based on the decay rate, flow rate, and the length of cooling water flowing through at a given temperature, the TRO level in the cooling water of a power plant could be estimated using the equation developed in this study. This predictive model would provide a benchmark for power plant operators to adjust the addition of chlorine to levels necessary to control bio-fouling of cooling water intake pipelines, but without irritating ambient marine organisms.},

It then considers the response to conditions such as climate change, putting today's preoccupations into a long-term perspective. This is a book of history, not prophecy, and so makes no judgements on current anxieties. Key features:*Includes a glossary of unfamiliar terms *Notable in being a history and not a polemic *Examines the interrelation of history and nature, drawing on many fields of learning *Extensive coverage makes this ideal background reading for more specialised treatments and studies},

Drain all the water from your boat, live wells, bilge and motor before relaunching your boat. Destroy organisms on your boat, waders, wading boots and other gear by leaving them in the sun for five days or spraying them with hot water or a mild bleach solution.


I know that, when you read about invasive species, it seems like it is a battle that we cannot win. I believe we can win this battle. To do so, we must all make every effort to prevent the spread of these dangers to our waters. Rinse your boat carefully after fishing out of province.

	abstract = {Aquaculture is a rapidly growing industry and aquaculture practices can directly interact with and depend upon the surrounding environment. Therefore, the effects of all types of aquaculture on living natural resources and ecosystems are of significant and increasing national and international interest. In Ecological and Genetic Implications of Aquaculture Activities, numerous nationally and internationally prominent aquaculture researchers contribute 27 chapters that comprise overviews of aquaculture effects on the environment, discussions of genetic considerations, thorough documentation of aquaculture effects and their solutions specific to countries, and approaches toward environmentally sustainable aquaculture. Together, these chapters comprise a comprehensive synthesis of many ecological and genetic problems implicated in the practice of aquaculture and of many proven, attempted, or postulated solutions to those problems. Many chapters can serve as benchmark documentations ofspecific aquaculture effects on biodiversity at different levels. The authorship is broadly international; the authors represent 18 different countries or international agencies and all continents except Antarctica. The aquaculture effects and their solutions range from local to global and simple to highly technical. Effects common to many levels and types of aquaculture emerge, as well as both common and unique solutions. 
Aquaculturists, aquaculture researchers, aquaculture industry developers, conservation biologists, environmental scientists, resource managers, and policy makers should find this book interesting and informative.Provides detailed descriptions of proven novel and interesting solutions to common aquaculture problems Provides worldwide overviews of major environmental and/or genetic effects of aquaculture An outstanding source of references for all types of aquaculture activities and all types of ecological and genetic effects that result from the practice of aquaculture},

	abstract = {Since the late 1980s, shallow lakes in Europe and North America have been receiving concerted attention from limnologists, fishery biologists and lake managers. These developments relate to deterioration of water quality in the lakes due to pollution and accelerated eutrophication, caused by increased urbanization and agriculture in the lake catchments, overexploitation of fish and higher water level fluctuations. The water-quality and management problems of lakes have led to a greater need for fundamental researches on shallow lakes in order to gain a deeper insight into the structure and functioning of the food web in these waters. New knowledge relating to littoral-pelagial interactions and the sediment-water interface has facilitated the development of new lake restoration techniques. 
This volume, with 41 peer-reviewed papers, comprises the proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes, which was held at Dalfsen, The Netherlands, on 5-9 June 2005. It has the theme Shallow Lakes in a Changing World and deals with water-quality issues, such as changes in lake limnology, especially those driven by eutrophication and pollution, increased nutrient loading and productivity, perennial blooms of cyanobacteria and loss of biodiversity. The general consensus is that the lakes under restoration respond by showing an increase in water clarity followed by an increase in macrophyte coverage and biomass. Consequently, there is now ground for theoretical speculations on the so-called 'alternate stable states' observed in many such lakes under restoration.Supplements and updates the issues related to eutrophication and pollution problems regarding many shallow lakes in Europe and North America Contains state-of-the art updates on water quality issues and different restoration techniques},

This volume represents new knowledge both on human and environmental risk assessment procedures and although it is generally acknowledged that chemical, biological, radiological, and other stressors can cause a variety of human health or ecological health effects, assessing the risks associated with them is considerably more complex methodologically and computationally than current risk assessment practices.

	abstract = {The Quest for Food: A Natural History of Eating is a collection of essays that surveys eating through time, from the perspective of a biologist. 
The quest begins in prehistoric times with religion and the exploration of the connection between food and sex. This leads to an investigation of the deep links between food and culture, exploring the basic question of "what is eating?" The second section embarks on a biochemistry-oriented journey tracing the path of a food molecule through the central carbon pathway until it is decomposed into CO2, H2O and ATP. The third section delves into the evolution of eating systems, beginning with the elements of the primordial soup through the birth of single cell organisms such as bacteria and archea. We then follow this evolution in the fourth section through higher developed organisms: from the first organisms in the ocean to the ones on land. The next two sections explore the stories of food from an ecological, then behavioral viewpoint, leading the reader from animals to early hominids, and into human history. The final section takes apart an anthropocentric view of the world by presenting man as prey for the oldest predators: microbes. The text closes with an agronomical outlook on how to feed the billions.
The goal of The Quest for Food is to catalyze discussions between scientists working in food science, and those in biological and biomedical research.

	abstract = {Fast repetition rate fluorescence (FRRF) and spectral fluorescence, together with measures of nutrients and pigments, were used to characterize the composition and photosynthetic physiology of Lake Ontario phytoplankton in late summer and relate them to environmental conditions. Two stations demonstrated effects from relatively heavy anthropogenic disturbance and showed that the response of phytoplankton physiology to different impacts is highly variable. Other stations were more similar in phytoplankton composition, and in situ fluorescence yields (F'{\textasciicircum}sub q{\textasciicircum}/F'{\textasciicircum}sub m{\textasciicircum}) in the lower surface mixed layer suggested good physiological condition (0.45-0.50). Nutrient ratios and mean irradiance indicated a general state of light saturation and slight phosphorus (P) deficiency, but physiological variations among stations were unrelated to measures of P deficiency. Fluorescence yields often decreased when surface layer samples were held in the dark, consistent with an induction of chlororespiration and prior exposure to supersaturating levels of irradiance. Comparative estimates of photosynthesis by FRRF and {\textasciicircum}sup 14{\textasciicircum}C revealed disparities suggestive of substantial differences between in situ and incubation methods, while spectral fluorescence appeared to underestimate cyanobacterial abundance. FRRF parameters, particularly F'{\textasciicircum}sub q{\textasciicircum}/F'{\textasciicircum}sub m{\textasciicircum}, were effective in identifying higher-impact stations and showed promise as an efficient means of characterizing variations in phytoplankton condition that may underlie phenomena such as taste and odour production.

	abstract = {This book is addressed to students, researchers and academics who have barely heard of the emerging young science of Biosemiotics, and who want to know more about it. Written by many of the field's major contributors, it provides a highly qualified introduction to Biosemiotics and illustrates the most recent views in its background and development. 
Combining research approaches from biology, philosophy and linguistics, the field of Biosemiotics proposes that animals, plants and single cells all engage in semiosis - the conversion of objective signals into conventional signs. This has important implications and applications for issues ranging from natural selection to animal behavior and human psychology, leaving biosemiotics at the cutting edge of the research on the fundamentals of life.
Drawing on an international expertise, the book details the history and study of biosemiotics, and provides a state-of-the-art summary of the current work in this new field. And, with relevance to a wide range of disciplines - from linguistics and semiotics to evolutionary phenomena and the philosophy of biology - the book provides an important text for both students and established researchers, while marking a vital step in the evolution of a new biological paradigm.

Now that it is near completion, the logjam seems to be releasing. The environmental assessment can begin, and the financial partners, including Stelco, and the Port Authority can find out how much it will cost to complete the project.


Other priorities on her environment list include getting the Hamilton Harbour de-listed as an Area of Concern from the International Joint Commission's "hot spot" list, and establishing proper clean-up protocols for ocean-going ships to prevent further invasive species from invading the harbour. Already the harbour is home to the zebra mussel and gobie fish, deposited into the Great Lakes from ocean-going ships' ballasts.},

	abstract = {Partial Order? - Never heard of it!
This comment will be heard no more, when the broadness of this mathematical concept has been explained. Many internationally renowned authors assist the reader in understanding what partial order is and where, why and how this concept can be used. Since all the authors have teaching experience, partial order is explained step by step. Mathematical formalism is avoided as far as ever possible. The book begins with some basics, considers applications in different fields and ends with some historical notes.
After reading this book, the comment should become: Partial order! - Where is the next book?A primer in a mathematical technique which is useful in many expanding disciplines, like genomics, techniques of decision support, and sustainability
Rainer Brüggemann studied chemistry at the Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich. He received his PhD in 1977. He joined a research group in 1980 at the Technical University of Berlin. 1984 saw him move to the GSF - National Research Center for Environment and Health in Neuherberg near Munich. Since 1996 he is senior scientist at the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries, Berlin.

Lars Carlsen studied chemistry at the University in Copenhagen. He received his PhD in 1977 and his DSc in 1989. In 1991 he joined the National Environmental Research Institute in Denmark as Director of the Department of Environmental Chemistry. Since 1999 he has been an assigned professor in environmental chemistry at the Roskilde University, Denmark, and in 2000 he founded his own consultancy, "Awareness Center".},

Most of us are however blissfully unaware of the looming environmental catastrophe, though, the cliche words like ecosystem, sustainable development, and ecotourism are flying about. Few are really conscious about the logistics and the energy required to put ecological knowledge into practice. The aim of this small book is to bring within the reach of educated laymen, both the science as well as the philosophy of Ecology in simple and non-technical English. The first seven chapters of the book explain in simple English, with minimum technicalities, the basic principles of ecology and how the animals and the plants of the entire world are mutually dependant for their survival and flourishing. The eighth chapter gives some kaleidoscopic glimpses of the beauties of the various ecosystems on Earth?s surface, and how the animals and plants of each ecosystem are beautifully adapted to suit the specific demands of each of them. The last two chapters i.e., ninth and tenth have been devoted to outline, how owing to the insatiable greed and anthropocentric attitude of Homo Sapiens, the green envelope of our Mother Earth is being wrecked everywhere with painful consequences?},

	abstract = {Interactions matter. To understand the distributions of plants and animals in a landscape you need to understand how they interact with each other, and with their environment. The resulting networks of interactions make ecosystems highly complex. Recent research on complexity and artificial life provides many new insights about patterns and processes in landscapes and ecosystems. This book provides the first overview of that work for general readers. It covers such topics as connectivity, criticality, feedback, and networks, as well as their impact on the stability and predictability of ecosystem dynamics. With over 60 years of research experience of both ecology and complexity, the authors are uniquely qualified to provide a new perspective on traditional ecology. They argue that understanding ecological complexity is crucial in today's globalized and interconnected world. Successful management of the world's ecosystems needs to combine models of ecosystem complexity with biodiversity, environmental, geographic and socioeconomic information.Combines ecology, landscapes and complexity Outlines a new framework for understanding complex ecological systems in landscapes Pitched at the general reader unlike other accounts of this area},

Twelve sites are discussed in detail, integrating physics and biology, and between science and engineering. In turn these are linked to economic and social issues. These sites are Tokyo Bay, the Pearl Estuary, Hong Kong, Shanghai and the Yangtze delta, Klang, Manila Bay, Jakarta Bay, Pearl Harbor, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok and the upper Gulf of Thailand, Singapore, and Darwin. This is the shoreline of about 50 million people and the coastal waters of about 500 million people. Sixty prominent scientists and engineers in universities and research centres in all these cities contributed the chapters in this book.

	abstract = {The systematic description of the knowledge accumulated on the physical oceanography, marine chemistry and pollution, and marine biology of the Caspian Sea forms the basis of this book. It presents the principal characteristic features of the environmental conditions of the sea and their changes in the second half of the 20th century. At present, the principal problems of the Caspian Sea are related to the interannual sea level changes and their forecast and to the estimation of the intensity of the chemical pollution of the sea and its impact upon the biota. Special attention is paid to socio-economic, legal, and political issues in the Caspian Sea region. This publication is based on numerous observational data collected by the authors of the chapters during sea expeditions, on the archive data of several Russian oceanographic institutions, as well as on the broad scientific literature mainly published in Russian editions.; This book is addressed to the specialists concerned with research in various fields of physical oceanography, marine chemistry, pollution studies, and biology; solving a wide scope of problems from the regional climate to the mesoscale processes; and using a variety of methods from remote sensing of the seas to numerical and laboratory modeling.},

Although further survey work remains in eastern and northern sectors of the lake, [Jeff Schaeffer] has begun drawing preliminary conclusions.


The decline of alewife and a resurgence in native species has opened the door to a potential future for Lake Huron which no one has seriously considered until now, Schaeffer said. It's the idea that environmental planners can now begin to think of the restoration, rather than simply the rehabilitation, of fish habitat.

	abstract = {Feeding rates of the calanoid copepod Leptodiaptomus sicilis on natural assemblages of phytoplankton and microzooplankton were evaluated during late winter and early spring in Lake Michigan. Microzooplankton were the preferred food source for this copepod, and larger size fractions of phytoplankton were preferred to smaller size fractions. Ingestion rates of total chlorophyll a ranged from 2 to 14 ng.copepod{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}.day{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}, while ingestion rates of microzooplankton biomass ranged from 0.04 to 0.15 µg C.copepod{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}.day{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}. In these experiments, microzooplankton carbon accounted for 22\%-74\% of the total carbon ingested. Clearance rates of microzooplankton carbon were positively related to the larger size fractions of chlorophyll a and to total suspended solids. Measured ingestion rates of microzooplankton and phytoplankton carbon suggest that calanoid copepod populations have the potential to control microzooplankton production in late winter and early spring, and even with an abundance of phytoplankton carbon, food availability may limit the reproduction of L. sicilis. Because microzooplankton contribute significantly to the diet of these copepods, stimulation of the microbial food web by terrigenous inputs of nutrients and carbon may be transmitted to higher trophic levels (i.e., mesozooplankton and their predators) through heterotrophic flagellates and protozoans.

Consequently, the seas are constantly infused with wastewater bacteria, among them highly pathogenic ones. In view of the public health significance of this phenomenon, it is surprising how little is actually known concerning the fate of such bacteria once they enter the sea. This book therefore looks at the survival, infectivity, pathogenicity and viability of enteric bacteria in the sea. Chapters also detail the public health aspects of wastewater release, civil engineering and economic considerations, other sources of pathogens, and much more.

	abstract = {The first conceptual framework, which I call the "sovereignty first and foremost" school, assumes that Canada's sovereignty is tied directly to the ice. Franklyn Griffiths refers to this as the "sovereignty on thinning ice" theory.' According to this way of thinking, any solutions or suggestions regarding the passage must have as their end objective the solidification of Canada's total legal control. The second framework, the "sovereignty to one side" framework, holds the sovereignty issue constant, as it were, in order to concentrate on the more practical issues associated with an ice-free passage such as protecting the environment, ensuring the security of Canada and the North American continent, facilitating navigation, breaking ice, harvesting and protecting raw materials and resources, and monitoring and enforcing national and international laws. This school of thought believes sovereignty is important. However, rather than being tangled in a legal imbroglio, proponents of this school prefer to "put sovereignty to the side" while they tackle other, related issues.              The difficulty one has outlining the sovereignty first and foremost framework is that, while its advocates are very vocal and urgent in their pleas, their policies are rather elusive. Continued insistence that the passage is within Canada's historic internal waters may not be sufficient. Therefore, I will use Franklyn Griffith's critique of the "alarmist" view to describe the sovereignty first and foremost school of thought. His article, "The shipping news, Canada's arctic sovereignty not on thinning ice,"8 is largely a rebuttal to his "former self" in which he admittedly provided the trumpet from which to sound the alarm. As Griffiths once declared himself alarmist, his critique is very instructive.              According to Griffiths, the alarmists are the "southern Canadians" who insist on exaggerating the threat global warming poses to Canada's legal claim of the Northwest Passage. Furthermore, they perpetuate a "sovereignty-on-thinning-ice thesis" via three fallacies: rapidly decreasing ice conditions, a new and large commercial shipping interest, and the worsening of Canada-US relations.9 With the recent research from the Canadian arctic shelf exchange study (CASES)10 and the recent arctic climate impact assessment (ACAI) study" seemingly confirming some of the alarmists' predictions, the bureaucrats, in Griffiths' opinion, are rushing to put together an ill-conceived plan to establish Canada's hold on the passage once and for all. Griffiths contends that the alarmists have made the ultimate slippery slope argument, equating thinning ice to loss of sovereignty. In other words, the argument is that Canada is peering over a dangerous precipice so it is better to act hurriedly than not to act at all. Their position, according to Griffiths, can be summarized as follows.},

	abstract = {This study was designed to evaluate the risk that tributyltin (TBT) levels in harbour sediments pose to the freshwater invertebrate Hyalella azteca and to rank TBT as an environmental concern compared with inorganic metal species. Four-week toxicity tests and 2-week bioaccumulation tests were conducted with sediments collected from five harbours historically contaminated with TBT: Montreal, Kingston, Toronto, Hamilton, and Port Weller. While there was no observable effect of TBT on survival or growth of H. azteca, bioaccumulation of TBT exceeded levels expected to cause chronic toxicity in some sediments from Kingston, Montreal, and Port Weller. There was a positive relationship between TBT in H. azteca and TBT in sediments (r{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} = 0.72), although TBT in field sediments was less bioavailable than in laboratory-spiked sediments. Body concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, nickel, and thallium were well below levels expected to cause toxicity in H. azteca. However, overlying water concentrations of copper and zinc approached or exceeded levels of concern in Toronto, Hamilton, and Port Weller sediments. This research suggests that levels of TBT in harbour sediments may cause chronic toxicity to H. azteca and freshwater invertebrate species of similar sensitivity and that copper and zinc also pose a risk at these sites.

	abstract = {All around the lot where I live, European buckthorn (a shrub or small tree) is thriving. New trunks seem to sprout from the dense clumps of buckthorn all the time, each new shoot reaching farther than the last to get out from under the shade of its siblings. Together they form such a dense cover that almost nothing is able to grow on the forest floor beneath it, not poplar, birch, alder, pine, cedar or even forest wildflowers like trilliums and trout lily.


Who can blame the buckthorn for fighting back, though? It was a case of one invasive species against another. Peterborough Green- Up's fact-sheet on invasive species describes these "bullies of the plant world" as plants that spread so well "they choke out native plants, reducing biodiversity and destroying habitat." Sounds like us European settlers, doesn't it, if you broaden the conversation to include animals? Just ask an aboriginal person.


Not only are human beings the most invasive species of all, we're also the ones responsible for bringing the rest of the invaders here in the first place. Many of the plants we brought over, also known as aliens or exotics, get along quite well with the native species. It's the aggressive ones we have to look out for. They tend to take over in disturbed or stressed sites -- the edges of road or building construction, vacant lots, or abandoned marginal farmland.},

Its accessible format fosters better communication between the health and geoscience communities by elucidating the geologic origins and flow of toxic elements in the environment that lead to human exposure through the consumption of food and water. For example, problems of excess intake from drinking water have been encountered for several inorganic compounds, including fluoride in Africa and India; arsenic in certain areas of Argentina, Chile, and Taiwan; selenium in seleniferous areas in the U.S., Venezuela, and China; and nitrate in agricultural areas with heavy use of fertilizers. Environmental influences on vector borne diseases and stormflow water quality influences are also featured. Numerous examples of the environmental influences on human health from across the globe are also presented and discussed in this volume. * Covers recent advances and future research topics at the intersection of environmental science and public health* Developed by 60 experts from 20 countries and edited by professionals from the International Working Group on Medical Geology* Includes 200+ color photographs and illustrations* Organizes information in a highly structured format for easy reference* Written for a broad audience, ranging from students, researchers, and medical professionals to policymakers and the general public},

Ministry of Natural Resources' statistics show that the number of 14-inch fish has dropped from 200,000 to 100,000 over the last four years. And while short-term declines can be common in nature, this is not the case in Rice Lake or the rest of the Kawarthas for that matter.                 The jury is still out on this, but there is a theory or two that deserves a closer look. Many biologists think the decline in the walleye numbers is due in part to the colonization of zebra mussels in the chain of lakes that started in the early 1990s. The filter- feeding mussels, an alien from Asia's Caspian Sea introduced to Canada through ship ballast water, have increased water clarity in the Kawarthas making them less productive for walleye.                 Are they eating too many young walleye and eggs? The consensus is yes, but no one knows for sure yet. There is no doubt about the toll taken on the walleye population by pike though. A recent and unwanted introduction to the Kawarthas, pike feed on walleye and also compete with the resident muskie population.},

According to the report, algae that is not eaten by the mussels falls to the bottom of the lake and acts as fertilizer for aquatic weeds. When it is eaten by the mussels, it makes the water more clear and provides more light to the weeds, said Keyser.


Anyone with lakefront property who is interested in participating in this year's E. coli, phosphorus, weed growth and the newly initiated benthic bug research should contact Keyser at 705-654- 3839},

	abstract = {Environmentalists, too, use the concept of "product" as a point of departure for their framings of the aquaculture industry. One Georgia Strait Alliance publication highlights the metaphorical change that occurs when fish are turned from animals into products. Under the heading "messing with mother nature," fish farming is placed in stark contrast to wild salmon which are "one of Nature's miracles": "no one really understands the homing instinct that brings them from thousands of miles away back to the exact river, stream or creek where they were born" (Fish Farm Fiasco Factsheet \#1). As soon as fish are accepted as being mysterious and sacred, we can no longer easily turn them into the carefully crafted, boxed, and marketed products that farmed salmon become in the frames employed by the industry. In fact, salmon farming is rejected on the grounds that it invades and circumvents nature's own processes for growing fish: "like factory-raised chickens, farmed salmon are fooled into fattening faster. Some farms use bright lights to confuse them into thinking all day -- and night -- is feeding time" (Georgia Strait Alliance, Fish Farm Fiasco Factsheet \#3). Farmed salmon are compared to farmed chicken that spend their "short, miserable lives" in "cruel conditions"; "that's why many consumers spend a little extra money to buy free-range eggs" (Georgia Strait Alliance, Fish Farm Fiasco Factsheet \#3). In place of salmon as a product, the environmentalists here create and attempt to have us respond to nature as a living, organic whole. It is this organic solidarity which is presented as an alternative to the more mechanistic solidarity of the aquaculture industry's product frame.              People, like animals, can be framed as imagineered products. For a period of time in the late 1990s, the BC Salmon Farmers Association ran a newspaper advertisement which featured a photograph of a man, with the headline: "Salmon farming is a sustainable, high-tech industry that allows me to live and work in a coastal community" (Vancouver Sun, August 24, 1996, A7). The caption indicates that the man is in fact "Jamie Bridge, Biologist, Salmon Farm Technician, Nanaimo, BC." Most likely, this is a real individual, with a real job, in the real community of Nanaimo. Although this person is pictured, the photograph hides the fact that it has become almost impossible to isolate one instance of the salmon farmer. Jamie Bridge is a fish farm technician, yet his work seems to be superseded by the industry's growth potential, of which he is cited as a mere example. The advertisement describes finfish farm workers' careers as built up around, and defined by, the "increasingly competitive world market:" "today we employ skilled workers and advanced aquaculture technology to produce a premium food product." It therefore becomes difficult to determine, in typical post-modern style, whether a human-being is at the center of what it means to be a salmon farm worker, or whether it is instead "productivity," "competitiveness" and "expansion" that are the models of which actual people are the instances: "Sustaining the health and productivity of our farms is one of the reasons BC salmon farmers need more farm sites.... I'm proud to be a salmon farmer." A whole world of simulated meaning closes in on the meaning of farmed salmon. Subject and periphery are no longer distinguishable; whenever they try to locate one example of a fish farmer, the salmon farming proponents are already on the other side in their talk about the nameless and faceless forces of efficiency and control. The common-sensical concepts surrounding fish as products become dissolved in a set of simulated people and activities that are themselves turned into products. In this way, as will be explained later, common-sensical and hyper-real framings can build upon and depend upon one another.},

These leeches consume blood, which means they come into contact with the bloodstream of host animals (including humans).

The import of leeches has already been restricted to licensed bait dealers, but that has not stopped the increasing popularity of leeches among anglers.

The theory scientists are probing is that the goby, a fish that dwells at the bottom of the lakes, is eating the zebra mussel and dying from the toxin. The toxin is suspected of effectively climbing the food chain to other fish, fish-eating birds, ducks and even a small number of eagles.},

	abstract = {OTTAWA - Can a Frankenfish outlast the killer bees and zebra mussels? What with the Martin-Chretien feud, the much-hyped G8 summit and the perishing heat, only the most vigilant readers will have heard about this summer's terrifying eco-hazard. (That is why I am here.)                 True to the time-honoured eco-hazard template, the Frankenfish is described as a "ferocious predator." It is, as so many recent eco- hazards seem to be, an import from China (which suggests an unresolved xenophobia in this country and a promising topic for a post-grad cultural studies thesis). However, unlike most invaders, the snakehead did not first arrive on this continent in the hold of a cargo ship. It is an aquarium species and a delicacy in some Asian cuisines.                 Some sources suggest the sample found in that Maryland pond may have escaped from a bankrupt pet store in a nearby strip mall (which isn't to suggest that strip malls can be construed as a natural habitat). It goes without saying that the northern snakehead has no known predators. Or that it poses a dreadful threat to vulnerable native species. Or that it reproduces with indecent haste and frequency. There is one seldom-mentioned trait all these avaricious newcomers share, however: They only seem to spread in summer and in the absence of more compelling news. By fall, when the regular news cycle reasserts itself, the mutant invaders drop out of sight entirely, only to reappear in subsequent summers in far less virulent form.},

	abstract = {On our own trip, my work was to investigate the biodiversity and ecology of hydroids--which belong to a major group or "phylum" of invertebrate animals known as Cnidaria--in waters around this rugged and volcanic chain of islands. Cnidaria also includes corals, sea fans, sea anemones, jelly-fishes, and their relatives. An important part of the sea's food web, 3200 species of hydroid are found worldwide. Fire corals, familiar to divers for their painful sting, are really hydroids, not true corals. The "airferns" often sold in florist shops are actually a species of air-dried and green-dyed hydroid. Plant-like in appearance, hydroids usually attach themselves to and grow on submerged objects. Like zebra mussels, barnacles, and algae, they can become pests, fouling the bottoms of ships and the cooling-water intakes of industrial plants. A few, like the fire corals, are venomous to humans. Others may hold potential in biomedical research. The ROM is one of the few places in the world where studies are carried out on these obscure "lower invertebrates," and our collections are among the best anywhere. I knew that compiling an inventory of hydroids in the Galapagos would be useful for other biologists in assessing the overall biodiversity of the islands, baseline data so necessary to understanding how the region's ecosystems operate and how best to protect them.


Biologists know that the terrestrial life of the Galapagos, studied extensively over the past couple of centuries, is enigmatic. But the marine environment and sea life of the islands, much less investigated, is downright paradoxical. Though the archipelago straddles the equator, where you might expect to find balmy waters, extensive reefs, and an explosion of biodiversity, neither the surrounding waters nor the resident sea life are typical of the tropics. The coral reefs are localized and little developed. The diversity of marine fauna and flora is comparatively low, and many species that are widespread in the tropical Pacific are absent altogether. And yet, at the same time, marine productivity and fertility is higher than might be expected in an equatorial region.


Back in my lab at the ROM, the process of sorting and identifying the newly collected hydroids and adding them to the database is still in progress. Already, my ROM colleagues and I have documented about 100 species of hydroids from the Galapagos area--some of the specimens are new to science. Predictably, the overall group seems most closely related to the fauna of the adjacent coast of South and Central America. Most of the species we found in the Galapagos were likely introduced from there long ago, rafting over on flotsam. The wide stretch of ocean is less of a barrier to colonization for marine life than for terrestrial plants and animals. That's why there are fewer marine species than terrestrial ones that are endemic to the Galapagos. As we expected from the relatively cool waters of the islands, certain hydroids that flourish in tropical areas of the Pacific are absent here--fire corals are a prime example. Instead, dozens of typically warm to temperate species were among those collected. With scientific names as exotic as the islands they inhabit--Turritopsis nutricula, Cladocoryne floccosa--each comprises an important part of the web of life around the Galapagos.},

Both dine on bacteria and algae, but the mussels multiply rapidly and can filter vast amounts of water.                 There also is speculation that there is enough food but mussels are extracting from it a nutrient essential to diporeia, that mussels introduced a pathogen lethal to diporeia, or that a mucouslike substance excreted by mussels is killing diporeia, said Thomas Nalepa, a research biologist at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab in Ann Arbor. The lab is part of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.                 Researchers have found no diporeia in Lake Erie since the early 1990s -- Tuchman said fisheries experts have reported a dramatic decline in rainbow smelt and young white fish there. Also, diporeia levels have collapsed in Lake Ontario and are disappearing from shallow waters of southern Lake Michigan.},

	abstract = {The rapid expansion of international trade has brought to the fore issues of conflicting national regulations in the area of plant, animal, and human health. These problems include the concern that regulations designed to protect health can also be used for protection of domestic producers against international competition. At a time when progressive tariff reform has opened up markets and facilitated trade, in part responding to consumer demands for access to a wide choice of products and services at reasonable prices, closer scrutiny of regulatory measures has become increasingly important. At the same time, there are clear differences among countries and cultures as to the types of risk citizens are willing to accept. The activities of this conference were based on the premise that risk analyses (i.e., risk assessment, management, and communication) are not exclusively the domain of the biological and natural sciences; the social sciences play a prominent role in describing how people in different contexts perceive and respond to risks. Any effort to manage sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues in international trade must integrate all the sciences to develop practices for risk assessment, management, and communication that recognize international diversity in culture, experience, and institutions. Uniform international standards can help, but no such norms are likely to be acceptable to all countries. Political and administrative structures also differ, causing differences in approaches and outcomes even when basic aims are compatible. Clearly there is considerable room for confusion and mistrust. The issue is how to balance the individual regulatory needs and approaches of countries with the goal of promoting freer trade. This issue arises not only for SPS standards but also in regard to regulations that affect other areas such as environmental quality, working conditions, and the exercise of intellectual property rights. This conference focused on these issues in the specific area of SPS measures. This area includes provisions to protect plant and animal health and life and, more generally, the environment, and regulations that protect humans from foodborne risks. The Society for Risk Analysis defines a risk as the potential for realization of unwanted, adverse consequences to human life, health, property, or the environment; estimation of risk is usually based on the expected value of the conditional probability of the event occurring times the consequence of the event given that it has occurred. The task of this conference and of this report was to elucidate the place of science, culture, politics, and economics in the design and implementation of SPS measures and in their international management. The goal was to explore the critical roles and the limitations of the biological and natural sciences and the social sciences, such as economics, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, and political science in the management of SPS issues and in judging whether particular SPS measures create unacceptable barriers to international trade. The conference's objective also was to consider the elements that would compose a multidisciplinary analytical framework for SPS decision making and needs for future research.

The resulting book finds New York City's watershed agreement to be a good template for proactive watershed management that, if properly implemented, will maintain high water quality. However, it cautions that the agreement is not a guarantee of permanent filtration avoidance because of changing regulations, uncertainties regarding pollution sources, advances in treatment technologies, and natural variations in watershed conditions.
The book recommends that New York City place its highest priority on pathogenic microorganisms in the watershed and direct its resources toward improving methods for detecting pathogens, understanding pathogen transport and fate, and demonstrating that best management practices will remove pathogens. Other recommendations, which are broadly applicable to surface water supplies across the country, target buffer zones, stormwater management, water quality monitoring, and effluent trading.},

	abstract = {The spread of introduced or invasive species has been one of many damaging environmental side-effects of the push towards a globalized economy. As worldwide trade has increased, species have been given free rides to virtually every corner of the planet, and that's meant big trouble to indigenous creatures, some of which have been pushed to the brink of extinction by invaders. Invasive species reach foreign ecosystems in a variety of ways. The ballast water of freighters, for example, is a virtual aquarium of exotic species and is routinely dumped in the harbours of port cities. Grain, lumber, fruit and millions of other goods are shipped around the world every day. These can carry insects, small mammals, plant spores or other organisms that are then released into new areas.


Every species on this planet has a role to play in the functioning of the biosphere as a whole. When introduced species run rampant and displace indigenous species, the result is a loss of biodiversity. In turn, this reduces the capacity of the Earth to fulfil the biological cycles that maintain all life. Ecologists are concerned that the spread of invasives could result in a few successful species dominating the planet, resulting in what some have dubbed a global McEcosystem.},

	abstract = {With age-appropriate, inquiry-centered curriculum materials and sound teaching practices, middle school science can capture the interest and energy of adolescent students and expand their understanding of the world around them. 

Resources for Teaching Middle School Science, developed by the National Science Resources Center (NSRC), is a valuable tool for identifying and selecting effective science curriculum materials that will engage students in grades 6 through 8. The volume describes more than 400 curriculum titles that are aligned with the National Science Education Standards.
This completely new guide follows on the success of
Resources for Teaching Elementary School Science, the first in the NSRC series of annotated guides to hands-on, inquiry-centered curriculum materials and other resources for science teachers.
The curriculum materials in the new guide are grouped in five chapters by scientific area?Physical Science, Life Science, Environmental Science, Earth and Space Science, and Multidisciplinary and Applied Science. They are also grouped by type?core materials, supplementary units, and science activity books.
Each annotation of curriculum material includes a recommended grade level, a description of the activities involved and of what students can be expected to learn, a list of accompanying materials, a reading level, and ordering information.
The curriculum materials included in this book were selected by panels of teachers and scientists using evaluation criteria developed for the guide. The criteria reflect and incorporate goals and principles of the National Science Education Standards. The annotations designate the specific content standards on which these curriculum pieces focus.
In addition to the curriculum chapters, the guide contains six chapters of diverse resources that are directly relevant to middle school science. Among these is a chapter on educational software and multimedia programs, chapters on books about science and teaching, directories and guides to science trade books, and periodicals for teachers and students.
Another section features institutional resources. One chapter lists about 600 science centers, museums, and zoos where teachers can take middle school students for interactive science experiences. Another chapter describes nearly 140 professional associations and U.S. government agencies that offer resources and assistance.
Authoritative, extensive, and thoroughly indexed?and the only guide of its kind?
Resources for Teaching Middle School Science will be the most used book on the shelf for science teachers, school administrators, teacher trainers, science curriculum specialists, advocates of hands-on science teaching, and concerned parents.},

Not the Jane Jacobs I know.              To the extent that the globalizers who lean on Jacobs are half right, it is mainly through an error of omission. They omit the critical essence of the urban organism that Jacobs' vision reveals, its immune system: local democracy. Like all organisms, a city stays vital when engaged citizens act as the white blood cells. Jacobs believes that a vigorous urban organism, with its life force of private enterprise, trade, competition, and innovation, requires a healthy and unrestrained civil society. She is adamant in opposing government and corporate policies which weaken citizen politics.              Jacobs' organic analysis appears somewhat inadequate in explaining the actions of those transnationals which are achieving immunity from local law and whose activities are beyond the reach of local civic action. This is particularly evident in Systems of Survival when the question of child labour and other exploitative practices are raised. One of Jacobs' personae, the interdisciplinary biologist, says that these 'are obsolete in commercially advanced societies.'(f.10) This is not true, as any educated consumer of oriental carpets or embroidered haute couture garments made in Asia knows. Small fingers for the fine work, they say. The suffering has been displaced offshore, and the levels and variety of abuse are on the increase. Jacobs' optimistic view of honest trade suffers from an apparent lack of interest in the invisible exploitation of people and resources in far-off places, both in her silent indifference to unjust international linkages and in her mainly benign view of global commerce.},
