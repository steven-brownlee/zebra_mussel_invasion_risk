	abstract = {Bitterlings are a group of teleost fish (Cyprinifromes: Acheilanathidae) notable for their brood parasitic lifestyle. Bitterling embryos develop as parasites inside the gill chamber of their freshwater mussel hosts. However, little is known about brain development in this species. Here, we have imaged the development of the brain of the Rosy Bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus) at four embryonic stages (165, 185, 210, 235 hours post-fertilization) using micro-computed tomography (microCT) with special emphasis on developmental regionalization and brain ventricular organization. We provide a detailed neuroanatomical account of the development of the brain divisions with reference to The Atlas of Early zebrafish Brain Development and the updated prosomeric model. Segmentation and three-dimensional visualization of the ventricular system were performed in order to clarify changes in the longitudinal brain axis as a result of cephalic flexure during development. During early embryonic and larval development, we find that histological differentiation, tissue boundaries, periventricular proliferation zones, and ventricular spaces are all recognizable using microCT. Importantly, our approach is validated by the fact that the profile of CT values displayed here in the bitterling brain are consistent with genoarchitecture identified in previous studies. We also find developmental heterochrony of the inferior lobe in the Rosy Bitterling compared to the zebrafish. Our study provides a foundation for future studies of the brain development in the Rosy Bitterling, a valuable model species for studying the evolutionary adaptations associated with brood parasitism.

Analysis of mitochondrial genomes in a Bayesian framework with the site heterogeneous CAT+GTR model resulted in a topology largely consistent with the current understanding of heterobranch phylogeny. However, mitochondrial genomes appear to be too variable to serve as good phylogenetic markers for robustly resolving a number of deeper splits within this clade.},

Results: In this work, we investigated the presence of caspase homologs using a combination of bioinformatics and phylogenetic analyses. We blasted the Crassostrea gigas genome for caspase homologs and identified thirty-five potential homologs in the addition to the already cloned twenty-three bivalve caspases. As such, we present information about the phylogenetic relationship of all identified bivalve caspases in relation to their homology to well-established vertebrate and invertebrate caspases. Our results reveal unexpected novelty and complexity in the bivalve caspase family. Notably, we were unable to identify direct homologues to the initiator caspase-9, a key-caspase in the vertebrate apoptotic pathway, inflammatory caspases (caspase-1,-4 or -5) or executioner caspases-3, -6, -7. We also explored the fact that bivalves appear to possess several unique homologs to the initiator caspase groups -2 and -8. Large expansions of caspase-3 like homologues (caspase-3A-C), caspase-3/7 group and caspase-3/7-like homologues were also identified, suggesting unusual roles of caspases with direct implications for our understanding of immune response in relation to common bivalve diseases. Furthermore, we assessed the gene expression of two initiator (Cg2A, Cg8B) and four executioner caspases (Cg3A, Cg3B, Cg3C, Cg3/7) in C. gigas late-larval development and during metamorphosis, indicating that caspase expressions vary across the different developmental stages.
Conclusion: Our analysis provides the first overview of caspases across different bivalve species with essential new insight into caspase diversity, knowledge that can be used for further investigations into response to pathogens or regulation of developmental processes.},

	abstract = {Background: Plastic is everywhere. It is used in food packaging, storage containers, electronics, furniture, clothing, and common single-use disposable items. Microplastic and nanoplastic particulates are formed from bulk fragmentation and disintegration of plastic pollution. Plastic particulates have recently been detected in indoor air and remote atmospheric fallout. Due to their small size, microplastic and nanoplastic particulate in the atmosphere can be inhaled and may pose a risk for human health, specifically in susceptible populations. When inhaled, nanosized particles have been shown to translocate across pulmonary cell barriers to secondary organs, including the placenta. However, the potential for maternal-to-fetal translocation of nanosized-plastic particles and the impact of nanoplastic deposition or accumulation on fetal health remain unknown. In this study we investigated whether nanopolystyrene particles can cross the placental barrier and deposit in fetal tissues after maternal pulmonary exposure.
Results: Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to 20 nm rhodamine-labeled nanopolystyrene beads (2.64 x 1014 particles) via intratracheal instillation on gestational day (GD) 19. Twenty-four hours later on GD 20, maternal and fetal tissues were evaluated using fluorescent optical imaging. Fetal tissues were fixed for particle visualization with hyperspectral microscopy. Using isolated placental perfusion, a known concentration of nanopolystyrene was injected into the uterine artery. Maternal and fetal effluents were collected for 180 minutes and assessed for polystyrene particle concentration. Twenty-four hours after maternal exposure, fetal and placental weights were significantly lower (7\% and 8\%, respectively) compared with controls. Nanopolystyrene particles were detected in the maternal lung, heart, and spleen. Polystyrene nanoparticles were also observed in the placenta, fetal liver, lungs, heart, kidney, and brain suggesting maternal lung-to-fetal tissue nanoparticle translocation in late stage pregnancy.
Conclusion: These studies confirm that maternal pulmonary exposure to nanopolystyrene results in the translocation of plastic particles to placental and fetal tissues and renders the fetoplacental unit vulnerable to adverse effects. These data are vital to the understanding of plastic particulate toxicology and the developmental origins of health and disease.},

We describe how the WAF approach is the only currently known method for testing the toxicity of the whole of a complex substance, even when some of its constituents remain unknown; it accounts for differences in the solubility of the constituents within a complex substance; and use of loading rates to describe any toxic effects is a unifying concept that allows direct comparison with releases of readily soluble substances in hazard assessment and chemical classification.},

interview with Norbert Bachleitner.



In this 200th volume of
Internationale Forschungen zur Allgemeinen und Vergleichenden Literaturwissenschaft the editors Norbert Bachleitner, Achim H. Hölter and John A. McCarthy 'take stock' of the discipline. It focuses on recurrent questions in the field of Comparative Literature: What is literature? What is meant by 'comparative'? Or by 'world'? What constitute 'transgressions' or 'refractions'? What, ultimately, does being at home in the world imply? When we combine the answers to these individual questions, we might ultimately reach an intriguing proposition: Comparative Literature contributes to a sense of being at home in a world that is heterogeneous and fractured, rather than affirming a monolithic canon marked by territory and homogeneity. The volume unites essays on world literature, literature in the context of the history of ideas, comparative women and gender studies, aesthetics and textual analysis, and literary translation and tradition.},

	abstract = {Mirrorlands is a journey through space and time to the meeting points of Russia and China, the world's largest and most populous countries. Charting an unconventional course southeast through Siberia, Inner Mongolia, the Russian Far East and Manchuria, anthropologist and linguist Ed Pulford sketches a rich series of encounters with people and places unknown not only to outsiders, but also to most residents of the capital cities where his journey begins and ends.What Russia and China have in common goes much deeper than their status as authoritarian post-socialist states or perceived menaces to Western hegemony. Their shared history can only fully be appreciated from an intimately local, borderland perspective. Along remote roads, rivers and railways, in cosmopolitan cities and indigenous villages of the northeast Asian frontiers, Pulford maps the strikingly similar ways in which these two vast empires have ruled their Eurasian domains, before, during and after socialism.With great cultural nuance, Mirrorlands thoughtfully evokes the diverse daily interactions between residents of the Russia-China borderlands, and their resulting visions of "Europe" and "Asia." It is a vivid portrait of centuries of cross-border encounter, mimicry and conflict, key to understanding the global place and identity of two leading world powers.},

	abstract = {An illustrated exploration of colors and patterns in the animal kingdom, what they communicate, and how they function in the social life of animals. 
Are animals able to appreciate what humans refer to as "beauty"? The term scarcely ever appears nowadays in a scientific description of living things, but we humans may nonetheless find the colors, patterns, and songs of animals to be beautiful in apparently the same way that we see beauty in works of art. In
Animal Beauty, Nobel Prize-winning biologist Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard describes how the colors and patterns displayed by animals arise, what they communicate, and how they function in the social life of animals. Watercolor drawings illustrate these amazing instances of animal beauty.
Darwin addressed the topic of ornament in his 1871 book
The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, and did not hesitate to engage with criteria of beauty, convinced that animals experienced color and ornament as attractive and agreeable in the same way that we do, and that the role this played in mate choice pointed to a "sexual selection" distinct from natural selection. Nüsslein-Volhard examines key examples of ornament and sexual selection in the animal kingdom and lays the groundwork for biological aesthetics. Noting that color patterns have not been a research priority--perhaps because they appeared to be nonessential luxuries rather than functional necessities--Nüsslein-Volhard looks at recent scientific developments on the topic. In part because of Nüsslein-Volhard's own research on the zebrafish, it is now possible to decipher the molecular genetic mechanisms that lead to production of colors in animal skin and its appendages and control its pattern and distribution.},

	abstract = {In Freedom's Progress?, Gerard Casey argues that the progress of freedom has largely consisted in an intermittent and imperfect transition from tribalism to individualism, from the primacy of the collective to the fragile centrality of the individual person and of freedom. Such a transition is, he argues, neither automatic nor complete, nor are relapses to tribalism impossible. The reason for the fragility of freedom is simple: the importance of individual freedom is simply not obvious to everyone. Most people want security in this world, not liberty. 'Libertarians,' writes Max Eastman, 'used to tell us that "the love of freedom is the strongest of political motives," but recent events have taught us the extravagance of this opinion. The "herd-instinct" and the yearning for paternal authority are often as strong. Indeed the tendency of men to gang up under a leader and submit to his will is of all political traits the best attested by history.' The charm of the collective exercises a perennial magnetic attraction for the human spirit. In the 20th century, Fascism, Bolshevism and National Socialism were, Casey argues, each of them a return to tribalism in one form or another and many aspects of our current Western welfare states continue to embody tribalist impulses.Thinkers you would expect to feature in a history of political thought feature in this book - Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Locke, Mill and Marx - but you will also find thinkers treated in Freedom's Progress? who don't usually show up in standard accounts - Johannes Althusius, Immanuel Kant, William Godwin, Max Stirner, Joseph Proudhon, Mikhail Bakunin, Pyotr Kropotkin, Josiah Warren, Benjamin Tucker and Auberon Herbert. Freedom's Progress? also contains discussions of the broader social and cultural contexts in which politics takes its place, with chapters on slavery, Christianity, the universities, cities, Feudalism, law, kingship, the Reformation, the English Revolution and what Casey calls Twentieth Century Tribalisms - Bolshevism, Fascism and National Socialism and an extensive chapter on human prehistory.},

	abstract = {Handbook of Cannabis and Related Pathologies: Biology, Pharmacology, Diagnosis, and Treatment is the first book to take an interdisciplinary approach to the understanding of cannabis use and misuse. Recent worldwide trends toward decriminalizing marijuana for medical use have increased legal use of the drug and recreational use remains high, making cannabis one of the most commonly used drugs. Cannabis has a wide range of adverse neurological effects, and use and abuse can lead to physical, social, and psychopathological issues that are multifarious and complex. Effective understanding and treatment requires knowledge of the drug's effects from across scientific disciplines. This book provides an overview of the biological and pharmacological components of the cannabis plant, outlines its neurological, social, and psychopathological effects, assists in the diagnosis and screening for use and dependency, and aids researchers in developing effective treatments for cannabis-related issues and disorders. Fully illustrated, with contributions from internationally recognized experts, it is the go-to resource for neuroscientists, pharmacologists, pathologists, public-health workers, and any other researcher who needs an in-depth and cross-disciplinary understanding of cannabis and its effects. Comprehensive chapters include an abstract, key facts, mini dictionary of terms, and summary points Presents illustrations with at least six figures, tables, and diagrams per chapter Provides a one-stop-shopping synopsis of everything to do with cannabis and its related pathology, from chemicals and cells, individuals and communities, and diagnosis and treatment Offers an integrated and informed synopsis of the complex issues surrounding cannabis as a substance, its use, and its misuse},

Martin, coeditor of The Bioarchaeology of Violence"Amply demonstrates the breadth and variability of the impact of colonialism."--Ken Nystrom, State University of New York at New Paltz European expansion into the New World fundamentally altered indigenous populations. The collision between East and West led to the most recent human adaptive transition that spread around the world. Paradoxically, these are some of the least scientifically understood processes of the human past. Representing a new generation of contact and colonialism studies, this volume expands on the traditional focus on the health of conquered peoples by considering how extraordinary biological and cultural transformations were incorporated into the human body and reflected in behavior, identity, and adaptation. By examining changes in diet, mortuary practices, and diseases, these globally diverse case studies demonstrate that the effects of conquest reach further than was ever thought before--to both the colonized and the colonizers. People on all sides of colonial contact became entangled in cultural and biological transformations of social identities, foodways, social structures, and gene pools at points of contact and beyond. Contributors to this volume illustrate previously unknown and variable effects of colonialism by analyzing skeletal remains and burial patterns from never-before-studied regions in the Americas to the Middle East, Africa, and Europe. The result is the first step toward a new synthesis of archaeology and bioarchaeology. Melissa S.

A distinguished group of 31 expert authors has contributed 25 chapters as a tribute to Enid Gilbert-Barness and the late Lewis Barness--- both pioneers in this topic. Enid's unique perspectives on the pathology of genetic disorders and Lew's unsurpassed knowledge of metabolism integrated with nutrition have inspired the contributors to write interdisciplinary descriptions of generally rare, and always challenging, hereditary metabolic disorders. Discussions of these interesting genetic disorders are organized in the perspective of molecular abnormalities leading to morphologic disturbances with distinct pathology and clinical manifestations.The book emphasizes recent advances such as development of improved diagnostic methods and discovery of new, more effective therapies for many of the diseases. It includes optimal strategies for diagnosis and information on access to specialized laboratories for specific testing. The target audience is a wide variety of clinicians, including pediatricians, neonatologists, obstetricians, maternal-fetal specialists, internists, pathologists, geneticists, and laboratorians engaged in prenatal and/or neonatal screening. In addition, all scientists and health science professionals interested in metabolic diseases will find the comprehensive, integrated chapters informative on the latest discoveries. It is our hope that the 2nd Edition will open new avenues and vistas for our readers and that they will share with us the interest, excitement and passion of the research into all these challenging disorders.},

	abstract = {In the dying days of the eighth century, the Vikings erupted onto the international stage with brutal raids and slaughter. The medieval Norsemen may be best remembered as monk murderers and village pillagers, but this is far from the whole story. Throughout the Middle Ages, long-ships transported hairy northern voyagers far and wide, where they not only raided but also traded, explored and settled new lands, encountered unfamiliar races, and embarked on pilgrimagesand crusades.The Norsemen travelled to all corners of the medieval world and beyond; north to the wastelands of arctic Scandinavia, south to the politically turbulent heartlands of medieval Christendom, west across the wild seas to Greenland and the fringes of the North American continent, and east down the Russian waterways trading silver, skins, and slaves. Beyond the Northlands explores this world through the stories that the Vikings told about themselves in their sagas.But the depiction of the Viking world in the Old Norse-Icelandic sagas goes far beyond historical facts. What emerges from these tales is a mixture of realism and fantasy, quasi-historical adventures, and exotic wonder-tales that rocket far beyond the horizon of reality. On the crackling brown pages of saga manuscripts, trolls, dragons, and outlandish tribes jostle for position with explorers, traders, and kings.To explore the sagas and the world that produced them, Eleanor Rosamund Barraclough now takes her own trip through the dramatic landscapes that they describe. Along the way, she illuminates the rich but often confusing saga accounts with a range of other evidence: archaeological finds, rune-stones, medieval world maps, encyclopaedic manuscripts, and texts from as far away as Byzantium and Baghdad. As her journey across the Old Norse world shows, by situating the sagas against the revealingbackground of this other evidence, we can begin at least to understand just how the world was experienced, remembered, and imagined by this unique culture from the outermost edge of Europe so many centuries ago.},

The same case study is used for both methods to provide a clear illustration of differences and similarities, and deliberative coverage breaks down the jargon and technical language to facilitate a deeper level of understanding.
Like all volumes in the
Essentials of Psychological Assessment series, this book is designed to help busy practitioners quickly acquire the knowledge they need to conduct accurate, informative assessments. Key points are highlighted throughout to allow for quick reference as needed, and coverage of the latest research provides up-to-date perspective in line with leaders in the field. Downloadable resources including sample forms, checklists, and charts assist in all phases of the assessment, and help clinicians transition cleanly between the Comprehensive System and the R-PAS.
The Rorschach Inkblot Test assesses unconscious perceptions, thought processes, needs, motivations, and conflicts; the Comprehensive System has a well-established track record, but new evidence shows that the more recent R-PAS method may be advantageous in some situations.
Essentials of Rorschach Assessment: Comprehensive System and R-PAS offers practical guidance and comparative examination to quickly bring clinicians up to speed.

She spends a lot of time fishing chickens out of her bathtub and Parsnip out of the chicken run. In between, she stares into space a lot looking for inspiration for her stories. Meanwhile, her glamorous and exciting double works as a gastro-detective whose headquarters are the famous Bodleian Library in Oxford; she spends her time there pondering which sandwich filling she would prefer for lunch when she is not hot on the trail of a famous gastronome. The Dining with Destiny series is the result of just such weighty thoughts - oh, and a short-term memory problem which means that Fiona can never recall anything important like the date of a war or how to hoover, but can always be counted upon to remember how much jam Marx liked on his tarts. Time will tell which is the more important.},

	abstract = {Lake Winnipeg is also central to Manitoba's economy through commercial fishing and tourism. In keeping with the current federal government's recognition that the environment and economy are inseparable, the Lake Winnipeg Foundation, in its Lake Winnipeg health plan, has advocated for investment in a clean-water economy.              Both Lake Winnipeg and the Bay have the potential to establish the city and province as leaders in sustainability. A comprehensive action plan for the Lake Winnipeg watershed would enable integration of climate change, water quality and quantity initiatives. Restoration of the Bay would enable integration of environmental, economic and social-sustainability initiatives to revitalize Winnipeg's downtown core. Investment in both Lake Winnipeg and the Bay would contribute to the provincial economy.              The biennial convention provides an opportunity for Manitoba to speak to Canadian neighbours and citizens about a vision for Canada in a Manitoba context. This is a call for delegates to support the Lake Winnipeg resolution and development of an action plan in the form of nutrient targets and freshwater-management strategy for Lake Winnipeg and its watershed, and to encourage non-Manitoban delegates to witness the majesty of the Bay building at the corner of Portage and Memorial and its potential to revitalize downtown as a cultural, social and environmental hub.},

Recognizing that the creation of true wit is a subjective endeavour, Richler suggests that the commission of language wit occurs not only wittingly, but also unwittingly and sometimes even half-wittedly. When we consciously manipulate language for the purpose of wit, Richler designates this process "arranged wit," and because sometimes the humour seemingly emanates from the mind of a nitwit rather than a wit, Richler designates this "deranged wit." Moreover, what appears to be deranged can actually be artfully arranged, or as Polonius might say, there is much method to the madness. Join Richler in Wordplay as he highlights the most whimsical English language writers throughout the ages and analyzes what constitutes both arranged and deranged wit.

	abstract = {Over the decades, research has demonstrated that in categories of life deemed to be important, beautiful people achieve more desirable outcomes, are judged more favorably, and receive preferential treatment. An understanding of the historical aspects, science, and implications of what the human mind finds aesthetically pleasing is quintessential for dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and others who practice aesthetic medicine as the importance of beauty in today's society is what brings patients into clinics. 
While an element of dissatisfaction with one's appearance is commonplace, clinicians should remain vigilant for individuals who seek cosmetic procedures to quell excessive body image concerns that are out of proportion to objective physical findings. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a disorder of self-perception; it is the impairing preoccupation with a nonexistent or minimal flaw in appearance. According to recent statistics, BDD occurs in 0.7-2.4\% of the general population; however, multiple studies have suggested an incidence of 6-16\% in patients seeking aesthetic medical treatments. Moreover, a vast majority will at some point seek dermatologic treatment and cosmetic surgery. Such patients are unlikely to be satisfied with corrective procedures, and only 15\% of dermatologists surveyed thought that they could successfully treat BDD. Therefore,
Beauty and Body Dysmor phic Disorder aims to assist dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and other aesthetic providers in recognizing key characteristics as well as providing treatment strategies to help in caring for those with BDD.
Discusses body dysmophic disorder as it relates to the objective and subjective aspects of beauty
Provides dermatologists with information that will help them treat those afflicted with body dysmorphia
Discusses how to spot the signs in current and potential patients
Topics covered include the historical importance of beauty, body image and body image dissatisfaction, case studies, etiology of body dysmorphic disorder, and therapeutic interventions

In Human Rights and Human Wrongs, Colin Tatz - a world authority on racial conflict and abuse, a key figure in Indigenous Studies in Australia, and an author of major works on genocide, Aboriginal youth suicide, and Aboriginal and Islander sporting achievements - tells his personal story. Born and educated in South Africa, Tatz worked to expose and oppose that nation's centuries-old apartheid regimes before leaving for what he thought would be a more enlightened nation, only to find in Australia striking parallels of that other dismal universe. As a researcher, writer, and activist, he has dedicated his life to confronting what people do to other's on the basis of their race or ethnicity, yet he also relates here how alienation, how his Jewishness, and how an intriguing problem with food have been propelling forces for him. Colin Tatz's story - ranging from Southern Africa to Australia, as well as New Zealand, Canada, and Israel - is an important one for all who are genuinely interested in the struggle to achieve social justice for minorities and marginalized peoples. *** "This book successfully engages the reader in the author's engrossing and complex journey from childhood and his lifelong struggles against racism. The narrative touches upon extreme examples of that struggle in the twentieth century. It is scholarly, deeply personal and infused with humanism, warmth and humour." - Dr. Ross Mellick, +61J, May 2015 (Series: Biography) [Subject: Autobiography, History, Australian Studies, Jewish Studies, Racial Studies, Human Rights]},

	abstract = {Assessing and monitoring water quality status through timely, cost effective and accurate manner is of fundamental importance for numerous environmental management and policy making purposes. Therefore, there is a current need for validated methodologies which can effectively exploit, in an unsupervised way, the enormous amount of earth observation imaging datasets from various high-resolution satellite multispectral sensors. To this end, many research efforts are based on building concrete relationships and empirical algorithms from concurrent satellite and in-situ data collection campaigns. We have experimented with Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 multi-temporal satellite data, coupled with hyperspectral data from a field spectroradiometer and in-situ ground truth data with several physico-chemical and other key monitoring indicators. All available datasets, covering a 4 years period, in our case study Lake Karla in Greece, were processed and fused under a quantitative evaluation framework. The performed comprehensive analysis posed certain questions regarding the applicability of single empirical models across multi-temporal, multi-sensor datasets towards the accurate prediction of key water quality indicators for shallow inland systems. Single linear regression models didn't establish concrete relations across multi-temporal, multi-sensor observations. Moreover, the shallower parts of the inland system followed, in accordance with the literature, different regression patterns. Landsat 7 and 8 resulted in quite promising results indicating that from the recreation of the lake and onward consistent per-sensor, per-depth prediction models can be successfully established. The highest rates were for chl-a (r$^{\textrm{2}}$=89.80\%), dissolved oxygen (r$^{\textrm{2}}$=88.53\%), conductivity (r$^{\textrm{2}}$=88.18\%), ammonium (r$^{\textrm{2}}$=87.2\%) and pH (r$^{\textrm{2}}$=86.35\%), while the total phosphorus (r$^{\textrm{2}}$=70.55\%) and nitrates (r$^{\textrm{2}}$=55.50\%) resulted in lower correlation rates.},

This second edition follows on from the success of the first, updating the scientific research, covering recent findings in genetics and the mind/body connection, and including a new chapter highlighting our growing understanding of the part also played by pregnancy in shaping a baby's future emotional and physical well-being. The author focuses in particular on the wide-ranging effects of early stress on a baby or toddler's developing nervous system. When things go wrong with relationships in early life, the dependent child has to adapt; what we now know is that his or her brain adapts too. The brain's emotion and immune systems are particularly affected by early stress and can become less effective. This makes the child more vulnerable to a range of later difficulties such as depression, anti-social behaviour, addictions or anorexia, as well as physical illness.},

	abstract = {'This is a magnificently inventive and exciting story. I was hooked as soon as I began to read it. Richard Kluft is a truly gifted storyteller, and he has the specialized training and knowledge to tell this frightening tale with the authenticity it deserves. In many ways, this novel, based in part on real science and real events, is a modern-day Frankenstein, where beneficial scientific advances become perverted into harmful weapons. Here, the survival of our most precious possession - the sanctity of our own mind - hangs in the balance. Kluft captures the essence of man's struggle against covert psychological oppression, and his ultimate triumph over its soul-murdering tyranny. Good Shrink/Bad Shrink is more than just a ripping good yarn; it is a cautionary tale that freedom of thought faces increasingly more dangerous enemies. I can already visualize Good Shrink/Bad Shrink on the silver screen.'- Alan W. Scheflin, JD, LLM, MA, Professor, Santa Clara University School of Law, co-author of The Mind Manipulators, and Memory, Trauma Treatment, and the Law'Drawing on his life-long expertise in hypnotherapy, Richard Kluft cleverly fashions a clandestine misuse of hypnosis into a racy novel. A sardonic campus scenario swiftly morphs into a page-turning action-thriller, so engaging that even Tarantino might be hooked. Surely Hollywood beckons! The mind-bending conceits place Clockwork Orange firmly in the shade. This is a long, impossible-to-put-down read..'- John Gruzelier, Emeritus Professor of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London'Richard Kluft has written a profound tour de force mystery that is simultaneously gripping and educational. He is a respected master clinician and researcher, as well as a gifted mystery writer. Not only is Good Shrink/Bad Shrink hard to put down, but it also opens up a new world about the uses and misuses of standard psychological treatments. It is engrossing both because of the power of its gripping narrative and for what we inevitably learn about the inner workings of people, both good and bad. Kluft immerses us in both, simultaneously and relentlessly, in this exciting book.'- Gerald Adler, MD, Training and Supervising Analyst, Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute; author of Borderline Psychopathology and Its Treatment'Richard Kluft takes us on a wild ride with fast-paced dialogue, thrilling action, and exhilarating ideas. Good Shrink/Bad Shrink transports us to a world of super scientists, super soldiers, and super spies, making us question everything and everyone. Who is the good shrink, and who the bad? Who truly understands the patient? And who will be the good feds, the fake feds, and ultimately the dead feds? In a world of intrigue and mind control, who can really be sure of anything?'- Jill Savege Scharff, MD, co-founder of the International Psychotherapy Institute and Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Georgetown University, Washington DC},

It is a scientific revolution built upon the tools of molecular biology, with which we probe and prod the living world in ways unimaginable a few decades ago. Need to track a bacterium at the root of a hospital outbreak? No problem: the offending germ's complete genetic profile can be obtained in 24 hours. We insert human DNA into E. coli bacteria to produce our insulin. It is natural to look at biotechnology in the 21st century with a mix of wonder and fear. But biotechnology is not as 'unnatural' as one might think. All living organisms use the same molecular processes to replicate their genetic material and the same basic code to 'read' their genes. The similarities can be seen in their DNA. Here, John Archibald shows how evolution has been 'plugging-and-playing' with the subcellular components of life from the very beginning and continues to do so today.For evidence, we need look no further than the inner workings of our own cells. Molecular biology has allowed us to gaze back more than three billion years, revealing the microbial mergers and acquisitions that underpin the development of complex life.

	abstract = {Due to anthropogenic activities, freshwater systems worldwide are exposed to thousands of compounds. Monitoring of priority pollutants is important, however, monitoring of all individual compounds would be practically impossible. Moreover, the effects on human health remains mostly unknown since compound toxicity data is often absent. With the release of increasing amounts of new (emerging) chemicals into the environment, new monitoring strategies are required to assess the effects of (drinking water relevant) chemicals on human health. Therefore, sensitive in-vitro bioassays have been developed which focus on specific physiological effects such as endocrine disruption or mutagenicity. The advantages of bioassays are that they directly determine the effect of (an entire mixture of) compounds present in an environmental sample instead of identifying single compounds. These bioassays are able to detect known and unknown compounds as long as they trigger the bioassay response. However, a disadvantage of applying these assays may be that they each focus on a (relatively narrow selection of) specific physiological endpoint and that the human relevance is often obscure.The evolution of new technologies and the recent advances in the knowledge on DNA sequences and organisation (i.e. genomics) have enabled the development of new holistic tools, such as DNA microarrays. This report provides an overview of innovative omic methods and the mechanisms behind certain genomics technologies are explained. The main focus is on the potential application of DNA microarrays that are able to measure the impact of toxic substances on gene expression, i.e. transcription of DNA to mRNA (transcriptomics). Practical information on this method, such as sensitivity, analysis time, responsiveness, specificity, etc. is discussed. An overview is presented of the potential applications of this technology with regard to water quality assessment. In addition, the limitations and challenges that need to be overcome are discussed. The following potential applications for genomics in water quality assessment are foreseen: Prediction of the toxicity of compounds that are newly detected in aquatic samples and of which possible toxic properties and MOA are unknown.Environmental monitoring of toxic pressure at locations relevant for the water sector, such as drinking water intake locations. For this purpose, the No Observed Transcriptional Level (NOTEL) concept is a helpful concept to mutually compare different sites. Pre-screening of chemicals or locations for relevant toxicological effects, which can be investigated in more depth with specific bioassays.},

	abstract = {Interdisciplinary perspectives on the feature of conscious life that scaffolds every act of cognition: subjective time. 
Our awareness of time and temporal properties is a constant feature of conscious life. Subjective temporality structures and guides every aspect of behavior and cognition, distinguishing memory, perception, and anticipation. This milestone volume brings together research on temporality from leading scholars in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, defining a new field of interdisciplinary research.
The book's thirty chapters include selections from classic texts by William James and Edmund Husserl and new essays setting them in historical context; contemporary philosophical accounts of lived time; and current empirical studies of psychological time. These last chapters, the larger part of the book, cover such topics as the basic psychophysics of psychological time, its neural foundations, its interaction with the body, and its distortion in illness and altered states of consciousness.

Grounded, internationally renowned CEO advisor Bob Rosen proposes a new approach to leadership that speaks to our better selves and is designed for any leader who grapples with the unrelenting and complex demands of today's marketplace. Rosen argues that leaders at every level can become more self-aware, develop their untapped potential, and drive significantly better results--for themselves, their teams, and their organizations. This groundbreaking approach is drawn from Rosen's Healthy Leader model and highlights the six personal dimensions that fuel--and refuel--the world's top leaders: physical, emotional, intellectual, social, vocational, and spiritual health.

Grounded is based on long-term research with hundreds of CEOs and leaders from around the world, and includes illustrative stories from a variety of organizations, including the Fire Department of New York, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Lego Group, Ralph Lauren, and Medstar Health.
Now any leader can master the six dimensions needed to develop the stamina and strength to not only weather tough times but to achieve exceptional results.

Grounded is based on long-term research with hundreds of CEOs and leaders from around the world, and includes illustrative stories from a variety of organizations, including the Fire Department of New York, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Lego Group, Ralph Lauren, and Medstar Health.
Now any leader can master the six dimensions needed to develop the stamina and strength to not only weather tough times but to achieve exceptional results.

BOB ROSEN is a trusted CEO advisor, organizational psychologist, and bestselling author. As the founder and CEO of Healthy Companies International, he has long been on a mission to transform the world of business, one leader at a time. The recipient of a multiyear grant from the MacArthur Foundation, Bob continues to pursue his research into the nature of leadership. A frequent media commentator, he has been featured in the
New York Times, the
Wall Street Journal, Fortune, and the

And can this resilience be taught? During the past decade, exciting scientific advances have shed light on how resilience operates from neurons to neighborhoods. In The Resilience Handbook, experts in the science of resilience draw on human and animal research to describe the process of resilience and follow its course as it unfolds both within individuals and in social networks. Contributors also highlight the promise of new interventions that apply what we know about resilience processes to bolster positive health, and raise some of the pressing questions and issues for the field as it matures. This handbook is designed to be used by students as an invitation to a burgeoning field; by researchers, as a framework for advancing theories, hypotheses, and empirical tests of resilience functions; and by clinicians, as a comprehensive and up-to-the-minute integration of theory and practice.},

Humor in Romance Language Literatures is the selective product of a multi-national gathering of scholars sponsored by Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, to explore humor across the centuries in the literatures of Italy, France, Romania, the Iberian Peninsula and its diaspora. The volume contains thirty-one scholarly and interpretative papers on diverse aspects of their wit, provocative aspects that are, for the most part, little known to the general reader. Precisely because of its scope and diversity, its appeal should extend beyond academia into the libraries of the intellectually curious, be they English speakers or not, be they specialists in humanities, psychology, society and culture, or merely interested amateurs who frequent the many new humor societies and clubs that abound in the world of today.},

This new edition incorporates the tremendous amount of research that has come to light since the first edition was published. From a physical perspective, the text examines age-related changes and disease-related processes, the demography of the aging population, aging theories, and how to promote optimal aging. Coverage of the psychosocial aspects of aging encompasses mental health, stress and coping, spirituality, and caregiving in later years.The authors address demographic, theoretical, and methodological issues on aging, including a worldwide overview of aging demographics. The book reviews biological and psychosocial theories and offers much-needed information on longitudinal design and statistics as they relate to aging research. It discusses the aging of the major organ systems, the brain and sensory systems, and the endocrine and immune systems; basic anatomy and physiology; normal, impaired, and optimal aging; and functional health. Psychosocial factors that affect health are addressed, including the interplay between physical health and mental health, stress, coping, and social support. The text also covers current issues in social gerontology, including such promising new trends as gerontechnology and Green Houses, and provides information on health promotion programs.New to the Second Edition: Information involving retirement, volunteer opportunities, housing, and adaptation to health changesCoverage of economics and aging, including information on social security and other retirement income and the future of Medicare and MedicaidSignificant new information about the regulatory systemsRevised and updated chapters on death and dying and optimal agingDiscussions on two models of optimal aging and valuable tips for its promotionURLs to relevant websites for additional informatio},

	abstract = {Told in unflinching detail, this is the story of the Twenty-Ninth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, also known as the Giddings Regiment or the Abolition Regiment, after its founder, radical abolitionist Congressman J. R. Giddings. The men who enlisted in the Twenty-Ninth OVI were, according to its lore, handpicked to ensure each was as pure in his antislavery beliefs as its founder. Whether these soldiers would fight harder than other soldiers, and whether the people of their hometowns would remain devoted to the ideals of the regiment, were questions that could only be tested by the experiment of war.The Untried Life is the story of these men from their very first regimental formation in a county fairground to the devastation of Gettysburg and the march to Atlanta and back again, enduring disease and Confederate prisons. It brings to vivid life the comradeship and loneliness that pervaded their days on the march. Dozens of unforgettable characters emerge, animated by their own letters and diaries: Corporal Nathan Parmenter, whose modest upbringing belies the eloquence of his writings; Colonel Lewis Buckley, one of the Twenty-Ninth's most charismatic officers; and Chaplain Lyman Ames, whose care of the sick and wounded challenged his spiritual beliefs. The Untried Life shows how the common soldier lived-his entertainments, methods of cooking, medical treatment, and struggle to maintain family connections-and separates the facts from the mythology created in the decades after the war."},

	abstract = {A novel proposal that the cognitive architecture for volition and cognition arises from particular kinds of social interaction and communication. 
In
Open Minds, Wolfgang Prinz offers the novel claim that agency and intentionality are first perceived and understood in others, and that it is only through practices and discourses of social mirroring that individuals come to apply these features to themselves and to shape their architectures for volition and cognition accordingly. Developing a (social science) constructive approach within a (cognitive science) representational framework, Prinz argues that the architectures for agency (volition) and intentionality (cognition) arise from particular kinds of social interaction and communication. Rather than working as closed, individual systems, our minds operate in ways that are fundamentally open to other minds.
Prinz describes mirror systems and mirror games, particular kinds of representational mechanisms and social games that provide tools for aligning closed individual minds with other minds. He maps the formation of an architecture for volition, addressing issues of agency and intention-based top-down control, then outlines the ways the same basic ideas can be applied to an architecture for cognition, helping to solve basic issues of subjectivity and intentionality.
Addressing the reality and efficacy of such social artifacts as autonomy and free will, Prinz contends that our beliefs about minds are not just beliefs about their workings but powerful tools for making them work as we believe. It is through our beliefs that our minds work in a particular way that we actually make them work in that way.},

H. Michelle Grandin currently works as a scientific writer and consultant in the field of tissue regeneration and implant surfaces for dental applications. Previously, she worked as a senior research scientist in the biointerface group of Marcus Textor at ETH Zurich. There, she developed a waveguide fluorescence microscope for the study of bio-interactions in the near-field as well as leading a group in the development of 3D single cellular microwell arrays for application in stem cell and cancer research.

Marcus Textor is a Professor Emeritus at ETH Zurich, Department of Materials. He was head of a research group dedicated to surfaces and interfaces in bio-related fields of material science. His research interests cover both fundamental aspects of the behavior of materials in contact with biological milieus and the design and development of surfaces that elicit biospecific responses.},

	abstract = {In fact, it shows what [Louis Helbig] estimates using Google Earth to be a 15-acre (6-hectare) corner, or about 3 per cent, of the largest of three piles of sulfur extracted by Syndcrude's Mildred Lake upgrader in the Alberta tarsands. In all, these stockpiles, configured like step pyramids, cover some 903 acres, (about 366 hectares), a graphic reminder of the bitumen's high sulfur content. Also at Mildred Lake are tailing ponds, including one held in place by what is considered the largest embankment dam in the world.              "I've learned that the imagery can engage," he says. And engagement, Helbig believes, is needed for the nation to grapple with the complex tarsands issue.              Photographer Louis Helbig displayed one of his images of Syncrude's Mildred Lake operations in the Alberta tarsands at the IDS. The remnants of the lost village of Aultsville, Ont., which was flooded by the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1958, can be seen clearly from the air.

Each chapter, and the volume as a whole, offers closer and richer consideration of the issues, practices and structures of multiple mobilities which shape the current world but which have typically been overlooked or minimised. What this approach seeks to do is not only draw attention to many new areas of research and investigation relating to mobile lives, but also to point to new theories and methods by which such lives have to be researched and examined. Such new theories and methods are relevant both to rethinking 'transport' studies as such but are also recasting 'societal' studies as 'transport' so that it comes out of the ghetto and enters mainstream social science.},

	abstract = {The thoroughly updated Fifth Edition of Pediatric Neuroimaging is a highly illustrated text-reference that describes and illustrates the full range of pediatric disorders diagnosable by modern neuroimaging. Covering the diagnosis of brain, spinal, and head and neck disorders in the pediatric patient, the text is rooted in the principle that the proper interpretation of studies requires the acquisition of high-quality images and an understanding of the basic concepts of neuroembryology, normal development, and pathophysiology. Much coverage is given to the disorders seen in everyday practice. The emphasis is on CT and MRI, which are the optimal imaging modalities in children.The first two chapters describe useful imaging techniques in this patient population and the imaging manifestations of normal development, to distinguish that from manifestations of disease. The final ten chapters of the book are divided by groups of diseases, with numerous drawings and images that illuminate the underlying pathologic and embryologic/genetic bases of each disorder. The goal is provide a basic approach to groups of diseases, then offer detailed information about the clinical manifestations, underlying biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics and/or pathology of specific disorders.The book incorporates the essential concepts for obtaining good images and understanding normal development, which helps the reader to distinguish normal developmental changes from disease.},

	abstract = {This major new collection of texts by HÃ©lÃ¨ne Cixous brings together a range of important untranslated as well as four previously unpublished essays. These essays deal with literature, politics, history, Algeria, and the university and include works from Cixous' most significant contributions to literary criticism (Joyce, Kleist, Stendhal, Kafka, Shakespeare) as well as her contemporary writing on human rights and geo-politics. They are all informed by Cixous' unique gift for combining a writer's love of idiom and life with a scholar's acute deconstructive reading. These texts present an extended account of what Cixous calls here 'autobibliography' in which writing, theory, politics and life combine to open up the world through critical reading and self-reflection. 'I am on the side of life', says Cixous. These essays affirm Cixous' reputation as one of our greatest readers and sources of critical light in the world today.Key Features*Author is a leading French theorist and writer*Essays cover a wide range of topics and contemporary issues},

This is a skillful blend of science, history and imagination which adds a chapter to the history of man's ingenuity, from Central Asia to Greece, to Egypt. Many texts, sites, and pictures will never seem quite the same again, after this very thorough and very lively scholarly excursion into a disregarded source of myth-making."

	abstract = {Fernand Braudel famously observed that the 'mere smell of cooking can evoke a whole civilization'. The way that food is prepared, served, and eaten reveals a great deal about the structure and workings of any society. It is therefore not surprising that food, and the culturally specific etiquettes and equipment that surround the act of eating have been studied by scholars from a wide range of disciplines. The papers in this volume consider the changes that occurred in Old and New World dining and related culinary activities between the 17th century and the early 20th century. This period saw the widespread acceptance of the fork in dining and the adoption of routinized etiquettes to govern eating. In the 18th century the rise of individualism ushered in new forms of segmented dining based upon symmetrically arranged tables and individual place settings. Against this backdrop of manufactured uniformity, made possible by advances in industrial production, highly stylized dining rituals and haute cuisine, which had previously been the exclusive domain of European courtly elites, entered the homes and routines of the 'middling sort'. Henceforth, material expressions of status and social identity became commonplace at the table, and an integral part of dining in all but the humblest homes. The unique contribution of this volume lies in the way in which a distinguished group of international historical archaeologists have combined the richness of primary archaeological evidence with a wealth of documentary evidence to create insightful new material histories of dining. The new light which this throws upon manufacturing processes, feasting rituals, the rise of respectability, the inter-continental spread of the Victorian cult of domesticity, and foodways among peripheral agricultural communities will be of interest to scholars beyond archaeology, in the cognate fields of anthropology, social and economic history, cultural geography, and material culture studies.},

	abstract = {Danilo Corradini is research director at the Institute of Chemical Methodologies of the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and a member of the General Scientific Advisory Board of CNR. His involvement in separation science started in 1976 with his research work on chromatography and electrophoresis for his PhD studies in chemistry, which was carried out at Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, under the direction of Michael Lederer, founder and first editor of the Journal of Chromatography. In 1983-1984, he worked with Csaba Horvath, the pioneer of HPLC, at the Department of Chemical Engineering at Yale University, New Haven (USA), where he initiated his first investigations on the HPLC of proteins and peptides. He continued this at the Institute of Chromatography of CNR after he returned to Italy. Currently, he is the head of the chromatography and capillary electrophoresis research unit of the Institute of Chemical Methodologies in Montelibretti, Rome. His research interests are focused on the theoretical and practical aspects of HPLC and capillary electromigration techniques for analytical scale separations of biopolymers, low molecular mass metabolites, and phytochemicals. 
He has extensively published in international scientific journals, has been chairman and invited speaker in national and international congresses and meetings, and serves on the editorial boards of several journals. He is the chairman of the Interdivisional Group of Separation Science of the Italian Chemical Society and a member of the International Advisory Board of the Mediterranean Separation Science Foundation Research and Training Center in Messina, Italy. In 2009 the Hungarian Separation Science Society assigned him the Csaba Horvath Memorial Award in recognition of his significant contribution to the development, understanding, and propagation of capillary electrophoresis throughout the world and his involvement in the development of separation s},

	abstract = {Social psychology is a flourishing discipline. It explores the most essential questions of the human psyche (e.g., Why do people help or harm others? How do influence professionals get us to do what they want, and how can we inoculate ourselves against their sometimes-insidious persuasion tactics? Why do social relationships exert such powerful effects on people's physical health?), and it does so with clever, ingenuitive research methods.This edited volume is a textbook for advanced social psychology courses. Its primary target audience is first-year graduate students (MA or PhD) in social psychlogy, although it is also appropriate for upper-level undergraduate courses in social psychology and for doctoral students in disciplines connecting to social psychology (e.g., marketing, organizational behavior). The authors of the chapters are world-renowned leaders on their topic, and they have written these chapters to be engaging and accessible to students who are just learning the discipline.After reading this book, you will be able to understand almost any journal article or conference presentation in any field of social psychology. You will be able to converse competently with most social psychologists in their primary research domain, a use skill that is relevant not only in daily life but also when interviewing for a faculty position. And, most importantly, you will be equipped with the background knowledge to forge ahead more confidently with your own research.},

Whether a bed is shared with a book, a child, a pet or a partner, whether lovers lie in ecstasy or indifference, whether bed relates to intimacy or betrayal, it is memories and recollections of bed, in whatever form, which have triggered the writing of these thirty stories by women from southern Africa. Well known writers Joanne Fedler, Sarah Lotz, Arja Salafranca, Rosemund Handler and Liesl Jobson will delight, but you will discover here new writers from Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Malawi, Namibia and Zambia, each with a unique voice as they cast light on the intimate lives of women living in this part of the world and the possibilities that are both available to and denied them. The BED BOOK of short stories some quirky and tender, others traumatic or macabre is the perfect companion to take to bed with you, to keep you reading long into the night."},

In Windhoek she develops friendships with a group of strong, independent women, who have also come from other countries, and are engaged in different ways to overcome the divisions of the past. Over coffee, drinks and food, they support each other through times of happiness and sadness, through juggling careers and family, and through illness and death. When her husband is made Ambassador to the Benelux countries and the European Union, and later Berlin, Jane has to build a new identity as the wife of an ambassador, and come to terms with her own ill-health without her friends around her to support her. Set against the backdrop of the historical, political and social development of newly independent Namibia, Undisciplined Heart tells the story of Jane s love for her family, friends and her adopted country, in a gentle and honest way that reflects the joys and tragedies of life"},

--The Gerontologist
"This is a must-read book for clinicians, service providers, policy makers, program planners, and teachers in the fields of mental health, aging, and emergency preparedness."From the Foreword by Robert N. Butler, MD
This book provides a comprehensive overview of the essential information that everyone working, or hoping to work in the field of aging, should know about disasters, emergencies, and their effects on the mental health and well-being of older persons. It provides the reader with evidence-based approaches for identifying and classifying mental health problems, such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, and substance use disorders in older adults, which may occur during and post disasters/emergencies.
Specific attention is given to the special needs and approaches to the care of at-risk groups of older persons such as veterans and holocaust survivors; older adults who are isolated, dependent, have mobility problems, communication deficits, are cognitively impaired, or have other co-morbidities; elders who use meals-on-wheels, vital medications, or home care; or older persons who are in senior centers, nursing homes, or assisted living settings.
Key Features

Increases understanding of the mental health issues in older adults
Provides tools that can foster resiliency and recovery at the community, group, and individual levels
Influences the development of positive responses to disasters that can potentially minimize adverse mental and physical outcomes in older persons and maximize individual and group recovery},

	abstract = {Arguments over the developmental origins of human knowledge are ancient, founded in the writings of Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Hume, and Kant. They have also persisted long enough to become a core area of inquiry in cognitive and developmental science. Empirical contributions to these debates, however, appeared only in the last century, when Jean Piaget offered the first viable theory of knowledge acquisition that centered on the great themes discussed by Kant: object, space, time, and causality. The essence of Piaget's theory is constructivism: The building of concepts from simpler perceptual and cognitive precursors, in particular from experience gained through manual behaviors and observation. The constructivist view was disputed by a generation of researchers dedicated to the idea of the competent infant, endowed with knowledge (say, of permanent objects) that emerged prior to facile manual behaviors. Taking this possibility further, it has been proposed that many fundamental cognitive mechanisms -- reasoning, event prediction, decision-making, hypothesis testing, and deduction -- operate independently of all experience, and are, in this sense, innate. The competent-infant view has an intuitive appeal, attested to by its widespread popularity, and it enjoys a kind of parsimony: It avoids the supposed philosophical pitfall posed by having to account for novel forms of knowledge in inductive learners. But this view leaves unaddressed a vital challenge: to understand the mechanisms by which new knowledge arises. This challenge has now been met. The neoconstructivist approach is rooted in Piaget's constructivist emphasis on developmental mechanisms, yet also reflects modern advances in our understanding of learning mechanisms, cortical development, and modeling. This book brings together, for the first time, theoretical views that embrace computational models and developmental neurobiology, and emphasize the interplay of time, experience, and cortical architecture to explain emergent knowledge, with an empirical line of research identifying a set of general-purpose sensory, perceptual, and learning mechanisms that guide knowledge acquisition across different domains and through development.},

	abstract = {Taking up the challenge of redefining modernity from a Caribbean perspective instead of assuming that the North Atlantic view of modernity is universal, Maria Cristina Fumagalli shows how the Caribbean's contributions to the modern world not only provide a more accurate account of the past but also have the potential to change the way in which we imagine the future. Fumagalli uses the myth of Medusa's gaze turning people into stone to describe the way North Atlantic modernity freezes its "others" into a state of perpetual backwardness that produces an ethnocentric narrative based on homogenization, vilification, and disempowerment that actively ignores what fails to conform to the story it wants to tell about itself. In analyzing narratives of modernity that originate in the Caribbean, the author explores the region's refusal to succumb to Medusa's spell and highlights its strategies to outstare the Gorgon. Reflecting a diversity of texts, genres, and media, the chapters focus on sixteenth-century engravings and paintings from the Netherlands and Italy, a scientific romance produced at the turn of the twentieth century by the king of the Caribbean island Redonda, contemporary collections of poetry from the anglophone Caribbean, a historical novel by the Guadeloupean writer Maryse Condé, a Latin epic, a Homeric hymn, ancient Egyptian rites, fairy tales, romances from England and Jamaica, a long narrative poem by the Nobel Prize winner Derek Walcott, and paintings by artists from Europe and the Americas spanning the seventeenth century to the present. Caribbean Perspectives on Modernity offers an original and creative contribution to what it means to be modern.},

Fully illustrated, the value of the work is reinforced by additional key data to be found in the appendices, including the 1866 and 1898 Directories of Foreign Residents, the 1872 List of Property being Rented, a List of Existing Cultural Assets of the Former Nagasaki Foreign Settlement and a chronology of 'Madame Butterfly and Nagasaki'.},

	abstract = {Dr. Gordon Wells is currently Professor of Education at the University of California, Santa Cruz, where he researches and teaches in the fields of: language, literacy, and learning; the analysis of classroom interaction; and sociocultural theory. As an educator, his particular interest is in fostering dialogic inquiry as an approach to learning and teaching at all levels, based on the work of Vygotsky and other sociocultural theorists. The rationale for this approach together with examples of it in practice are presented in Dialogic inquiry: Towards a Sociocultural Practice and Theory of Education (Cambridge University Press, 1999). From 1969 to 1984, he was the Director of the Bristol Study of Language Development at Home and at School, and from 1984 to 2000, he was a professor at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of the University of Toronto, where he was involved in several collaborative action research projects with educational practitioners in Canada. Chief among these was a project entitled âeoeDeveloping Inquiring Communities in Educationâe (DICEP), which was funded by the Spencer Foundation. Books arising from this work are Constructing Knowledge Together (Heinemann, 1992), Changing Schools from Within (OISE Press and Heinemann, 1994), and Action, Talk and Text: Learning and Teaching through Inquiry, written with his DICEP teacher colleagues, (Teachers College Press, 2001).

	abstract = {Blue heaven, green earth; betwixt the two the big old cherry tree in full blossom, with the sunshine drawing the sweet, heavy scent of honey from the blooms till the air was almost sickly and even the bees were glutted. Suddenly into the honeyed sweetness burst the passionate cry of a peacock with its long-drawn tang of bitterness. He belonged to the public park but, wearying of its confines, he had flown the fence, wandering through the little pine grove and thence into our old garden. From head to tail he was magnificent and knew it, arrogantly flaunting his beauty as he came. Beneath the cherry tree he paused and cried again. I, looking from the window of the old studio in the barn, close above the tree, wondered how the cherry tree felt about this rival loveliness, but the peacock seemed to draw yet more glory out of the tree, using it as a setting for himself, as he spread his tail and strutted back and forth. Presently he flew to the low roof of the barn. The grey shingles still further enhanced the beauty of his colouring as he mounted the slope with mincing steps. Then he spied the mirror formed by the folding back of the dormer window. He ran to it with evident delight and began to peer and prance and preen before it, bending his small, lovely head this way and that, dancing and spreading his tail in a shower of glory. Then he saw me. The indifferent way in which he looked me over made me feel like the poor shabby little girl at the party. Just a careless glance, then he returned to his mirror where he remained all day as though he could not bear to part with himself. Towards evening his appetite overcame his pride and he returned to the park. Next day, before the dew was gone, he was back at his mirror. I heard him call in the pines and then he was up on the roof. I offered some wheat but he had breakfasted and only desired to feed his vanity. From the sunshine he absorbed the glint and glisten, from the quiet grey roof the contrast which multiplied and offset his brilliance; from me he tried to draw admiration and flattery. His beauty pleased me but I resented his arrogance. "Vain creature!" I said. "Pretty youÃ¢ÂÂd look if they turned you inside out and showed your selfish, shabby heart." I turned to my work, disgusted at his conceit. He continued to come every day and I grew to like him there behind me as I worked. Sometimes I pandered to his conceit and applauded his showing off. Then he was pleased and would come and sit on the window-shelf in the far corner, gradually moving closer and closer until his head, surmounted by that glorious coronet of sparkling feathers, rested on my shoulder, and my hand had to steal out and caress it. Subtly the bird was drawing from me, as he had drawn from everything else. I knew it, but I knew also that now he was returning what he drew, tenfold. Suddenly I sensed the loneliness of this creature, hatched from an egg, brooded over by a common domestic hen. No kith, no kin: his looking-glass self the only mate he had ever known. I learned his call. He answered from the pine wood and came hurrying. Often his call woke me in the morning. Spring passed: the blossoms were cherries now, the bees had moved to the clover patch. The long summer days passed and the crisp autumn ones, and every day the peacock and I screeched our greeting and spent long companionable hours. Then one day I kissed his crest, put him out, and closed the window. That night I went abroad. In my absence a parson occupied the studio and wrote sermons there. He closed the wall-cracks with newspaper to keep out the singing wind, and caught the mice in traps. "What of my peacock?" I wrote home. "He came once, the morning after you left. Since then he has not come at all," was the reply. "We see him strutting in the park, delighted with admiration. He has doubtless forgotten you," they added. I was absent for over five years. When a young thing stays out of her own world as long as that, and comes back grown, it is hard to fit in. Some things have grown ahead of you, and you have grown ahead of others. I ran up the rickety barn stairs to the studio. Phew! How musty and "sermony" it smelt! Even as I crossed to the window I was peeling off strips of the parsonÃ¢ÂÂs newspaper. I threw the dormer wide. The garden was full of November fog. "Come in, old fog, and souse out the sermons," I cried. Everything was drab: the cherry tree, old, past bearing, had been cut down. I thought of the peacock. "Gone where good peacocks go," I sighed, and wondered where that was. Next morning I was busy on the floor with a pail of suds. Hark! In my rush the suds were knocked over and trickled through the floor onto the back of the patient cow below. I leaned from the window and screeched that unwritable screech. It was answered instantly. The peacock was hurrying througgh theeeee garden, unmindful of his tail, whhich swept the leaves and dirt. Hurrying, hurrying, not to the mirror--he could have had that all these years--but to me. "Oh, peacock! Now I know that if they did turn you inside out your loyal heart would be lovelier than your feathers!" How was he aware, that morning, that I had come? I do not know. That is one of the mysteries, and his secret. The park was out of earshot, and I had not been there. What a pity this happiness could not have continued for years and years, for I hear that peacocks live to a great age. But the park belonged to the people, and the people missed the peacock. A rumble of little grumbles arose. What right had an individual to monopolize public property? They complained to the keepers, who complained to the City fathers, whose fatherly instructions were "Pen the peacock". Locked up among the sentimental doves and the stupid owls, the peacock beat his breast against the wires in vain. His feathers and his pride were broken. The glow and sparkle of his plumage dulled, went out. His head sagged forward, wings drooped. He remembered no more the way of brag and display, nor how to spread his tail; it dragged heavily in the dirt. I tried to cheer him in the padlocked pen. I begged in vain for his release. He belonged to the taxpayers: the City demanded its taxes; the taxpayers demanded their pound of flesh. It gave them satisfaction to see their property securely penned before their eyes. They tried to "shoo" the peacock into strutting for them, and when they did not succeed they said, "Stupid brute! He sulks," and turned away. When next they came the pen was empty. "Where is the peacock?" they asked the keeper. "Dead." "So? I suppose you saved his feathers? Will you give us some?" "They wasnÃ¢ÂÂt worth the saving," the man replied. "All the glint went off Ã¢ÂÂem when his heart broke."},

Many of these concerns are chronicled in a new book called 'Living Waters: Reading the Rivers of the Lower Great Lakes' by Margaret Wooster, a Buffalo, N.Y. resident and former executive director of Great Lakes United (a longtime Canada-U.S. citizens coalition around the lakes). Wooster's book should be must reading for Great Lakes residents and is made all the more moving by the author's first-hand accounts of hiking along or canoing on so many of the waters she is writing about.


In that spirit, Canadian and U.S. mayors and regional chairs around the Great Lakes, including St. Catharines Mayor Brian McMullan, Niagara Falls Mayor Ted Salci, Port Colborne Mayor Vance Badawey and Niagara regional chairman Peter Partington, signed on to an "Action Plan to Protect the Great Lakes" this May that, among other things, concludes that "there may be no better way to strengthen the public's connection to the Great Lakes than to enhance and promote beaches and other shoreline activities. ... Drawing more people to the shoreline can also boost local economies and contribute to healthier lifestyles."},

	abstract = {Port Economics is the study of the economic decisions (and their consequences) of the users and providers of port services. A port is an "engine" for economic development by providing employment, worker incomes, business earnings and taxes for its region. The book provides a detailed discussion of types of carriers that use ports, the operation of cargo and passenger ports as well as the operation of such specific ports as Hong Kong, Hamburg, Le Havre, Savannah, Miami and Panama. Port Economics is the first contemporary textbook of its kind. It enhances our understanding of port economics by - classifying port users and suppliers of port services in the context of economic demand and supply curves; denoting that the demand for port services has two prices, the price paid to the port by the users and the price (or actual and opportunity costs) incurred by port user carriers, shippers and passengers; presenting the economic theories of carriers, shippers and passengers. The numerous up-to-date references will be of benefit to students and researchers of the economics of the shipping trade; to government officials in developing port and shipping policies; and to port operators in understanding the port-choice selection process by shipping lines and other carriers.},

This state-of-the science handbook is unique in approaching the topic from a developmental perspective. Exploring the dynamic relationship between biology and social behavior from infancy through adolescence, leading investigators discuss key processes in typical and atypical development. Chapters address emotion, motivation, person perception, interpersonal relationships, developmental disorders, and psychopathology. The volume sheds light on how complex social abilities emerge from basic brain circuits, whether there are elements of social behavior that are 'hard wired' in the brain, and the impact of early experiences. Illustrations include 8 color plates.},

	abstract = {Engagement in meaningful activity is an important aspect of human existence, regardless of one's cognitive abilities. Even in the later stages of dementia, people can still be engaged in activities at a level that allows them to be successful. In fact in these later stages, where cognitive abilities may be waning, the need for activity becomes greater, as cognitive stimulation helps preserve what skills remain. For care staff looking after older people, many of whom may have some degree of dementia, coming up with ideas for activities of a suitable level to keep their residents engaged and stimulated can be challenging. The Activity Year Book solves this problem, offering week by week themed activities. From Valentine's Day quizzes to Bonfire Night word searches, it has activities relating to every important date in the calendar, and also encourages reminiscence and discussion around these events. This book will be invaluable to care staff looking for a simple way of improving the lives of their residents, week by week, all year round.},

	abstract = {The Milky Way has captivated the mind of multitudes ever since the beginning of time. Particularly striking are its apparent dusty gaping voids. With the advent of near-infrared technology, astronomers have discovered an awesome new view of its structure, and of the structure of other galaxies around us. Galaxies are encased within shrouds of the night: shrouds or veils of cosmic dust, which have given us a totally incomplete picture of what our majestic Universe actually looks like. 
Shrouds of the Night features some of the  most remarkable early photographic work of masters such as Isaac Roberts and Edward Barnard, before presenting to the reader the unmasked (dust penetrated) view of our cosmos, using some of the world's largest ground and space-based telescopes.
"Galaxies are the 'ecosystems' of the cosmos - vast assemblages in which gas and dust are recycled through successive generations of stars. The authors of this beautiful book describe our ever-sharpening view of the Milky Way, the galaxy that is our home - and the discovery of the other galaxies that are its neighbors in deep space. Their voyage lies not in seeking new landscapes but in having new eyes. In fine images and eloquent text, the two distinguished authors convey the fascination - indeed the inspiration - of this scientific quest."
-Lord Martin Rees of Ludlow OM Kt PRS
Astronomer Royal, President of the Royal Society, Professor of Cosmology and Astrophysics, University of Cambridge.
"It's hard to decide what is most appealing about this unusual offering:
its brilliantly chosen treasury of illustrations, or the text's poetic
journey of discovery from smoke to galaxies, from the minuscule to the
gigantic and the astonishing connections between them.  Along the path are
rich insights into the varieties of astronomical seeing, from the history
of photography to the space telescopes that extend our vision beyond the
visible.  Historical connections are everywhere, from Jean Petit's
16th-century woodblock initials to excursions into a stately attic and to
photographic archives.  Enjoy the treat, including the reflections on the
deep meaning of it all!"

-Owen Gingerich
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, author of God's Universe
A lot of historical material which has never been published before - such as material from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona and the archives of the Royal Astronomical Society of London
Pioneering astronomical photographs by Roberts, Barnard, Keeler and others. Many of these will be made available to the general public for the first time
Our dust penetrated cosmos: results have been published in many technical journals, but these again will be made accessible to the general reader, for the first time
The reader is taken to the cutting edge of our knowledge about galaxies where the authors explore major new challenges and concepts facing the astronomical community today

	abstract = {At a crossroads in the Mississippi Delta, Robert Johnson is said to have sold his soul to the Devil so that he could become a guitar virtuoso and King of the Delta Blues. 

Blues Traveling: The Holy Sites of Delta Blues will tell you where that legendary deal was supposed to have been made and guide you to all the other hallowed grounds that nourished Mississippi's signature music.
Johnson, Mississippi John Hurt, Memphis Minnie, Jimmie Rodgers, Bessie Smith, Muddy Waters, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Howlin' Wolf, B. B. King, Little Milton, Elvis Presley, Bobby Rush, Junior Kimbrough, R. L. Burnside-the list of great artists with Mississippi connections goes on and on.
A trip through Mississippi blues sites is a pilgrimage every music lover ought to make at least once in a lifetime, to see the juke joints and churches, to visit the birthplaces and graves of blues greats, to walk down the dusty roads and over the levee, to eat some barbecue and greens, to sit on the bank of the Mississippi River, and to hear some down-home blues music.

Blues Traveling is the first and only guidebook to Mississippi's musical places and blues history. With photographs, maps, easy-to-follow directions, and an informative, entertaining text, this book will lead you in and out of Clarksdale, Greenwood, Helena (Arkansas), Rolling Fork, Jackson, Natchez, Bentonia, Rosedale, Itta Bena, and dozens of other locales that generations of blues musicians have lived in, traveled through, and sung about. Stories, legends, and lyrics are woven into the text so that each backroad and barroom comes alive.
Touring Mississippi with
Blues Traveling is like having a knowledgeable and entertaining guide at your side. Even people with no immediate plans to visit Mississippi will enjoy reading the book for its photos, descriptions, and lore that will broaden their understanding and enhance their appreciation of the blues.

	abstract = {This book offers something that few other textbooks do: an accessible and understandable approach to discern the implications of complicated research.  It will be a useful resource in courses on team building, multicultural and international issues at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. I was most impressed with the use of research from so many different cultures. Too often we take a Western, or even a U.S., perspective and assume that our way is the best way without understanding the cultural contexts. This material certainly avoids that trap.

Roger Ritvo, Ph.D., Distinguished Research Professor of Management, Auburn University Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama, USA

Using a fascinating journey of real life stories, a solid theoretical overview, and practical tools, Halverson and Tirmizi take us deep into the setup of different cultures, how they function, sources of potential collisions, and how best to benefit from this wonderful diversity that
today's globalization provides.  In today's growing globalization, this unprecedented comprehensive book is a must have for all individuals, teams, and organizations that seek to capitalize on the rich diversity of culturally diverse teams.

Nader Tadros, Founder and Director, People's Advocacy, Fairfax, Virginia, USA, Formerly Middle East Director, America's Development Foundation, Cairo, Egypt

Effective Multicultural Teams: Theory and Practice is a profound, powerful and fascinating text for graduate students who want to have a better understanding of the basics of multicultural teams. This book is the result of several years of teaching, consulting and researching by the authors on various relevant issues of multicultural teams. The breadth and depth of coverage of this book are extraordinary and its educational importance cannot be over estimated. It offers a comprehensive approach for creating an effective bridge between theory andpractice. In today's globalized market economy, both profit and non-profit sectors are emphasizing performance improvement at all levels of their activities and this cannot be achieved without maximizing the benefits of cultural diversity. On many aspects this publication goes beyond the simple quick fixes of high performing multicultural teams by adding life experiences which are inspirational and practical.

	abstract = {For those assembling a pile of kids' books in preparation forsummer, here's some good reading. Written by Bonny Becker and illustrated by Kady MacDonald Denton, A Visitor for Bear (Candlewick, 32 pages, \$18.50, ages 2 to 4) addresses that seasonal topic of unwanted guests. Curmudgeonly Bear doesn't like visitors, but a mouse who comes tap-tap-tapping at the door won't take no for an answer. After many attempts to keep the mouse out, Bear finds that a visitor who is "most attentive" and laughs heartily at his jokes might be welcome after all - and even turn out to be a friend. Denton works her inimitable, good-humoured magic in the ink and watercolour art pendulous Bear looms scowling over a tiny grey mouse whose very posture exudes self-respect and charm. Delightful. A voracious guest is featured in The Tiger Who Came to Tea (Harper, 32 pages, \$11.99, ages 2 to 4), written and illustrated by Judith Kerr and now in a 40th-anniversary edition featuring "furry" stripes. Sophie and mummy happily welcome a tiger for tea. But after he's eaten all the buns, biscuits, cake and even the packets and tins in the cupboards, along with drinking the milk, tea, daddy's beer and all the water in the tap, what is left for daddy's dinner? Kerr's matter-of-fact voice and Sophie and mummy's aplomb with their large, hungry visitor make a slyly funny contrast with the extravagant events of the plot. Although the nuclear family may be a little dated, the exotic splendour of the visitor has lost none of its appeal. Writer/illustrator Jeremy Tankard offers a cave-person- language approach to eating in Me Hungry! (Candlewick, 32 pages, \$17.50, ages 2 to 4). "Me hungry!" asserts Edwin the cave boy; "Me busy!" replies his harassed cave mom. And poor Edwin meets with nothing but rejection until he finds a creature whose reply to "me hungry" is "me too" - the beginning of a beautiful friendship as mastodon and boy find food together. Tankard's bold black lines and full-colour pages reinforce the humour in Edwin's direct desires and linguistic starkness. The joke will mean all the more to kids old enough to recognize the ungrammatical "me hungry." Eleanor Farjeon's classic Elsie Piddock Skips in Her Sleep (Candlewick, 40 pages, \$7.50, ages 4 to 8), illustrated by Charlotte Voake, is another welcome reissue. Even at 7, Elsie, born under Mount Caburn, skips as "never so." That's how she draws the attention of Caburn's fairy skippers and skipping master Andy-Spandy, who tutors Elsie for a year and leaves her with the gift of a fairy skipping rope. Years later, when a greedy developer threatens the skipping grounds on Caburn, Elsie's immortal skipping skills once again come into play, in a story that's elegant and magical. Farjeon is a queen of children's poetry and fairy tales, and this story shouldn't be missed. For readers interested in construction, Maxwell Newhouse's The House That Max Built (Tundra, 32 pages, \$22.99, ages 3 to 6) offers the pleasures of observing all the stages of house building, from finding just the right spot by the lake and drawing up plans, to landscaping the garden and painting the fence. Each stage is described in a sentence or two and accompanied by a page of Newhouse's folk art illustration. Attention to the details of construction and to the setting makes this good for re-reading - and re-viewing. Spectacularly successful gardening underlies Celia Barker Lottridge's counting book One Watermelon Seed (Fitzhenry and Whiteside, 32 pages, \$17.95, ages 2 to 5), now reissued with bright, computer-generated illustrations by Karen Patkau. Josephine and Max plant a garden with one watermelon seed, two pumpkin seeds and so on, all the way up to 10 corn seeds.},

	abstract = {J. E. R. Staddon's colleagues and former students discuss Staddon's work as a "theoretical behaviorist" and his influence on their own research. John Staddon has devoted his long and distinguished career to the study of the adaptive function and mechanisms of learning. He did his graduate work at the famous Skinner Lab at Harvard in the early 1960s (supervised by Richard Herrnstein, who did his doctoral work with B. F. Skinner), but his work can be characterized as theoretical behaviorism. Staddon, now at Duke University, believes that experimental analysis is never enough to make sense of behavior and that "theoretical imagination" is also required. Staddon's theoretical imagination has distinguished his work over the years and has influenced the field. Staddon is not afraid to deviate from the norm: when psychologists were maintaining their distance from behavioral psychology, Staddon was promoting optimality theories. Optimality theories in psychology are now commonplace. In this volume, Staddon's colleagues and former students discuss topics that have been important in his work: behavioral ability and choice, memory, time and models (the subject of his work at Harvard), and behaviorism. They also reflect on Staddon's influence on their own work and the evolution of their thinking on these topics. Contributors Giulio Bolacchi, Daniel T. Cerutti, Mircea Ioan Chelaru, J.

He tells the stories of several of Catalonia's great figures: Abbot Olivia, who brought Moorish learning to Europe, the ruthless mercenary, Roger de Flor, and Verdaguer, handsome poet-priest.Catalonia is famous today for its twentieth-century art. This book focuses on the revolutionary Art Nouveau buildings (including the Sagrada Família) of Antoni Gaudí. It also explores the region's artistic legacy: the young Picasso painting Barcelona's vibrant slums; Salvador Dalí, inspired by the twisted rocks of Cap de Creus to paint his landscapes of the human mind; and Joan Miró, discovering the colors of the red earth at Montroig.},

From the foreword by Julian Tudor Hart
"Trish Greenhalgh, in her frequent columns in the British Medical Journal...more than any other medical journalist spoke to her fellow GPs in the language of experience, but never without linking this to our expanding knowledge from the whole of human science.


When I compare the outlines of primary care so lucidly presented in this wonderful book, obviously derived from rich experience of real teaching and learning, with the grand guignol theatre of London medical schools when I was a student 1947-52, the advance is stunning."

"Trish Greenhalgh is one of the international stars of general practice and a very clever thinker. This new book is a wonderful resource for primary health care and general practice. Every general practice registrar should read this book and so should every general practice teacher and primary care researcher."


Professor Michael Kidd, Head of the Department of General Practice, University of Sydney and Immediate Past President of The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners


"This important new book by one of primary care's most accomplished authors sets out clearly the academic basis for further developments in primary health care. Health systems will only function effectively if they recognise the importance of high quality primary care so I strongly recommend this book to students, teachers, researchers, practitioners and policy makers."

	abstract = {Water, the staff of life, is under threat in every part of Canada. Canada has 7 per cent of the world's land surface, and 7 per cent of the world's renewable fresh water. This balance belies the image of Canada awash in fresh water, but even this abundance, according to the National Water Research Institute is "relative rather than absolute." Most Canadians live only a few miles from the U.S. border, but two-thirds of our fresh water flows north toward the Arctic or Hudson's Bay.                If bulk water exports are one threat, failures in joint water management are another. Devil's Lake, for example, is a shallow, stagnant pool in a landlocked basin in North Dakota. The lake is so polluted that it cannot be used for irrigation. Its levels, however, have been rising, causing widespread flooding. Most of the problems of Devil's Lake are self-inflicted. North Dakota has drained 80 thousand hectares of wetlands, and as Hurricane Katrina proved beyond a doubt, it is wetlands that prevent flooding.                 Rather than a strategy of "deep integration" on water, Canada should strive for "maximum autonomy" - autonomy to build a distinctive, just and harmonious environmental way of life in our part of North America. Water is the place to start.},

For over twenty years he has been working at the intersection of economics and psychology and is one of the few people of whom it can be said that their work is equally respected and well known within both disciplines. This book brings together a selection of his papers focusing on what he calls "exotic preferences"-- the disparate motives that drive human behavior. In addition to covering the history and methodology of behavioral economics, they also touch on a wide range of fascinating topics such as the motives that drive extreme athletes, our propensity to want to get unpleasant experiences out of the way so we can focus on the more pleasant, and the psychology of curiosity. There are also papers on social preferences, discussing the importance of perceptions of fairness in interpersonal interactions, intertemporal choice-- the tradeoffs between costs and benefits occurring at different points in time-- and the impact of emotion on economic decision making.; An original introduction outlines Loewenstein's general approach to research, and there are short introductions to each paper outlining briefly when, how and why they came to be written, providing a fascinating and vivid insight into the process of intellectual creativity.},

	abstract = {To make the task even tougher, the invaders are enmeshed in a second industry. In the 19th century, Havana had a thriving commercial fishery - it died when Chicago's waste was diverted south, into the Illinois River. A sports fishery emerged in the 1990s, but, says biologist [Kevin Irons], Asian carp muscled out largemouth bass and bullhead. Now, Asian carp are themselves becoming profitable. Processing plants turn the bony beasts into minced flesh for human consumption, pet food and fertilizer. The fish fetch just 22 to 44 cents (U.S.) a kilogram, but it's enough for some local fishermen to earn a good living. Last year, one landed more than 900,000 kilos. This year, he's out in a brand new boat.                 The city has substantially cleaned up its effluent. Now the environmental hazard moves south to north. Asian carp haven't been seen closer than 40 kilometres from Romeoville, but scientists figure it's only a matter of time. For now, large numbers are found in the Illinois River only as far upstream as Ottawa. But that doesn't mean they won't go farther they've always expanded in fits and starts, whenever river conditions, or their numbers, allowed the next leap forward.                For now, [Chuck Shea] monitors the barrier, usually from his Chicago office, and waits for the funding dispute to be settled. The invaders are still down in the Illinois River, and over the past few years, they haven't moved as much as expected. But "they are working their way here," he asserts. "Even if the whole group doesn't come, there's always the possibility of one or two."},

	abstract = {The Amerindian (American Indian or Native American - reference to both North and South America) practice of taking and displaying various body parts as trophies has long intrigued both the research community as well as the public. As a subject that is both controversial and politically charged, it has also come under attack as a European colonists' perspective intended to denigrate native peoples. 
What this collection demonstrates is that the practice of trophy-taking predates European contact in the Americas but was also practiced in other parts of the world (Europe, Africa, Asia) and has been practiced prehistorically, historically and up to and including the twentieth century.
This edited volume mainly focuses on this practice in both North and South America. The editors and contributors (which include Native Peoples from both continents) examine the evidence and causes of Amerindian trophy taking as reflected in osteological, archaeological, ethnohistoric and ethnographic accounts. Additionally, they present objectively and discuss dispassionately the topic of human proclivity toward ritual violence.Filling the gap in literature on Amerindian human trophy taking, it is remarkable that there has been only one previous (and now dated) scholarly work specifically addressing this topic on a continent-wide basis. This volume will fill the gap in the literature Presents cases of this practice throughout North and South America Demonstrates that evidence of this phenomenon can be found in many other cultures and places in ancient and recent time making it a human proclivity toward ritual violence, not a "Native" one

	abstract = {The sleepy town of Lion's Head offers more than just a pit stop on the way to Tobermory. Lion's Head Beach Park is a scenic place for lunch: picnic tables and harbourfront barbecues are set against a dramatic backdrop of limestone cliffs. The Bruce Trail joins with the Lion's Head Provincial Nature Reserve, home to 10,000-year-old glacial potholes. Novice hikers be warned: after the second pothole, the trail leading to McKay's Harbour gets very challenging. The terrain is rocky, with sudden dips and steep climbs. It's worth the effort, though: the clifftop views of Georgian Bay are spectacular. For an aprèshike drink, stop by Lion's Head Inn or hop over to Mary-Dale's, a local favourite, for a meal. If you decide to stay the night, camping is available at Lion's Head Beach Park and Campground. The best times to visit are summer or fall, as most tourist sites, such as the Artists' Co-Op Gallery (home to handcrafted works by artists from the Grey and Bruce counties), close after Thanksgiving. Outside of peak season, charming clothing and tinker shops are open to visitors every Saturday until Christmas.              Owners Gwen and Ron Boyles have built an 80-by-200-foot indoor arena roomy enough to run a sulky, plus an outdoor dressage ring, spacious stalls and woodland trails that can keep you riding all day. If you don't own a horse, you can always ride one of the stable's Arabs, Warmbloods or quarter horses. Even novices are made welcome with an introductory lesson. Guests who don't care to ride can watch the proceedings from the arena's secondfloor viewing lounge or head for one of nine nearby golf courses. If a day on the greens doesn't appeal, you can roam the inn's grounds, play tennis or go hiking on trails in the nearby Northumberland Forest. Guest suites are tucked away from the main residence in a spacious outbuilding. A wall of windows streams light onto a queen-size French-style iron bed in the upper suite (it's surrounded by treetops, making curtains unnecessary). Guests trek to the main house come morning, when the Boyleses cook up a fortify ing breakfast. Dinner can also be arranged.              For those old enough to remember summer outings in Dad's Chevy, rolling through farm country, a trip via Leslie Street to Jackson's Point will be a nostalgic excursion. Make your way to the shores of Lake Simcoe, and travel past pockets of beach houses and parklands until you arrive in Jackson's Point. Don't miss the Briars (55 Hedge Rd., 905-722-3271), a nearby resort and conference centre, is worth a stop any time of year. The compound, built around a mid-i9thcentury home known as the Manor House, is a quirky example of late Georgian architecture. If you feel so rested you don't want to leave, book a room in the Manor, or in one of the cottages on the property. On departing the Briars, stop in at St. George's Anglican Church (408 Hedge Rd., Sibbald Point Provincial Park). The 1877 building, with its heritage hedge, lakeside cemetery and lych-gate, looks as if it's been plucked from an English village. The cemetery holds graves from as far back as the late 18305; writers Stephen Leacock and Mazo de la Roche rest here. Finish the day off with a hike or swim, or hunker down at Sibbald Point Provincial Park (26465 York Rd. 18, Rural Rd. 2, Sutton West, 905-722-8061), where there's lots of room for camping. In its midst is the Sibbald family's original home, Eildon Hall, now a museum.},

	abstract = {[Gord Miller] reminisced about his days as a student at U of G, when he would go on smelt runs to Lake Erie in April. "People would go down with a big net and bring home buckets of fish, but you don't have that anymore."  


Miller said the same thing has to happen now. "We undertook a massive societal effort, and we did improve Lake Erie," he said. "We need to recommit to the lakes. We've done it before and we can do it again."


Although Guelph is landlocked, Miller said the city does see effects of climate change related to the Great Lakes. Snow squalls and lake effect storms have been common for Guelph. Miller said climate change has greatly affected the upper Great Lakes. In past years the lakes have frozen in the winter, so when winds blow across the lake water doesn't evaporate.},

With contributions from leading researchers in health psychology and gerontology, the Handbook integrates state-of-the-science theories and methods from both fields. Key topics include how aging affects the cardiovascular, neuroendocrine, and immune systems; the influences on adult development and health of personality, emotions, social support, and religiousness; and effective interventions in healthcare settings.},

	abstract = {Squeezed between more powerful France and Spain, Catalonia has endured a violent history. Its medieval empire that conquered Naples, Sicily and Athens was crushed by Spain. Its geography, with the Pyrenees falling sharply to the rugged Costa Brava, is tormented, too.Michael Eaude traces this history and its monuments: Roman Tarragona, celebrated by the poet Martial; Greek Empuries, lost for centuries beneath the sands; medieval Romanesque architecture in the Vall de Boi churches (a World Heritage Site) and Poblet and Santes Creus monasteries. He tells the stories of several of Catalonias great figures: Abbot Oliva, who brought Moorish learning to Europe, the ruthless mercenary, Roger de Flor, and Verdaguer, handsome poet-priest.Catalonia is famous today for its twentieth-century art. This book focuses on the revolutionary Art Nouveau buildings (including the Sagrada Familia) of Antoni Gaudi. It also explores the regions artistic legacy: the young Picasso painting Barcelonas vibrant slums; Salvador Dali, inspired by the twisted rocks of Cap de Creus to paint his landscapes of the human mind; and Joan Miro, discovering the colours of the red earth at Montroig.},

	abstract = {Stimulated by "Noah's Flood Hypothesis" proposed by W. Ryan and W. Pitman in which a catastrophic inundation of the Pontic basin was linked to the biblical story, leading experts in Black Sea research (including oceanography, marine geology, paleoclimate, paleoenvironment, archaeology, and linguistic spread) provide overviews of their data and interpretations obtained through empirical scientific approaches. Among the contributors are many East European scientists whose work has rarely been published outside of Cyrillic. Each of the 35 papers marshals its own evidence for or against the flood hypothesis. No summary or overall resolution to the flood question is presented, but instead access is provided to a broad range of interdisciplinary information that crosses previously impenetrable language barriers so that new work in the region can proceed with the benefit of a wider frame of reference. The three fundamental scenarios describing the late glacial to Holocene rise in the level of the Black Sea--catastrophic, gradual, and oscillating--are presented in the early pages, with the succeeding papers organized by geographic sector: northern (Ukraine), western (Moldova, Romania, and Bulgaria), southern (Turkey), and eastern (Georgia and Russia), as well as three papers on the Mediterranean. The volume thus brings together eastern and western scholarship to share research findings and perspectives on a controversial subject. In addition, appendices are included containing some 600 radiocarbon dates from the Pontic region obtained by USSR and western laboratories. 
Audience
Scientists, researchers and students in geology, climatology, archeology, oceanography, linguistics, history, geography as well as Black Sea specialists.
The only book on the Black Sea flood hypothesis, a topic of intense scientific and popular interest (the subject of a National Geographic Special in the US: Ballard and the Black Sea) No other book comparable in content, both in its coverage of geological and anthropological clues to Black Sea prehistory Includes contributions of Eastern researchers which have rarely been published ouside of Cyrillic},

	abstract = {In an attempt to improve, or replace, existing food processing methods, several novel technologies have been investigated. Some of these emerging technologies have become alternative means of developing new foods or improving the safety and quality of existing ones while reducing energy consumption for the food industry. 
Among all emerging nonthermal technologies, high intensity pulsed electric fields (PEF) is one of the most appealing due to its short treatment times and reduced heating effects. Its capability to enhance extraction processes and to inactivate microorganisms at temperatures that do not cause any deleterious effect on flavor, color or nutrient value of foods, opens interesting possibilities for the food processing industry.
This book presents the information accumulated on PEF during the last 15 years by experienced microbiologists, biochemists, food technologists, and electrical and food engineers. It offers to anyone interested in this subject a comprehensive knowledge in this field.

About the Editors:
Javier Raso is a Professor of Food Technology at the University of Zaragoza in Spain.
Volker Heinz is a Head of the German Institute of Food Technology at Quakenbrueck.

Historic cities like Arles, Avignon and Aix contain Roman amphitheatres, papal palaces and royal residences, while market towns and picturesque villages maintain age-old traditions of wine producing and agriculture. From the highland towns of Digne and Sisteron to the marshy expanse of the Camargue, Provence encompasses a rich variety of landscapes.Martin Garrett explores a region littered with ancient monuments and medieval castles. Looking at the vibrant dockside ambiance of Marseille and the luminous atmosphere of the Lubéron, he considers how writers like Mistral and Daudet have captured the character of a place and its people. He traces the development of Provence as a Roman outpost, medieval kingdom and modern region of France, revealing through its landmarks the people and events that have shaped its often tumultuous history.Through its architecture, literature and popular culture, this book analyzes and celebrates the identity of a region famous for its pastis and pétanque. Linking the past to the present, it also evokes the intense light and sun-baked stones that have attracted generations of painters and writers.},

Global warming is yet another threat, which in Canada might manifest itself in a variety of changes to its climate: rising sea levels on both coasts, melting perma-frost, dropping reservoir levels, drought, the need for more irrigation, loss of glacial melt and much more. Even today, said Bielak, Alberta experiences winter forest fires.


As a NATO scholar, Bielak earned his Ph.D. from the University of Waterloo. In the course of his career he has held the posts of Executive Director (Canada) of the Atlantic Salmon Federation, Director of Fisheries Management for the Province of New Brunswick and Research Manager with both Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Environment Canada.},

In 2000, more than 25 million walleye were caught (nearly 6.5 million harvested) in Ontario waters. In 2000, anglers fished more than 11 million days and resident fishing licence sales in the Southern Region were close to 750,000.},

There are clear gender differences in genetic expression, physiologic function, metabolism, hormonal makeup, and psychosocial profile, which often modify the clinical expression of neurologic and other diseases. In addition, ethnic, cultural, and economic factors are frequently overlooked in dealing with health problems of women, even though they undoubtedly have a strong influence on the clinical course of the illness. 
The second edition of
Neurologic Disease in Women, the only text to specifically cover this important topic, will help physicians and other medical personnel seeking information relevant to clinical care. Sections address general anatomic, hormonal, epidemiologic, and drug aspects of women's health; neurologic conditions that arise during childhood, pregnancy, adulthood, and old age in females; and particular neurologic conditions that present differently or predominantly in females.
There have been important advances in several areas prompting new chapters, new approaches and additional information provided in chapters on hormonal effects in women and the use of HRT; the adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs on hormonal homeostasis, weight and bone health; and cardiovascular diseases in women. New chapters include ones on reproductive and metabolic disorders with AED use, and on movement disorders.},

	abstract = {Marine natural products have attracted the attention of biologists and chemists the world over for the past five decades. As a result of the potential for new drug discovery, marine natural products have attracted scientists from different disciplines, such as organic chemistry, bioorganic chemistry, pharmacology, biology and ecology. This interest has led to the discovery of almost 16,000 marine natural products to date and many of the compounds have shown very promising biological activity. The ocean is considered to be a great source of potential drugs. 
Bioactive Marine Natural Products is the first book available that covers all aspects of bioactive marine natural products. It fills the void in the literature for bioactive marine natural products. The book covers various aspects of marine natural products and it is hoped that all the major classes of bioactive compounds are included. Different classes of marine organisms and the separation and isolation techniques are discussed. The chemistry and biology of marine toxins, peptides, alkaloids, nucleosides and prostanoids are discussed in detail. Biological, toxicological and clinical evaluations are also dealt with to ensure that the book may be adopted at any stage by any practicing organic chemist or biologist, working in academia or in R\&D divisions of pharmaceutical companies. Each chapter in the book includes an abstract to highlight the major points discussed in the text and concluding remarks are given. References to books, monographs, review articles and original papers are provided at the end of each chapter.First book available that covers all aspects of bioactive marine natural products, which are sources of potential drugs All major classes of bioactive compounds are included Covers biological, toxicological and clinical evaluations Covers the chemistry and biology of marine toxins, peptides, alkaloids, nucleosides and prostanoids Foreword by Sir Derek Barton, F.R.S., Nobel Laureate: "All aspects of Marine natural products are treated with authority in this book.

The Brahms Ave. project is just one of dozens intended to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, which trap the sun's heat in Earth's atmosphere.                 Those droughts could kill Toronto's trees. Without their cooling shade and ability to absorb greenhouse gases, the city gets hotter. Built-up areas are about 6 degrees Celsius warmer than those with trees, notes Eva Ligeti, head of the Clear Air Partnership, a city agency that helps to arrange funding for anti-pollution projects.                 [Ed Horner] is among those who argue Toronto is closer to pyrite than real gold. "Toronto is doing horribly. We've moved in entirely the wrong direction.

Human beings are uniquely concerned with the question and marvel of what it means to feel alive and real, as well as the lifelong struggle of being alive together.

Focusing on the challenge in any psychoanalytic theory to demonstrate the relation between culture, community, and the individual, LaMothe's theory provides a bridge between the three, arguing that organizations of experiences of being alive are inextricably yoked to cultural stories, rituals, and practices. Enlivened by clinical illustrations and examples drawn from wider culture, Becoming Alive brings together psychoanalytic developmental perspectives, infant-parent research, semiotics, and philosophy in providing a comprehensive, lucid, and systematic description of subjective and intersubjective experiences of being alive.},

E. coli indicates fecal contamination from warm-blooded animals including humans. Although most strains of E. coli are harmless, some strains can cause serious disease, such as in the Walkerton tragedy, which killed seven people and sickened 2,300.


The most important thing cottagers can do to decrease E. coli levels in the water is to discourage Canada geese from congregating on the property, by keeping a natural vegetated shoreline and a minimal manicured lawn. The report also advises checking the septic systems every three years and pumped out every five.},

	abstract = {"Yep. The juice is runnin' clear," says a cherubic woman in a period blue dress and bonnet, pulling at the leg of a roast chicken. "But I'd still prefer to nuke it in the microwave for a bit." She's standing by the hearth of a restored pioneer home, wrapping up the culinary demonstrations for the year's Pioneer Festival. Yes, the recreated Victorian-era town can be as kitschy as a theme park at times, but that's part of its charm. From May through December, the town's boardwalks and some 35 restored pioneer buildings teem with families and tourists. Guides play the roles of harness makers, tinsmiths, millers and cooks, demonstrating the chores and trades that formed the rough fabric of pioneer life. Children interact with the farm animals, learn how to make a Victorian musical instrument or write the old-fashioned way-with ink and quill. The focus shifts to school groups from September to December, but the site still remains open to sightseers. Start your self-guided tour at the site's set of six original buildings, built by the industrious Stong family, homesteaders who cleared the land for farming in the early 180Os. Their first log home, with its three cramped rooms and smoke-blackened stone hearth, is of particular interest, and a reminder of how arduous those Roughing It in the [Jack Bush] years must have been. Other highlights include Dickson's Hill Schoolhouse, and the Doctor's House, where an interpreter in period dress might talk about the doctor's role in the community (as a dentist, pediatrician and pharmacist, all rolled into one) and the curative uses of plants found in the medicinal herb garden.              Sprawling housing developments stretching north of the 401 are a testament to Oakville's status as Bay Street's bedroom community, yet this 178-year-old town has more to offer than backyard barbecues or box-store deals. For instance, Gairloch Gardens' 11 acres of manicured grounds (often a bride's choice for post-nuptial photography) are home to a pedigreed collection of contemporary art. For a fresh perspective on the preserved lakeside estate, take sound artist Janet Cardiff's site-specific audio walk that merges reality and fiction as it directs you around the grounds; or check out landscape innovator Plant's cedar hedge and mirror installations that reframe views of Lake Ontario. The estate's Tudor-style house, built in the 1920s, now hosts exhibitions by international and Canadian artists. [Frances Bond Head] west along Lakeshore Road to the downtown retail strip, where you can easily lighten your wallet by indulging in such essential luxuries as Burberry dog coats, Tuscan ceramics, Hugo Boss socks and copper garden ornaments. The main drag is dotted with cafés and restaurants, but if you're hankering for a picnic, provisioner Boffo's (350 Lakeshore Rd. E., 905-845-9303) can provide the gourmet fixings (grilled salmon, fresh flat-bread, prepared salads). The shady Lakeside Park offers the perfect sylvan setting for dining al fresco. Once sated, it's time for a quick hit of history. Thomas House (a two-room homestead) and the town's first post office were moved to this site in the 1950s; historical re-enactors tell you how it was in the olden days. Erchless Estate, the home of Oakville's founding father, William Chisholm, stands at the edge of the park. Built in 1858 and saved from the wrecking ball in 1976, it's been restored to how it would have looked in 1925. If hay barns and hiking trails are more your speed, drive 20 minutes west to Bronte Creek Provincial Park (page 37). With swimming facilities, exquisite fall colours and an excellent toboggan hill, the 684 hectares make it worthy of a day's excursion in any season.},

	abstract = {Liberty and freedom: Americans agree that these values are fundamental to our nation, but what do they mean? How have their meanings changed through time? In this new volume of cultural history, David Hackett Fischer shows how these varying ideas form an intertwined strand that runs through the core of American life.Fischer examines liberty and freedom not as philosophical or political abstractions, but as folkways and popular beliefs deeply embedded in American culture. Tocqueville called them "habits of the heart." From the earliest colonies, Americans have shared ideals of liberty and freedom, but with very different meanings. Like DNA these ideas have transformed and recombined in each generation.The book arose from Fischer's discovery that the words themselves had differing origins: the Latinate "liberty" implied separation and independence. The root meaning of "freedom" (akin to "friend") connoted attachment: the rights of belonging in a community of freepeople. The tension between the two senses has been a source of conflict and creativity throughout American history.Liberty \& Freedom studies the folk history of those ideas through more than 400 visions, images, and symbols. It begins with the American Revolution, and explores the meaning of New England's Liberty Tree, Pennsylvania's Liberty Bells, Carolina's Liberty Crescent, and "Don't Tread on Me" rattlesnakes. In the new republic, the search for a common American symbol gave new meaning to Yankee Doodle, Uncle Sam, Miss Liberty, and many other icons. In the Civil War, Americans divided over liberty and freedom. Afterward, new universal visions were invented by people who had formerly been excluded from a free society--African Americans, American Indians, and immigrants. The twentieth century saw liberty and freedom tested by enemies and contested at home, yet it brought the greatest outpouring of new visions, from Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms to Martin Luther King's "dream" to Janis Joplin's "nothin' left to lose."Illustrated in full color with a rich variety of images, Liberty and Freedom is, literally, an eye-opening work of history--stimulating, large-spirited, and ultimately, inspiring.},

	abstract = {For anyone lucky enough to remember Lady Eaton and the Irish waitresses of the Round Room or Glenn Gould's fanatical adoration of the Eaton Auditorium (closed since 1977), the May 2003 reopening of the seventh floor of the old Eaton's College Street was cause for celebration. Restored at a cost of \$8 million and renamed in honour of its designer, French architect Jacques Carlu, the 45,000-square-foot facility now attracts all the urban scene-makers, from fashion photographers and Orthodox newly-weds to very downtown councillor Kyle Rae, who held his kickoff fundraiser here. The art moderne showpiece is for folks "who want a sexier facility," says co-director Mark Robert. Think '30s Hollywood and its penthouse vision of New York: all the period details are in place, from the Lalique fountain in the Round Room to the ebony and bird's-eye maple in the auditorium. But it's also state-of-the-art, with new kitchens, larger washrooms, Internet hookups and two freight elevators. A 10,000-square-foot lobby opens onto a 1,200-seat auditorium that can accommodate 1,500 for cocktails and 600 for dinner. And, of course, there's the legendary Round Room (inspiration for New York's Rainbow Room), which can accommodate 450 for cocktails and 350 for dinner. Smaller rooms, too. Bookings extend into 2007.              [Don Mills]'t let the fancy dress fool you. [Anita Rossi Band] will make the gilded mirrors shake at the Four Seasons Hotel on New Year's Eve. For a peek at the bandleader, rent Sea of Love and scan for the wedding singer (she and the crew performed at a private party for John Goodman and Al Pacino while the film was shooting--Pacino got onstage and danced). Rossi is partial to danceable, crowd-pleasing grooves, from "Lady Marmalade" to "Mr. Big Stuff," though her range encompasses swing, funk, pop, disco and Latin tracks, plus such inevitable torch songs as Norah Jones's "Don't Know Why"--but they won't play "Hot Hot Hot" unless "forced at gunpoint."              [Holly Cole] and Louise Pitre once sang with the 19-year-old band, and [Whitney Smith] still has that indefinable cool that attracts the style-savvy denizens of Queen West. Blessed with the same instrumentation as the classic Count Basie and Duke Ellington big bands, his 17-piece band and various vocalists play a mix of standards and originals in a range of styles from swing to hot 'n' heavy Latin. Crowd-pleasers include "I've Got You Under My Skin," "Pennies From Heaven," "On the Street Where You Live," "Angel Eyes" and a house-jungle version of "Temptation" with a va-voom nightclub groove. "[Quincy Jones] and Nelson Riddle arrangements for the Bassey Band and [Frank Sinatra]--that's our roots music," says Whitney Smith, the band's founder, conductor and guitarist.},

He even defended the property against a provincial plan in the late 1960s to expropriate remaining undeveloped Lake Erie coastline for public beaches. The property, he argued, was more valuable as a part of Ontario's natural heritage, a refuge for species rapidly disappearing in the fast developing Niagara Peninsula, a learning lab for generations of naturalists to come. He was exploring placing a conservation easement on the deed when he died, thereby leaving Marcy's Woods to his heirs. This was the first tragic turn of events for Marcy's Woods.},

	abstract = {I know surveys are a pain in the neck under most circumstances, but this one is important in that stocking, conservation plans, protective programs against alien species and the development of plans to improve your fishing enjoyment will result from the findings of the study plus the ongoing biological studies by Ontario and New York State. It's hard to believe an increase in stocking chinook salmon could result in a disastrous breakdown in our fishing primarily from fish starving to death, similar to what happened in Lake Michigan a number of years ago.


Two aliens (on the plus side) are the alewives and smelts that are the main targets of the introduced Pacific Ocean salmon, the stocked lake trout, the rainbow trout, the brown trout and unfortunately, the Crested Cormorant flocks, which have cleaned out fish in the shallows and are now starting to pillage anything that swims in Lake Ontario.},

	abstract = {Parents and teachers today face a swirl of conflicting theories about child rearing and educational practice. Indeed, current guides are contradictory, oversimplified, and at odds with current scientific knowledge. Now, in Awakening Children's Minds, Laura Berk cuts through the confusion of competing theories, offering a new way of thinking about the roles of parents and teachers and how they can make a difference in children's lives. This is the first book to bring to a general audience, in lucid prose richly laced with examples, truly state-of-the-art thinking about child rearing and early education. Berk's central message is that parents and teachers contribute profoundly to the development of competent, caring, well-adjusted children. In particular, she argues that adult-child communication in shared activities is the wellspring of psychological development. These dialogues enhance language skills, reasoning ability, problem-solving strategies, the capacity to bring action under the control of thought, and the child's cultural and moral values. Berk explains how children weave the voices of more expert cultural members into dialogues with themselves. When puzzling, difficult, or stressful circumstances arise, children call on this private speech to guide and control their thinking and behavior. In addition to providing clear roles for parents and teachers, Berk also offers concrete suggestions for creating and evaluating quality educational environments--at home, in child care, in preschool, and in primary school--and addresses the unique challenges of helping children with special needs. Parents, Berk writes, need a consistent way of thinking about their role in children's lives, one that can guide them in making effective child-rearing decisions. Awakening Children's Minds gives us the basic guidance we need to raise caring, thoughtful, intelligent children.},

	abstract = {Fort York is a poignant reminder of Toronto's British origins and its efforts to remain independent from the United States. Since the original garrison's construction by the British as a border defence, it has been threatened numerous times and was taken over by the Americans during the War of 1812. While the Americans were a formidable menace to the structure, they were, perhaps, not quite as troublesome as the construction of the Gardiner Expressway in the '50s, which nearly demolished the historical site. A group of concerned citizens intervened and saved the buildings and the spirit of the place, fostered by mock soldiers (who march about in period costume) and archaeological exhibits (Spode china, money, wine bottles and other remnants unearthed on-site). The fort has two operating seasons: from Labour Day to Victoria Day, the focus is on school programs; in high season (Victoria Day to Labour Day), various tours are offered. They emphasize lifestyle, showing the officers' barracks and kitchen; fortifications, using scale models and a walk around the exterior walls; and artillery, examining various pieces of ordnance. There are also cooking demonstrations in the historical kitchen. A drill demo features musket and cannon firings in July and August. The best beginning to any tour is in Blockhouse no. 2, where a seven-minute video, photos and map displays encapsulate the fort's history. The 1815 officers' barracks and 1826 mess kitchen are furnished in period style and give a vivid feeling of garrison life. A sergeant's apartment is spartan in its simplicity, while the officers' dining room has notes of refinement in its floor, oval dining table, enormous wooden sideboard, win cooler and pianoforte in the corner. Special events include children's activities (such as a sleepover in one of two blockhouses, including dinner in a period barracks), and the site is available for weddings, featuring live period music, costumed wait staff and dinners with such exotica as cock-a-leekie soup, roast quail and syllabub (a traditional parfait dessert).              Nestled in the verdant Don Valley, this indoor-outdoor museum showcases early local industry. The site was named for the Yorkshire hometown of Thomas Helliwell Sr., who in the 1820s established one of the city's first breweries, plus a malt house and distillery. Today, five vintage structures thrive here. First is the Paper Mill, a display facility for rotating exhibits, such as Discovery of the Titanic and Early 19th-Century Beer and Brewing in Toronto. The Brewery Gallery, a one-storey white-washed structure just across the way, holds a permanent exhibit of archival photos and artifacts detailing the area's history (including the Don Valley Brickworks, page 86), its native wildlife and early industrial activity and family life. Nearby is the original Don station (looking like a tiny witch's house), which served the Belt Line Railway during its two years in operation, from 1891 to 1894. Originally located near Queen Street, it was lopped into pieces and moved to the Todmorden site in 1969. Two houses set on a low hill in the east side of the valley date from the first half of the 19th century: the large, two-storey Helliwell residence has a sombre 1860s Victorian interior and a Georgian exterior; the more modest single-storey Terry home was built and adorned in simpler 1830s decor. The unusual construction of the larger home is historically important: it's built of sun-dried adobe brick, probably due to Helliwell's knowledge of similar building practices in his native land, and it has stood up incredibly well in the intemperate Canadian climate. Extremely thick walls and a large roof overhang result in a solid and secure but rather dark and gloomy home; there's only a handful of such buildings left in all of Ontario. Many of the buildings' original features are being revealed in an ongoing restoration effort. Regular activities include a Harvest Festival (Sept. 21) and children's art workshops in July and August.},

	abstract = {The new edition of this definitive textbook reflects the continuing reintegration of psychiatry into the mainstream of biomedical science. The research tools that are transforming other branches of medicine - epidemiology, genetics, molecular biology, imaging, and medicinal chemistry - are also transforming psychiatry. The field stands poised to make dramatic advances in defining disease pathogenesis, developing diagnostic methods capable of identifying specific and valid disease entities, discovering novel and more effective treatments, and ultimately preventing psychiatric disorders. The Neurobiology of Mental Illness is written by world-renowned experts in basic neuroscience and the pathophysiology and treatment of psychiatric disorders. It begins with a succinct overview of the basic neurosciences followed by and evaluation of the tools that are available for the study of mental disorders in humans. The core of the book is a series of consistently organized sections on the major psychiatric disorders that cover their diagnostic classification, molecular genetics, functional neuroanatomy, neurochemistry and pharmacology, neuroimaging, and principles of pharmacotherapy.
Chapters are written in a clear style that is easily accessible to practising psychiatrists, and yet they are detailed enough to interest researchers and academics. For this second edition, every section has been thoroughly updated, and 13 new chapters have been added in areas where significant advances have been made, including functional genomics and animal models of illness; epidemiology; cognitive neuroscience; postmortem investigation of human brain; drug discovery methods for psychiatric disorders; the neurobiology of schizophrenia; animal models of anxiety disorders; neuroimaging studies of anxiety disorders; developmental neurobiology and childhood onset of psychiatric disorders; the neurobiology of mental retardation; the interface between neurological and psychiatric disorders; the neurobiology of circadian rhythms; and the neurobiology of sleep disorders. Both as a textbook and a reference work, Neurobiology of Mental Illness represents a uniquely valuable resource for psychiatrists, neuroscientists, and their students or trainees.},

We have climbed the highest mountains; the deepest ocean won't go unexplored for long. We have ventured into the most impenetrable jungles. There are few, if any, ecosystems left untouched.},

	abstract = {Like Toronto's Spadina Museum, this 1840s mansion was bequeathed intact to the city (Hamilton, in this case) after being occupied by three generations of a single family for 116 years. Home to the distinguished McQuesten clan, this Georgian beauty with an antebellum flavour boasts a grand portico of white Ionic columns; the outer wings are overhung with ancient trees. Tours begin on the second floor, where guests are treated to a detailed family saga reminiscent of an Edith Wharton novel. Photos mounted on a family tree-storyboard enhance the anecdotes; one in particular, a sepia-toned photograph of a generation of McQuesten daughters holding new dolls in 1882, prefaces a peek at the preserved collection, dulled by time yet still enchanting. Unlike many historic homes, Whitehern has not been restored to a specific time period, resulting in a vibrant interior where Victorian, Edwardian and 1930s deco coexist spectacularly. One most impressive feature is a long, curved flash glass window presiding over the sweeping main staircase. Installed between 1860 and 1870, its simple red and blue design casts a glow over the amber woodwork, richly patterned carpeting and wallpaper. The most charming upstairs bedchamber is the girls' room, haven for the Miss McQuestens past, one of whom was a talented watercolourist: the cabbage rose-papered walls are almost entirely obscured by her pretty still lifes. On the main floor, the drawing room is a time capsule, hardly altered for over a century. As in two of the other rooms, a 1907 photo hung in the entrance lets visitors study the similarities (there have been amazingly few alterations). The basement level, which once housed the old-fashioned kitchen, was converted in 1937 into Tom's Lounge, a haven for the most celebrated member of the family: politician and public benefactor Tom McQuesten. Along with the original kitchen hearth and bake oven rest dozens of mementoes of Tom's public life, including a pair of grand chairs once used by the late Queen Mum and King George VI, and a suite of furnishings in vivid 1930s chenille upholstery. In addition to tours, Whitehern hosts a roster of events, including Edwardian garden parties, movie nights, antique collectors' month, an Easter egg hunt, a trick-or-treater's day at Halloween, and a host of Christmas celebrations, when rooms are festooned with ornaments.              This converted barn-cum-curiosity shop, nestled in a stand of pines near Creemore, boasts a rarefied collection of chi-chi antiques amassed by Lindsay Bell and Wayne Winters. Brand name-dropping is the order of the day here: original signed Tiffany, Handel and Pairpoint lamps are \$2,000 to \$60,000; antique chandeliers (in bronze or brass), some with Steuben or Lotz shades, range from \$2,000 to \$5,000; signed art-glass vases and lampshades in iridescent blues, golds and creams by Steuben, Tiffany and Quezal date from 1900 to 1925 and are priced between \$500 and \$7,000. French furniture has a strong presence on the main floor, with dining tables in walnut, pine or mahogany dating from 1850 to 1880 (\$1,000-\$4,000) and French armoires (\$5,000-\$12,000) being standout examples. To represent England, there are 19th-century walnut and rosewood credenzas (\$2,000-\$6,000) and matted botanical prints (\$75-\$175). Upstairs, find a selection of harvest tables (\$1,000-\$3,500) and country armoires (\$1,000-\$5,000). Cast iron fencing and estate gates are priced from \$500 to \$2,500. Summer customers are welcome to enjoy a picnic lunch on the grounds and take advantage of stone benches set in the shade.},

When the ships dump their ballast in the Great Lakes, they also dump the alien species.                 Some introduced species have been devastating. The United States and Canada spend about \$15 million US a year to control the lamprey, a snakelike bloodsucker that attaches itself to larger fish. The lamprey almost drove the native lake trout to extinction when it first expanded into the Great Lakes, said Kolar.                 Kolar said understanding which fish could represent threats to the Great Lakes could help policy-makers draw up new regulations controlling ballast dumping by ships. Right now, ships bound for the Great Lakes are required to make a mid-ocean exchange of ballast water, a measure aimed at reducing the transfer of alien species. More stringent measures may need to be considered, she said.},

	abstract = {Figurative images have long played a critical, if largely unexamined, role in Africa--mediating relationships between the colonizer and the colonized, the state and the individual, and the global and the local. This pivotal volume considers the meaning and power of images in African history and culture. Paul S. Landau and Deborah Kaspin have assembled a wide-ranging collection of essays dealing with specific visual forms, including monuments, cinema, cartoons, domestic and professional photography, body art, world fairs, and museum exhibits. The contributors, experts in a number of disciplines, discuss various modes of visuality in Africa and of Africa, investigating the interplay of visual images with personal identity, class, gender, politics, and wealth.

Integral to the argument of the book are over seventy contextualized illustrations. Africans saw foreigners in margarine wrappers, Tintin cartoons, circus posters, and Hollywood movies; westerners gleaned impressions of Africans from colonial exhibitions, Tarzan films, and naturalist magazines. The authors provide concrete examples of the construction of Africa's image in the modern world. They reveal how imperial iconographies sought to understand, deny, control, or transform authority, as well as the astonishing complexity and hybridity of visual communication within Africa itself.},

	abstract = {As an association, founded four years ago by Ruth Barrett, we have made a concerted effort to educate our members in managing weeds throughout the summer. Elevated phosphorous levels must be reduced by discouraging the use of fertilizers and naturalizing cottage shorelines that can filter phosphorous runoff. We all need to do this, not just a few of us. Members have also been encouraged to lift weeds on their shoreline simply to reduce organic nutrient with the hope that reduced organic material will reduce weed growth. Lifting the weeds is certainly not a pleasant task and for a few weeks seems never-ending due to the prevailing winds. However, for some residents along part of the south shore of Lovesick Lake it has been discouraging and hard work but it is the responsible action.},

This year alone, at least 370 cases of West Nile disease have been confirmed across North America and at least 16 people have died from it.

This is a journey through the economic world of Africa--an account, often in their own words, of Africans who achieved success, wealth, and recognition in their own homelands and how they did it. Entrepreneur Dave Fick interviewed several hundred women and men who were willing to assume risks, often spectacular ones, for personal economic gain--but who did it legally, ethically, and who are now giving back to their nations and societies at least as much as they received. They speak openly of their hardships and failures, what they did right and what they did wrong, and their accounts are remarkable.; We gain insight into the way business must be done under harsh political and economic circumstances, but we also learn unusual techniques and strategies that others in more favorable milieus can use to accomplish similar feats: With commentaries from notable scholars and other businesspeople and with Fick's own first-hand onsite observations, the book is a self-educating colloquiem, a collection of personal meetings, accounts, letters, emails and telephone calls between Fick, his counterparts in Africa, and others around the world. It is also an attempt to encourage a dialogue that will accelerate the exchange and spread of knowledge and ideas, and a way to help the people of Africa build a peaceful and better society for themselves and the world.},

	abstract = {Only two decades ago, the Millcroft Inn stood abandoned on the banks of the Credit River. Since the former knitting mill's conversion to a high-end country inn, people have raved about its industrial-age architecture and fine cuisine. Accommodations are spread among three buildings: the historic Mill, the Crofts (recently renovated suites feature walkout patios, some with hot tubs) and the gracious old red-brick Manor House. All rooms are lovely enough to snuggle up the whole weekend long, but if you're so inclined, opportunities for adventure abound in the surrounding countryside. In summer, colourful hot-air balloons launch in the early morning or evening from Millcroft's grounds and drift along in the westerly breeze (note: balloons fly only in ideal conditions). Staying on the ground, though, has its rewards, including a hike along the network of trails criss-crossing the inn's 100-acre grounds. Golfers have their choice of the Caledon Country Club or Osprey Valley Golf Course; the latter now offers 52 holes of championship golf. In recent years, the Millcroft's rooms have been rejuvented: while the outlying Crofts building boasts a more contemporary feel with loft-style bedrooms, the guest rooms in the main Mill have been redecorated in keeping with a more traditional look. Nine of the 10 rooms in the Manor have a Jacuzzi.              Accommodation: reservations essential during Gemboree. Teddy Bear Bed and Breakfast provides rollaway beds for kids and has its own private beach (26541 Hwy. 62, 613-332-4678). Iron-wood Hill Inn offers B\&B-style accommodations in a two-storey log house surrounded by woods and gardens (32172 Hwy. 62 N., 613-338-2032). More upscale is the Brides' Gate Inn and Grail Springs Spa (2004 Bay Lake Rd., 1-877-553-5772, www.grailsprings.com) on Spurr Lake, south of Bancroft. Guest rooms feature four-poster beds, fireplaces and balconies.              Accommodation: Tin Goose Inn (1060 East-West Rd., 519-724-2223, www.goose. on.ca) has eight themed guest rooms and four suites; reservations for summer weekends should be made at least two months in advance. Or try the Gathering Place (933 West Shore Rd., 519-724-2656) and Stonehill (911 West Shore Rd., 519-724-2193.) If you prefer to stay on the mainland, try Erie Shores Bed and Breakfast in Leamington (280 Robson Rd., 519-326-2936).},

	abstract = {Orientalist Poetics is the only book on literary orientalism that spans the nineteenth century in both England and France with particular attention to poetry and poetics. It convincingly demonstrates orientalism's centrality to the evolution of poetry and poetics in both nations, and provides a singularly comprehensive and definitive analysis of the aesthetic impact of orientalism on nineteenth-century poetry. Because it examines the poetry of the entire century across both national literatures, the book is in a unique position to articulate the essential part orientalism plays in major developments of nineteenth-century poetics. Through probing discussions of an array of prominent nineteenth-century poets-including Shelley, Southey, Byron, Hugo, Musset, Leconte de Lisle, Wordsworth, Hemans, Gautier, Tennyson, Arnold and Wilde-Emily A. Haddad reveals how orientalism functions as a diffuse avant-garde, a crucial medium for the cultivation and refinement of a broad range of experimental positions on poetry and poetics. Haddad argues that while orientalist poems are often viewed mainly as artefacts of European attitudes towards the East and imperialism, poetic representations of the Islamic Orient also provide an indispensable matrix for the reexamination of such aesthetically fundamental issues as the purpose of poetry, the value of mimesis, and the relationship between nature and art. Orientalist Poetics effectively bridges the gap between the analysis of poetics and the analysis of orientalism. In showing that major poetic developments have roots in orientalism, Haddad's book offers a valuable and innovative revisionist view of nineteenth-century literary history.},

This collection of women's travel writing dispels the notion by showing how there are few corners of the world that have not been visited by women travellers.

Life is never dull for her intrepid women, whether diving to the bed of the Timor Sea or reaching the summit of Annapurna. From an encounter with a snake in the Amazon jungle to shipwreck and kidnap on the Barbary Coast, there are tales of adventure, derring-do, and great danger. There are alsomoving accounts of unimaginable hardship, includingcaring for a family in an ammunition cart during the siege of Delhi and a journey through Tibet that leaves its author childless and widowed.There is no such thing as a typical woman traveller--and there never has been--as this exhilarating anthology shows on a journey of its own through sixteen centuries of travel writing, aboard almost anything from a Bugatti to a Bath chair. You are taken as far afield as it is possible to go, in the company of some of the most extraordinary characters you are ever likely to meet.},

Being a weekday would certainly have had an effect on the amount of anglers fishing that day. This is still one of the best-kept secrets around the Great Lakes.

To each his own, but as far as I am concerned he should look for another occupation.

Soft plastic grubs, tubes and four-inch plastic worms were extremely productive. Suspending Rogue Minnowbaits and Spinnerbaits were the ticket for covering shallower water.

Early in 1999, a housing project began construction on the headwaters of the creek. Trees were removed and the flow was channelled. As a result, the gravel bed where the trout spawned in October of 1998 no longer exists. Its canal-like appearance looks uniform and appealing to anybody that wouldn't understand the intricacy of a fragile natural ecosystem. In the parkland downstream water temperatures increased. The shade provided by the trees is missed. Traditionally flowing clear, any rainwater now brings a deadly load of silt and mud.

	abstract = {This stately limestone structure traces its history back to 1845, when it was erected to house the Kingston branch of the Bank of Montreal. In 1905, abandoned by bankers, the building was joined with an adjacent residence to form an elite men's club, with such trailblazers as Alexander Graham Bell and American poet Carl Sandburg signing the guest book. A stint as an apartment block sent it into a state of decline in the late 20th century. Then, in 1997, Toronto couple Beare Weatherup and Susan Shaw purchased the property and began renovations, opening last summer as a nine-room bed and breakfast, replete with leather club chairs and restored bank vault to invoke the building's virile history. The theme permeates the guest rooms, which subscribe to a smart, unfussy sensibility (they're spacious, too, many with 12-and-a-half-foot ceilings). A sage-green corner suite (all rooms are colour coded, from brick red to periwinkle blue) overlooks downtown church steeples and the night-lit St. George's dome; it's also one of two rooms with a Jacuzzi. The Blue room, with but a shower, compensates with a view of Lake Ontario--and the passing Wolfe Island ferry--framed by the house's two chimneys. Architecture buffs with an appetite for history can scan the upper hallway for limestone blocks with cylindrical cutouts that once housed old stovepipes, or the panel of electrical fuses that must be one of the oldest remaining in Ontario. A downside for those who like to unwind in typical men's club fashion: the billiards room has been transformed into a modest kitchen area, where breakfast is served from 8:30 to 9:30 daily. Typical fare is fresh fruit and a  [Not Transcribed]  or similar egg dish prepared by Weatherup himself.              Maryanne Baker greets guests with tea, coffee, lemonade and hot cider in winter, served in the parlour with freshly baked cookies and squares. Her 1888 red-brick Queen Anne-style house has been architecturally preserved, from the plaster cornices and stained-glass windows to the original mahogany fireplaces. Each of the Kingston inn's six guest rooms has a distinct flavour. Vacationers can relax on the two Chinese Chippendale wingback chairs amid the pale gold and russet tones of the Victoria rose room. City dwellers who crave extra breathing space tend to prefer Theresa's room, with its Waverly peacock draperies, a king-size walnut four-poster with knotted-lace canopy, gas fireplace and two wing chairs arranged in the window well for rainy-day reading. The Turret room is the only one with a shower stall instead of a tub, but to compensate it boasts a corner fireplace and pretty sitting nook with wicker furnishings in the turret. Antiques connoisseurs will appreciate the few notable pieces scattered throughout the rooms: the Secret Garden room claims an early-20th-century French dresser (here, as the name suggests, a private deck overlooks the garden). A mahogany buffet carved in a pineapple motif fits under the stained-glass windows of the oak-panelled dining room, where a set breakfast (eggs Benedict, vegetable quiche or French toast stuffed with cream cheese and apples) is served at tables flattered by lace linens and ornate silverware.              Accommodation: reservations are essential during the Gemboree. Teddy Bear Bed and Breakfast provides rollaway beds for kids and has its own private beach (26541 Hwy.62, 613-332-4678). Ironwood Hill Inn offers comfortable B\&B-style accommodation in a two-storey log house surrounded by woods and gardens (32172 Hwy. 62, 613-338-2032). For something more upscale, try the Brides' Gate Estate Inn and Spa (2004 Bay Lake Rd., 1-877-553-5772, www.bridesgate.com) on Spurr Lake, south of Bancroft. The five-room inn's pine-panelled interior fits the rugged landscape. A new spa is expected to be completed early this spring, and eight new guest rooms are planned for the fall.},

	abstract = {Clearly, the popular fish need a chance to bounce back to the levels we have become accustomed to, until recently. And so, the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources slashed the number of walleye that both sport and commercial fishermen can catch in the eastern end of Lake Erie. Commercial fishermen saw the total drop from nearly 41,000 kilograms to 14,500. At the same time, sport anglers saw their daily limit drop from six fish to four.


Quite simply, this group takes so few of the total number of fish caught, its impact on the population is minimal. In 1999, sport anglers took only 1.3 per cent of all the walleye caught in Lake Erie. By comparison, Ontario's commercial fisheries hauled in 72 per cent. (The balance was caught by a combination of anglers from Ohio, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania.)},

	abstract = {In this ground-breaking study, John Dryzek argues that democratic theory is now dominated by a deliberative approach. As one of those responsible for this turn, John Dryzek now takes issue with the direction it has taken. Discussing the models of democracy advocated by both friends and critics of the deliberative approach, Dryzek shows that democracy should be critical of established power, transitional in extending beyond national boundaries, and dynamic in its openness to changingconstraints upon and opportunities for democratization. - ;The past few years have seen a remarkable ferment in the theory of democracy. Deliberative Democracy and Beyond builds on a critical tour through recent democratic theory by one of the leading political theorists in the field. It examines the deliberative turn in democratic theory, which argues that the essence of democratic legitimacy is to be found in authentic deliberations on the part of those affected by a collective decision. The deliberative turn began as a challenge toestablished institutions and models of democracy, but it has now been largely assimilated by these same institutions and models. Drawing a distinction between liberal constitutionalist deliberative democracy and discursive democracy, the author criticizes the former and advocates the latter. He arguesthat a defensible theory of democracy should be critical of established power, pluralistic, reflexive in its questioning orientation to established traditions, transnational in its capacity to extend across state boundaries, ecological, and dynamic in its openness to ever-changing constraints upon and opportunities for democratization. Dryzek's reinvigorated approach enables deliberative democracy to respond more effectively to the criticisms that have been leveled against it. - ;Remarkable book ... Dryzek's discussions are unfailingly lucid, and his critical assessments of the literature remain comprehensive and illuminating ... Readers will find much to ponder in what he has to say. - Ethics;The most remarkable and subtle part of Dryzek's argument is his attempt to construct green theory of democratic communication, which takes account of agency and communication in the non-human natural world ... The argument is a bit like crossing a ravine on a bridge of eggshells, and is conducted with considerable intellectual excitement ... Dryzek's discussion is throughout careful, rigorous, detailed, and in dealing with views from which he distinguishes his own position,scrupulously sympathetic. - Democratizaton;This clear and imaginative presentation of recent attempts to make democracy more inclusive than traditional liberal models bounded by the institutions of the state is highly recommended for collections serving upper-division undergraduates, graduate students, and researchers. - Choice;Dryzek is a sharp and authoritative critic, and this will be an influential work ... even the sceptical will do well to engage closely with Dryzek's provocative vision. - Political Studies},

Ignorance about water has led to disasters on both sides of the border. In May 1997, this city of 700,000 people barely escaped the disastrous Red River flood that severely damaged Grand Forks, N.D., 240 kilometres south of here. Winnipeg, built on an ancient flood plain, was saved only by a diversion canal built after a 1950 flood. Before reaching the canal, the Red River flooded 2,590 square kilometres of Manitoba farmland, damaging hundreds of houses and forcing the removal of 25,000 people.                 The solution, North Dakota officials contend, is to hasten a spillover by building a 11-kilometre drainage channel to the floodwaters' natural destination, the Sheyenne River in the Red River basin. To ease Manitoba's fears of flooding, North Dakota would agree, in writing, not to release water during flood times downstream.},

In the 1970s the headlines screamed Lake Erie was dead after Cleveland's polluted Cuyahoga River actually burned and phosphorous- fed algae were choking the lake. A huge mercury spill in Lake St. Clair, also in the 1970s, helped spark environmental controls.


Lake Ontario: Contaminant worries are PCBs, mirex, dioxins, furans.... PCB levels dropped five-fold from where they were in 1970s, DDTs no longer a problem.... In 1976, 65-cm rainbow trout had PCB level of four parts per million, today 0.6.... Mirex levels were two parts per million in '76, now 0.6.... Average rainbow trout now safe to eat.},

But there was no school in K-W to challenge mentally handicapped children and allow them to exceed expectations of the day.                 The McQuarries pushed for a special school. Sponsored by Kitchener Kinsmen clubs and run by the Kitchener Association for the Mentally Retarded, the McQuarrie school opened on Queen's Boulevard, Kitchener, in 1966, according to school board records. The Waterloo County board of education brought the school under the board's authority in 1969.                 Attitudes about educating the mentally handicapped were changing. "The (old) attitude seemed to be, 'Don't let them out into the community," said Don Jardin, McQuarrie principal from 1972-82. "Some schools had built play areas for mentally handicapped children. They screened them in. . . . Our philosophy was, 'Let's introduce these people to the community. They'll eventually have to live in the community.' "},

	abstract = {As Nixon's unpopularity increased during Watergate, his nose and jowls grew to impossible proportions in published caricatures. Yet the caricatures remained instantly recognizable. Caricatures can even be superportraits, with the paradoxical quality of being more like the face than the face itself. How can we recognize such distorted images? Do caricatures derive their power from some special property of a face recognition system or from some more general property of recognition systems? What kind of mental representations and recognition processes make caricatures so effective? What can the power of caricatures tell us about recognition? In seeking to answer these questions, the author assembles clues from a variety of sources: the invention and development of caricatures by artists, the exploitation of extreme signals in animal communication systems, and studies of how humans, other animals and connectionist recognition systems respond to caricatures. Several conclusions emerge. The power of caricatures is ubiquitous. Caricatures can be superportraits for humans, other animals and computer recognition systems. They are effective for a variety of stimuli, not just faces. They are effective whether objects are mentally represented as deviations from a norm or average member of the class, or as absolute feature values on a set of dimensions. Exaggeration of crucial norm-deviation features, distinctiveness, and resemblance to caricatured memory traces are all potential sources of the power of caricature. Superportraits will be of interest to students of cognitive psychology, perception, the visual arts and animal behavior.},

Since the smokestacks have never been equipped with scrubbers, the plant continues to contribute to acid rain and urban smog. In 1985, houses and cottages along the shore were coated with sooty ash from the station and three years later Hydro was fined \$4,000 for that act of pollution.

Such as the visit in To The Last Drop to the giant storage tunnels beneath the streets of Chicago that receive excess sewage flow during rainstorms, preventing the untreated flushings of the Windy City from spilling into Lake Michigan.},

The document -- which condemns chemical use as immoral and unethical -- warns there is "mounting evidence" of dire health effects from exposure to persistent toxic chemicals. And it urges immediate and radical action to protect the species, including a sweeping strategy to eliminate all discharges of persistent toxic chemicals and a phased ban on chlorine, one of society's most common chemicals. Among the human health effects the IJC suggests may be linked to Great Lakes' chemicals:                 "If the question is: 'Do human beings respond to exposure to toxic chemicals?' the answer is, 'Yes, they do'," says Doug Haffner, head of the Great Lakes Institute at the University of Windsor.

	abstract = {Human activities are progressively threatening the "renewability" of this most essential resource.  Pollution is making more and more freshwater sources unusable.  Human - induced climate change threatens to alter the hydrological cycle, with effects ranging from reducing the amount of fresh - water stored as ice to accelerating the process of desertification in many parts of the globe.  The burgeoning human population is causing over - consumption of water stored in even the largest aquifers.  Many fear that this situation will worsen -- conceivably to the point that water will become economically more precious than gold and its scarcity the cause of numerous wars between nations competing for the same limited sources.


Many of these countries are also tapping alternate sources of water for human and economic use: desalinating salt water, tapping into fossil water supply (a non - renewable source found in very deep aquifers), and using waste water for agricultural purposes.  But all of these sources come with high costs.  Desalination is extremely energy intensive; only those nations with their own abundant supply of oil can afford desalination plants.  Fossil water extraction, besides being non - renewable, threatens the geologic stability of the entire Middle East -- the ground level may actually drop as the aquifers are emptied. Waste water used for irrigation can cause crops to carry human diseases.


The North American Water and Power Alliance (NAWAPA), is a corporate proposal to provide American water from Alaska to the thirsty states in the U.S. southwest.  The proposal calls for a series of dams and pipelines that would essentially reverse the flow of many of the northern rivers in B.C. to flood the Rocky Mountain trench and take the "excess" water in the Mackenzie and Yukon rivers south to California. The plan includes the flooding of a number of communities along the way, but this was written off as the price of progress in the heyday of unlimited growth.},

	abstract = {To start with, the MNR's main stocking efforts are aimed at rebuilding Lake Huron's lake trout population. It's an admirable plan, but it should have been started years ago. The years of stocking hybrid lake trout (speckled-lake trout cross), commonly referred to as splake or backcrosses, proved to be an exercise in futility. The MNR now says that most stockings will now be pure lake trout.                 What's not addressed in the FCO is, how can we possibly hope to rebuild Lake Huron's lake trout population when commercial fishing and the growing lamprey population aren't being seriously addressed in the objectives? These were the two major factors that lead to the earlier demise of lake trout in the lake.                 Under the Anishinabek Conservation and Fishing Agreement of the draft, it states that one of the elements that may be addressed in such an agreement is jurisdiction (ownership). This is in total contradiction to the previous discussions between the MNR and the Union of Ontario Indians (UOI). During these discussions, in which the OFAH and the Ontario Fish Producers were involved, it was decided that jurisdiction would remain under government control.},

The result has been a morass of R\&D incentives, a slew of failed industrialization projects, precious little diversification, and a cost to taxpayers in the tens of billions.  Government industrial policies are undeniably a competitive factor, but usually a negative one.  Canada's recent past is dotted by cases of taxpayer-funded boondoggles.  Rationalizations for such expenditures range from the increasing competition or complexity of the global economy to the notion that the sweeping economic changes are too profound to be handled by the private sector alone, all of which are spurious arguments.  The best hope for global economic growth is to negotiate level playing fields in both trade and investment.  Critical areas for Canadian government action are the national debt, internal economic barriers, and education shortcomings.},

	abstract = {In the radical era, 1985 to 1988, Environment Minister Jim Bradley ordered cuts of 60 per cent in Ontario's acid rain emissions, brought in the ''spills bill'' that made industry responsible for spilled waste, and made jail sentences possible for polluters. His ministry hired a scientist who was fired by Environment Canada for speaking out publicly against traces of toxic residue in food and mothers' milk.  It ordered refineries to formulate gasoline differently in summer to reduce smog.              The water pollution campaign, MISA, fell two years behind schedule under the Liberals and is still stalled today.  It has ordered nine industrial sectors \_ steel mills, pulp mills, chemical plants, and oil refineries and others \_ to analyse their waste water for one year as a first step.  But it hasn't ordered any actual cleaning.              Activists are hoping that an environmental bill of rights and a toxic waste strategy will emerge soon.  They say the ministry still has time to choose between looking after toxic waste and greenhouse gases, which threaten the whole planet, or regulating sawdust and pop cans.},

	abstract = {ALONG WITH poor hatches in 1987, 1988, and 1989, there's a series of other pressures ganging up on the perch. An intruder species from the U.S. eastern seaboard, the white perch, is competing with the tastier yellow perch for food and space in the lake. At the same time, government policies to promote the sports fishery have maintained a healthy population of pickerel - a species sought by both sports and commercial anglers, and one that feeds on the smaller yellow perch.              "You probably can't have large populations of both perch and walleye," said Roger Knight, a fisheries biologist with the Ohio State fisheries research station in Sandusky, Ohio. Knight argues government policies on both sides of the lake - but especially in U.S. waters - have encouraged the maintenance of pickerel, a species valued by U.S. sports fishermen. Because the pickerel feed on young perch, Knight said they help depress perch numbers.

He gives us a broad array of engaging (and often eccentric) characters: from Harrision Gray Otis to Helen Hunt Jackson to Cecil B. DeMille. Whether discussing the growth of winemaking or the burgeoning of reform movements, Starr keeps his central theme in sharp focus: how Californians defined their identity to themselves and to the nation.},
