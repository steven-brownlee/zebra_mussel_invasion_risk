	abstract = {As the potential applications of DNA diagnostics continue to expand, there is a need for improved methods and standards for DNA analysis. This report describes several methods that could be considered for the production of reference materials for the quantitative measurement of DNA damage in mammalian cells. With the focus on DNA strand breaks, potentially useful methods for assessing DNA damage in mammalian cells are reviewed. The advantages and limitations of each method, as well as additional concerns with respect to reference material development, are also discussed. In conclusion, we outline strategies for developing candidate DNA damage reference materials that could be adopted by research laboratories in a wide variety of applications.},

	abstract = {C1q domain-containing proteins (C1qDC proteins) unexpectedly turned out to be widespread molecules among a variety of invertebrates, despite their lack of an integral complement system. Despite the wide distribution in the genomes of various invertebrates, data on the structure and properties of the isolated and characterized C1qDC proteins, which belong to the C1q/TNF superfamily, are sporadic, although they hold great practical potential for the creation of new biotechnologies. This review not only summarizes the current data on the properties of already-isolated or bioengineered C1qDC proteins but also projects further strategies for their study and biomedical application. It has been shown that further broad study of the carbohydrate specificity of the proteins can provide great opportunities, since for many of them only interactions with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) was evaluated and their antimicrobial, antiviral, and fungicidal activities were studied. However, data on the properties of C1qDC proteins, which researchers originally discovered as lectins and therefore studied their fine carbohydrate specificity and antitumor activity, intriguingly show the great potential of this family of proteins for the creation of targeted drug delivery systems, vaccines, and clinical assays for the differential diagnosis of cancer. The ability of invertebrate C1qDC proteins to recognize patterns of aberrant glycosylation of human cell surfaces and interact with mammalian immunoglobulins indicates the great biomedical potential of these molecules.},

However, it is crucial to understand whether they adequately contribute to our essential nutritional needs. Small amounts of essential metals are indispensable in the human body to proper physiological functioning; their deficiency can manifest in various sets of symptoms that can only be eliminated with their intake during treatment or nutrition. However, the excessive consumption of metals can induce undesirable effects, or even toxicosis. Shellfish, oyster, and squid samples were collected directly from a fish market. After sample preparation, the concentration of essential metals (cobalt, chromium, copper, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, and zinc) was detected by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry. The results were analyzed statistically using ANOVA and two-sample t-tests. The average concentration of the investigated essential elements and the calculated burden based on the consumption were below the Recommended Dietary Allowances and Tolerable Upper Intake Levels. Based on these results, the trace element contents of the investigated seafoods do not cover the necessary recommended daily intake of them, but their consumption poses no health hazard due to their low levels.},

Negative allometry was determined in the W/L relationship of P. rhomboides. The main meat component of P. rhomboides was moisture (54.70-65.57\%) and protein (52.89-62.10\%) with the other components being carbohydrate (1 0.95-21.30\%), lipid (1 2.79-1 7.1 8\%) and ash (7.69-1 9.93\%). The correlation between moisture and carbohydrate was positive, whereas the correlation between moisture and protein was negative (p {\textless} 0.05).

	doi = {10.1186/s12864-023-09536-6},
	abstract = {In recent years, some common themes in the development of sex-specific traits in different animal lineages have started to emerge since the discovery of the Dmrt (doublesex-mab3-related transcription factor gene) genes. Bivalves are characterized by a diversity of sexual systems, including simultaneous hermaphroditism, sequential hermaphroditism, and strict gonochorism. However, to date, no research has focused on the genome-wide characterization and analysis of Dmrt genes in bivalves. In this study, the identification and analysis of Dmrt genes in 15 bivalves were performed using bioinformatics methods. A total of 55 Dmrt genes were retrieved in the studied bivalve genomes. The number of Dmrt genes in different species ranged from 3 to 5. The phylogenetic tree showed that Dmrt genes in bivalves can be subdivided into 5 classes: the Dmrt2-like class, Dmrt3-like class, Dmrt4/5-like class, Dsx-like class, and scallop-specific Dmrt class. The Ka/Ks ratios suggested that all Dmrt classes underwent purifying selection pressure. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal expression of Dmrt genes in four bivalve species suggested that different Dmrt genes may have different functions, and scallop-specific Dmrt genes may play a key role in sex determination/differentiation. In general, this study provides a molecular basis for in-depth examination of the functions of Dmrt genes and phylogenomic analyses in bivalves.},

	abstract = {Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs) are a family of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) involved in host antibacterial responses, and their functions have been characterized in most invertebrate and vertebrate animals. However, little information is available regarding the potential function of PGRPs in the giant triton snail Charonia tritonis. In this study, a short-type PGRP gene (termed Ct-PGRP-S1) was identified in C. tritonis. Ct-PGRP-S1 was predicted to contain several structural features known in PGRPs, including a typical PGRP domain (Amidase\_2) and Src homology-3 (SH3) domain. The Ct-PGRP-S1 gene was constitutively expressed in all tissues examined except in proboscis, with the highest expression level observed in the liver. As a typical PRR, Ct-PGRP-S1 has an ability to degrade peptidoglycan (PGN) and was proven to have non-Zn2+-dependent amidase activity and antibacterial activity against Vibrio alginolyticus and Staphylococcus aureus. It is the first report to reveal the peptidoglycan recognition protein in C. tritonis, and these results suggest that peptidoglycan recognition protein Ct-PGRP-S1 is an important effector of C. tritonis that modulates bacterial infection resistance of V. alginolyticus and S. aureus, and this study may provide crucial basic data for the understanding of an innate immunity system of C. tritonis.},

	abstract = {Memory retrieval does not provide a perfect recapitulation of past events, but instead an imperfect reconstruction of event-specific details and general knowledge. However, it remains unclear whether this reconstruction relies on mixtures of signals from different memory systems, including one supporting general knowledge. Here, we investigate whether the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) distorts new memories due to prior category knowledge. In this experiment (N=36), participants encoded and retrieved image-location associations. Most images' locations were clustered according to their category, but some were in random locations. With this protocol, we previously demonstrated that randomly located images were retrieved closer to their category cluster relative to their encoded locations, suggesting an influence of category knowledge. We combined this procedure with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered to the left ATL before retrieval. We separately examined event-specific details (error) and category knowledge (bias) to identify distinct signals attributable to different memory systems. We found that TMS to ATL attenuated bias in location memory, but only for atypical category members. The magnitude of error was not impacted, suggesting that a memory's fidelity can be decoupled from its distortion by category knowledge. This raises the intriguing possibility that retrieval is jointly supported by separable memory systems.

	abstract = {The spread of aquatic invasive species typically occurs through a combination of natural and human mediated dispersal. For many aquatic invasive species, natural dispersal is limited to aquatic corridors connecting habitat. In contrast, human transport may facilitate more distant dispersal and transport among disconnected waterbodies. Genetic information can serve as a powerful tool to track invasion histories and identify both the sources and mechanisms of invasive species dispersal. We used genetic information to understand invasion history and dynamics of expanding northern pike invasion in the Columbia River basin. Results indicate that the initial introduction of northern pike into the Pend Oreille River (in eastern Washington State) resulted from human transport of fish, not dispersal from established populations upstream. Subsequent reproduction and natural dispersal from the Pend Oreille River resulted in downstream expansion of northern pike into Lake Roosevelt, a reservoir within the mainstem Columbia River. These results highlight the need for a holistic approach to suppression of invasive species. Immediate efforts must address the biological mechanisms of natural dispersal. Sustained suppression and eradication must take a broad approach that includes coordination between management agencies, as well as policy and public outreach aimed at prevention of repeated human transport events. The genetic database created from this study has already been used to eliminate potential source populations for new northern pike invasions in Washington State outside the Columbia River basin. This highlights the utility of genetic monitoring for both immediate and long-term applications to managing aquatic species invasions.},

	abstract = {For any prey animal, avoiding and fleeing from predators is one of the most important tasks in the key to survival. In order to avoid predation, a prey on detecting the predator must make appropriate decisions on how to respond to the threat. According to the optimal escape theory, initiation of escape should be a balance between the costs of staying (such as predation risk or death) and costs of fleeing (such as loss of feeding and reproductive opportunities and energy expenditure). Camouflage, particularly background matching, is also an important and widespread antipredator strategy, and it is commonly predicted that the likelihood of fleeing from a predator should depend on the level of camouflage of a prey animal. Moreover, most organisms encounter multiple predators rather than a single predator. Each predator possesses a different visual system and demonstrate various means of foraging and capture behaviour. Consequently, it becomes difficult for the prey to use the same antipredator strategy for multiple predators so prey species may evolve to form predator-specific responses as a counter strategy. Although a number of recent studies have considered the camouflage aspect in the common shore crab, research on how it works in combination with escape behaviour and whether it is affected by the type of predator remains unanswered. Although the association between camouflage strategies and escape behaviour has been researched in the past literature, many of these studies focus on the vertebrate taxa or do not directly measure camouflage and only few of them explore multiple predators. Within this thesis, I aim to address these gaps through a series of field-based experiments using background and predator treatments in the common shore crab (Carcinus maenas).In chapter 2, I investigate the effects of camouflage on the escape response of shore crabs using mismatched backgrounds. Individuals were placed on the mismatched backgrounds and exposed to predator treatment and control of no predator treatment. The camouflage of crabs was measured in terms of brightness and colour difference using image analysis. Predator and background independently rather than their interaction had a significant influence on the escape behaviour. However, brightness and colour difference did not significantly affect their flight response. In addition, I also examined the effects of camouflage using substrate heterogeneity on the escape response of these crabs. Here, the camouflage based on brightness difference affected their escape behaviour on interaction with predator and substrate. Colour difference alone had a significant effect on the fleeing times and the interaction between predator and substrate was also found to be significant.In chapter 3, I explore whether the escape responses of shore crabs are tailored to the type of predators using the same camouflage metrics. Here, predator and background when considered independently were found significant. Additionally, size of crabs was also significantly influencing the escape behaviour of crabs. Overall, this thesis indicates that camouflage influences the escape behaviour of prey species in complex heterogenous environments. Furthermore, it suggests that crabs and possibly other marine animals are capable of distinguishing between different predators and alter their escape responses based on the level of perceived threat.},

	abstract = {Despite its recognized importance, significant areas of wetland habitat have been lost. With that loss, there has been a decline in native species and the functions they provide. One solution to overcome this loss of both organisms and functions has been restoration. My study assessed paired oyster and eelgrass restoration through response of fish and epifaunal invertebrates. Olympia oysters (Ostrea lurida) and eelgrass (Zostera marina) were restored, separately and paired, at four sites in Newport Bay, CA in 2016 and 2017. I monitored fish communities using baited camera traps and epifauna using oyster bed excavations (OSUs) for 3-years post-complete restoration. I hypothesized that both fish and epifaunal invertebrate abundance and diversity within restored habitats would increase through time due to maturation of structure-forming habitats of the oyster beds and eelgrass. Although site remained an important factor influencing the fish and epifauna communities, it is likely that this is due to variation in the restoration trajectory of the oyster beds and eelgrass at each site. Immediately post-restoration, one site, Shellmaker, was most often distinct from other sites due to its lack of eelgrass. As time progressed, the beds at Shellmaker remained most intact but eelgrass beds did develop. This meant that site differences remained for epifaunal invertebrates but fish communities reflects the treatments (mainly eelgrass presence). While additional monitoring is needed both on these communities and for other abiotic correlates, the restoration of oysters and eelgrass in a paired design appears to positively affect the fish and epifaunal communities within this southern California estuary over a 3-year time scale.},

	abstract = {The homogenization of freshwater ecosystems and their biological communities has emerged as a prevalent and concerning phenomenon because of the loss of ecosystem multifunctionality. The millions of prairie-pothole wetlands scattered across the Prairie Pothole Region (hereafter PPR) provide critical ecosystem functions at local, regional, and continental scales. However, an estimated loss of 50\% of historical wetlands and the widespread conversion of grasslands to cropland make the PPR a heavily modified landscape. Therefore, it is essential to understand the current and potential future stressors affecting prairie-pothole wetland ecosystems in order to conserve and restore their functions. Here, we describe a conceptual model that illustrates how (a) historical wetland losses, (b) anthropogenic landscape modifications, and (c) climate change interact and have altered the variability among remaining depressional wetland ecosystems (i.e., ecosystem homogenization) in the PPR. We reviewed the existing literature to provide examples of wetland ecosystem homogenization, provide implications for wetland management, and identify informational gaps that require further study. We found evidence for spatial, hydrological, chemical, and biological homogenization of prairie-pothole wetlands. Our findings indicate that the maintenance of wetland ecosystem multifunctionality is dependent on the preservation and restoration of heterogenous wetland complexes, especially the restoration of small wetland basins.},

	abstract = {The ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes (Belarus) includes three water bodies, Lake Batorino, Lake Myastro and Lake Naroch. These lakes have a common catchment area. At the end of the 80 s, the ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes underwent a transformation, during which the nutrient load on the catchment area decreased, and the concentration of phosphorus as a limiting factor in these water bodies decreased significantly. At the same time, the Naroch Lakes were exposed to zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas) invasion. In the mid-90 s, the biological and hydrochemical characteristics of the ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes stabilized. We show here that complex processes associated with the transformation of the lake ecosystem and affecting both trophic interactions in the Naroch Lakes and the influence of environmental factors on them can be represented using a single parameter, the phase-locking index, PLI. In this case, a statistically significant numerical value of PLI characterizes the phase synchronization of two processes, oscillations of the concentration of total phosphorus, TP, and oscillations of the concentration of chlorophyll, Chl. We show that the phase synchronization of these processes occurs only after the stabilization of the ecosystem of the Naroch Lakes. In the period preceding the transformation of the lake ecosystem, there was no synchronization. Numerical evaluation of PLI as a holistic parameter allows us to characterize the transformation of the lake ecosystem as a whole without resorting to study of complex interactions of various factors involved in this transformation.},

	abstract = {Novel methods for species detection based on collection of environmental DNA (eDNA) are not only important in biodiversity assessment in a scientific context, but are also increasingly being applied in conservation practice. The eDNA-based biodiversity detection methods have significant potential for regular use in biodiversity status assessments and conservation actions in protected areas (PAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) worldwide. Species detection based on DNA from environmental samples, such as water, sediment, soil, air, or organic material, has a broad application scope with precise, comprehensive, and rapid species identification. Here, we provide an overview of the application range of eDNA-based methods for biodiversity monitoring in PAs, evaluate environmental assessments in which this technology has already been implemented for nature conservation, and examine the challenges that can hamper further application in real world practice. Based on the outcomes of two projects, practical experience, and current scientific literature focusing on their application, we conclude that eDNA-based species detection methods provide promising novel approaches that have strong potential as supplement methods, or in some cases even as substitutes for the conventional monitoring methods used for PAs. This advancement is expected to affect decision-making in biodiversity conservation efforts in PAs and OECMs.},

	abstract = {In dimictic lakes, the stable density stratification during summer and winter inhibits vertical mixing of nutrients and oxygen. This favors the development of hypolimnetic hypoxia, which degrades cool-water fish habitat and enhances nutrient mineralization and diffusion from the sediments. Fall turnover began once the entire water column become nearly isothermal (within 0.4 °C) at the deepest point of the lake and continued to the onset of winter stratification. Similarly, spring turnover began when the water column became nearly isothermal (within 0.4 °C) and continued until the average water column temperature reached 4.0 to 4.5 °C. Fall and spring turnover events, therefore, provide a crucial bi-annual link between surface and bottom waters. Long-term field observations were supplemented with output from a three-dimensional numerical model, to better understand the hydrodynamics of turnovers and associated dissolved oxygen (DO) and orthophosphate (PO4) dynamics within a small temperate lake during 2011 to 2020. Mid-basin convection contributed the most to turnover events. During fall turnover, wind shear only mixed the upper 35\% of the surface mixed layer, with convection acting to deepen below. During spring turnover, ice-cover sheltered the lake from wind, causing convection to be the only process occurring and lengthening the turnover duration ({\textasciitilde}51 days) compared to fall ({\textasciitilde}13 days).Photosynthetic production was modelled to contribute 92\% of the total dissolved oxygen (DO) input to the lake, the remaining 8\% was from atmospheric exchange. Of the DO production, 41\% occurred under ice with a potential to contribute 17±11\% of the hypolimnetic DO saturation deficit at spring turnover. The occurrence of spring turnover depended on the winter conditions. Warm winters caused a weak inverse stratification that shortened the deepening of the convective mixed layer (CML) under the ice and inhibited spring turnover induced mixing of DO into the hypolimnion. Conversely, cold winters caused an inverse stratification in which watercolumn became isothermal after the CML deepened and removed the stratification. Then, the incoming heat from the surface caused large vertical convections (spring turnover). Severe winters form a very strong inverse stratification that limits the effectiveness of spring turnover.Mineralization was the main PO4 source producing with 77-98\% of the annual internal load. The remaining PO4 (2-23\%) was from anoxic sediments. Fall turnover upwelled the trapped PO4 from hypolimnion into the photic zone where it could initiate the spring algal bloom. The bloom was postponed because phytoplankton was mixed to depth with fall turnover mixing events, where their growth was light limited until the seasonal increase in solar radiation in spring.},

	abstract = {The ecological quality of freshwater ecosystems is endangered by various micropollutants released into the environment by human activities. The cumulative effects of these micropollutants can affect the fitness of organisms and populations and the functional diversity of stream ecosystems. In this study, we investigated the relationships between the joint toxicity of micropollutants and trait syndromes. A trait syndrome corresponds to a combination of traits that could occur together in communities due to the trait selection driven by exposure to these micropollutants. Our objectives were to (i) identify trait syndromes specific to diatom, macroinvertebrate, and fish assemblages and their responses to exposure, taking into account four micropollutant types (mineral micropollutants, pesticides, PAHs, and other organic micropollutants) and nine modes of action (only for pesticides), (ii) explore how these syndromes vary within and among the three biological compartments, (iii) investigate the trait categories driving the responses of syndromes to micropollutant exposure, and (iv) identify specific taxa, so-called paragons, which are highly representative of these syndromes. To achieve these objectives, we analyzed a dataset including the biological and physico-chemical results of 2007 sampling events from a large-scale monitoring survey routinely performed in French wadeable streams. We have identified five (diatoms), eight (macroinvertebrates), and eight (fishes) trait syndromes, either positively or negatively related to an increasing toxicity gradient of different clusters of micropollutant types or modes of action. Our analyses identified several key trait categories and sets of paragons, exhibiting good potential for highlighting exposure by specific micropollutant types and modes of action. Overall, trait syndromes might represent a novel and integrative bioassessment tool, driven by the diversity of trait-based responses to increasing gradients of micropollutant toxic cocktails.},

Although many advocate for deliberative democracy as a pathway toward natural resource sustainability, others remain skeptical due to perceived tradeoffs. Environmental deliberative democracy (EDD) serves as a conceptual synthesis of collaborative principles. This research compares the social, economic, and political discourses in two Wisconsin watersheds (Geneva Lake in regulatory compliance and Green Lake, which is deemed state impaired) and posits that EDD community compatibility is enhanced by public trust in expert capacity and accessible watershed education resources. A mixed methodology is used to analyze quantitative data from citizen surveys and qualitative interview responses. Findings affirm that proactive watershed management frameworks are stronger when not prompted by environmental crises. Management programs created reactively with a specific agenda have a comparable structure with citizen involvement but have a limited capacity, scope, and potential for sustained success.},

	abstract = {Background
The characterisation of functional traits of non-indigenous and invasive species is crucial to assess their impact within invaded habitats. Successful biological invasions are often facilitated by the generalist diet of the invaders which can modify their trophic position and adapt to new ecosystems determining changes in their structure and functioning. Invasive crustaceans are an illustrative example of such mechanisms since their trophic habits can determine important ecological impacts on aquatic food webs. The Atlantic blue crab Callinectes sapidus is currently established and considered invasive in the Mediterranean Sea where it has been recorded for the first time between 1947 and 1949. In the last decade, the blue crab colonised most of the eastern and central Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea and it is currently widening its distribution towards the western region of the basin.

There have been multiple round goby diet studies from both the Baltic Sea and the North American Great Lakes where they are similarly invasive. However, studies that quantify their effects on recipient ecosystems and, specifically, their impacts on the benthic invertebrate macrofauna are rare, particularly from European waters. In this study, we conducted the first before-after study of the potential effects of round goby on benthic invertebrate macrofauna taxa in marine-brackish habitats in Europe, focusing of two sites in the Western Baltic Sea, Denmark. Results were in line with those from the Great Lakes, indicating negative impacts on specific molluscan taxa (e.g. Cardiidae bivalves and Neritidae gastropods, which both showed a fall in detected densities of approximately 98\% within the Guldborgsund Strait). In contrast, many other groups appeared to be largely unaffected or even show positive trends following invasion. Round goby gut content data were available at one of our study sites from the period immediately after the invasion. These data confirmed that round goby had in fact been preying on the subset of taxa displaying negative trends.},

The impacts of invasive alien species (IAS) on the environment are well known, however, economic impacts are poorly estimated, especially in mega-diverse countries where both economic and ecological consequences of these effects can be catastrophic. Ecuador, one of the smallest mega-diverse countries, lacks a comprehensive description of the economic costs ofIASwithin its territory. Here, using "InvaCost", a public database that compiles all recorded monetary costs associated withIASfrom English and Non-English sources, we investigated the economic costs of biological invasions. We found that between 1983 and 2017, the reported costs associated with biological invasions ranged between US\$86.17 million (when considering only the most robust data) and US\$626 million (when including all cost data) belonging to 37 species and 27 genera. Furthermore, 99\% of the recorded cost entries were from the Galapagos Islands. From only robust data, the costliest identified taxonomic group was feral goats (Capra hircus; US\$20 million), followed by Aedes mosquitoes (US\$2.14 million) while organisms like plant species from the genus Rubus, a parasitic fly (Philornis downsi), black rats (Rattus rattus) and terrestrial gastropods (Achatina fulica) represented less than US\$2 million each. Costs of "mixed-taxa" (i.e. plants and animals) represented the highest (61\% of total robust costs; US\$52.44 million). The most impacted activity sector was the national park authorities, which spent about US\$84 million. Results from robust data also revealed that management expenditures were the major type of costs recorded in the Galapagos Islands; however, costs reported for medical losses related to Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue fever in mainland Ecuador would have ranked first if more detailed information had allowed us to categorize them as robust data. Over 70\% of theIASreported for Ecuador did not have reported costs. These results suggest that costs reported here are a massive underestimate of the actual economic toll of invasions in the country.},

	abstract = {Reliable, inexpensive, and publicly accessible decontamination techniques are needed for equipment used in waters infested with aquatic invasive species. One such aquatic invasive species is the faucet snail (Bithynia tentaculata) that hosts several parasitic trematodes which have caused mass waterfowl die-offs in the United States and Canada. We examined freezing as a potential decontamination method using a household chest freezer. Snails were frozen in time increments of 0, 5, 10, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min in dry conditions (water removed) and in water. Snails in dry conditions reached 100\% mortality after 30 min while snails in water reached 80\% mortality after 240 min. Snail mortality was inversely related to size, with larger snails requiring longer times to achieve mortality. Snails in water could tolerate freezing temperatures longer than snails in dry conditions. We determined that freezing is a viable decontamination method for contaminated equipment, but longer freezing times will be necessary for larger snails, especially when equipment is wet.},

	abstract = {Ecological performance of animals depends on physiological and biochemical processes that are adjusted to the environment. The responses to hypoxia or anoxia have been frequently studied in subterranean aquatic organisms in order to find potential adaptations to restrict oxygen conditions occurring in the underground habitats. However, some previous studies have compared phylogenetic distant epigean and hypogean species or the epigean and hypogean populations of the same species due to little chance to compare closely related epigean and hypogean species. Therefore, in this study, we compared the effects of exposure to hypoxia, followed by reoxygenation, and increased temperature on oxygen consumption, potential metabolic activity, and antioxidant activities in closely related epigean and hypogean species: Niphargus zagrebensis and N. stygius. Oxygen consumption of N. stygius increased similarly during post-hypoxic recovery at 10 and 20°C (approx. 5-times), while N. zagrebensis increased its oxygen consumption for 9.7 and 4.4-times at 10 and 20°C, respectively. We observed higher exploitation of metabolic potential for current oxygen consumption during reoxygenation in N. zagrebensis than N. stygius. Exposure to hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation at 20°C increased catalase (CAT) activity in N. stygius, but not in N. zagrebensis. We observed increased glutathione reductase activity in both Niphargus species. We concluded that respiratory and antioxidant responses to severe hypoxia and increased temperature differed between closely related epigean and hypogean Niphargus species. Hypogean Niphargus species possess physiological and biochemical characteristics that are advantageous in temperature stable subterranean environments which support inhabiting of species that have low energetic demands, while epigean Niphargus species can successfully inhabit specific surface habitats.},

Nile tilapia also has become invasive in areas of suitable climate when escaped from aquaculture facilities to the wild.

Due to its very variable landscape, the climate of Georgia fluctuates from cold mountainous to humid subtropical type.

This paper responds to the urgent call for the inclusion of the IAS topic in education through the development, implementation and evaluation of novel and user-friendly educational materials. The aim of this paper is to describe best practices in IAS education and to share the lessons learned from eight educational projects from seven different countries. We discuss four challenges for IAS education, related to (1) inconsistent and ambiguous terminology, (2) communicating risk, (3) implementation of education materials, and (4) evaluation of learning effects. Examples of best practices are the use of smartphone applications and gaming elements, place-based education and exhibitions. We also note the importance of open access publishing of education materials to make them easily available. We intend this discussion to serve as a source of inspiration to researchers, science communicators and teachers and to spur the development of new teaching materials worldwide.},

	abstract = {The present study reports the first comprehensive study on the freshwater macroinvertebrates and its habitat preferences in Bilah River, the largest river in the Northern Sumatra. The riverside is characterized by the presence of anthropogenic and industrial activities which may alter the macroinvertebrate assemblage and biodiversity. Five months of investigation on 10 sampling stations from December 2016 to October 2017 were conducted based on the river flow in Bilah River. Principal component analysis indicated a decrease of trophic status from upstream to downstream of the river. A total of 27 taxa were recorded, with the most abundant group were members of Odonata, Gastropoda, and Decapoda. The highest density of macroinvertebrate was observed from station 1 (160 ind'm'2), while the lowest density was observed from station 9 (38.64 ind'm2). Based on species distribution and similarity, two groups of habitats may be distinctively recognized based on the Bray-curtis similarity coefficient. Group 1 consisted of station 1, 2, 3 and 4 while group 2 consisted of station 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Based on the diversity indices as ecological parameters, the habitat condition in Bilah River was categorized from low to moderately polluted. Spatial patterns in both environmental conditions affecting the macroinvertebrate assemblage was observed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed the preferences from each macroinvertebrate species towards environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Being able to associate an organism with a scientific name is fundamental to our understanding of its conservation status, ecology, and evolutionary history. Gastropods in the subfamily Physinae have been especially troublesome to identify because morphological variation can be unrelated to interspecific differences and there have been widespread introductions of an unknown number of species, which has led to a speculative taxonomy. To resolve uncertainty about species diversity in North America, we targeted an array of single-locus species delimitation methods at publically available specimens and new specimens collected from the Snake River basin, USA to generate species hypotheses, corroborated using nuclear analyses of the newly collected specimens. A total-evidence approach delineated 18 candidate species, revealing cryptic diversity within recognized taxa and a lack of support for other named taxa. Hypotheses regarding certain local endemics were confirmed, as were widespread introductions, including of an undescribed taxon likely belonging to a separate genus in southeastern Idaho for which the closest relatives are in southeast Asia. Overall, single-locus species delimitation was an effective first step toward understanding the diversity and distribution of species in Physinae and to guiding future investigation sampling and analyses of species hypotheses.},

	abstract = {The Eurasian collared dove (Streptopelia decaocto) is an invader species, and its distribution is continuously on the increase. Today its expansion has spread to the American continent. In this study we describe the effects of the urban environment on the Eurasian collared dove in eastern Spain. The abundance and presence of this dove were analyzed in 46 localities using counting points. Overall, 220-point counts were surveyed between autumn 2015 and late-winter 2016. A hierarchical partitioning analysis was used to identify explanatory variables of different types such as resources, climate and urban structure, and human presence, which may influence the presence and abundance of this species. In the case of presence, the number of town inhabitants, parks, mean minimum temperature, exotic vegetation and schools had a positive association, while pedestrian number and restaurants had a negative association. Abundance was positively related to native vegetation, exotic vegetation, and water, while urban area was negatively associated with it. Exotic vegetation was the only variable that has a positive relation to presence and abundance. These results can help to predict the use of urban habitats in potential localities for its invasion. Alternate abstract: La tórtola turca (Streptopelia decaocto) es una especie invasora y su ámbito de distribución aumenta continuamente. Hoy en día, su expansión incluye el continente americano. En este estudio se describen los efectos que el ambiente urbano tiene sobre la tórtola turca en el este de España. Se muestrearon 46 localidades mediante puntos de conteo. La abundancia de la tórtola turca fue evaluada en 220 puntos de conteo entre otoño de 2015 y finales de invierno 2016. Se utilizó el análisis de partición jerárquica para identificar variables explicativas como recursos, clima y estructura urbana, y presencia humana, que pueden influir en su presencia y abundancia. En el caso de la presencia de la especie, el número de habitantes de la ciudad, parques, temperatura media, vegetación exótica y colegios tuvieron una asociación positiva, mientras que el número de peatones y los restaurantes estuvieron negativamente asociados. La abundancia estuvo positivamente relacionada con la vegetación nativa, vegetación exótica y el agua, mientras que la zona urbana estuvo negativamente asociada. Estos resultados pueden predecir el uso de hábitats urbanos en localidades potenciales para su invasión.},

With high clearance rates, the unionid rapidly removed Microcystis cells within 24 h, but only a small amount of carbon and nitrogen were incorporated into the tissues. Even with the low assimilation rates, the mussels showed more favorable uptake of carbon than of nitrogen from toxic Microcystis water, and of tissues, the gills and gut accumulated more carbon and nitrogen than the muscle and mantle. Collectively, our findings indicate that although Unio douglasiae effectively uptake toxic Microcystis cells, they can assimilate only low amounts of nutrients into tissues within three days, despite a non-flowing system.},

	abstract = {Global change is the origin of increased occurrence of disturbance events in natural communities, with biological invasions constituting a major threat to ecosystem integrity and functioning. The apple snail (Pomacea maculata) is a freshwater gastropod mollusk from South America. Considered one of the 100 most harmful invasive species in the world, due to its voracity, resistance, and high reproductive rate, it has become a global problem for wetland crops. In Catalonia, it has affected the rice fields of the Ebre Delta since 2010 with significant negative impact on the local economy. As a gastropod mollusc it possesses statocysts consisting of a pair of sacs, one located on each side of the foot, that contain multiple calcium carbonate statoconia. This study shows the first ultrastructural images of pathological changes in the sensory epithelium of the statocyst of apple snail adults with an increase in the severity of the lesions over time after exposure to low frequency sounds. Sound-induced damage to the statocyst could likely result in an inhibition of its vital functions resulting in a potential reduction in the survival ability of the apple snail and lead to an effective mitigation method for reducing damage to rice fields.},

Specifically, pesticide runoff can disrupt hormonal, reproductive, and developmental processes in aquatic organisms, yet non-point source pollution is difficult to trace and quantify. In Oregon, U.S.A., state and federal forestry pesticide regulations, designed to meet regulatory water quality requirements, differ in buffer size and pesticide applications. We deployed passive water samplers and collected riverine and estuarine bivalves Margaritifera falcata, Mya arenaria, and Crassostrea gigas from Oregon Coast watersheds to examine forestry-specific pesticide contamination. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling and regression to relate concentrations and types of pesticide contamination across watersheds to ownership and management metrics. In bivalve samples collected from eight coastal watersheds, we measured twelve unique pesticides (two herbicides; three fungicides; and seven insecticides). Pesticides were detected in 38\% of bivalve samples; and frequency and maximum concentrations varied by season, species, and watershed with indaziflam (herbicide) the only current-use forestry pesticide detected. Using passive water samplers, we measured four current-use herbicides corresponding with planned herbicide applications; hexazinone and atrazine were most frequently detected. Details about types and levels of exposure provide insight into effectiveness of current forest management practices in controlling transport of forest-use pesticides.},

The research was conducted in 47 lakes with different trophic conditions in the middle of summer. Samples were collected close to the deepest part of the lakes to avoid the diverse benthic and littoral zones. We found 119 zooplankton species of which 32 were Cladocera, 16 were Cyclopoida, 4 were Calanoida, and 67 were Rotifera. We determined which species occurred most frequently in the region, as well as the species that were characteristic of different trophic conditions. We also recorded the presence of eight cold-adapted species which some of them are considered as glacial relicts (e.g., Eurytemora lacustris, Heterocope appendiculata, Cyclops lacustris). Our research revealed potential glacial refugia for planktonic species in 14 lakes of NE Poland. Our study suggests that the presence of stenotherm species may be an excellent indicator of the ecological status of deep lakes and could be considered in lake monitoring programs. Furthermore, we did not find Bythotrephes longimanus which has been reported from Poland. Instead, we found that B. brevimanus was the most common representative of the genus in the study area.},

Translocation and captive management are commonly used to mitigate losses of freshwater mussel biodiversity, but these conservation tools may result in decreased growth and increased mortality. This study uses RNA-Seq to determine how translocation into captivity affects gene expression in Amblema plicata. Mussels were collected from the Muskingum River in Ohio, USA and brought into a captive holding facility. RNA was extracted from gill tissue 11 months post translocation from mussels in captivity and the Muskingum River on the same day. RNA was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500, and differential expression analysis was performed on de novo assembled transcripts. More than 1200 transcripts were up-regulated in captive mussels, and 246 were assigned functional annotations. Many up-regulated transcripts were involved in energy metabolism and the stress response, such as heat shock proteins and antioxidants. More than 500 transcripts were down-regulated in captive mussels, and 41 were assigned functional annotations. We observed an over-representation of down-regulated transcripts associated with immune response. Our work suggests that A. plicata experienced moderate levels of stress and altered energy metabolism and immune response for at least 11 months post translocation into captivity.},

	abstract = {Freshwater mussels of the order Unionida are a widely distributed taxon that are important in maintaining freshwater ecosystems and are also highly imperiled throughout the world. Monitoring of mussel populations with environmental DNA (eDNA) is an attractive alternative to traditional methods because it is noninvasive and requires less labor and taxonomic knowledge from field personnel. We developed eDNA metabarcoding assays specific to freshwater mussels and tested them at six sites in the Clinch River, located in the southeastern United States. Our objective was to determine the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for future monitoring of mussel populations and restoration efforts in this watershed. Two metabarcoding assays that target the mitochondrial DNA regions of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit (ND1) genes were developed and tested. Our assays appear to be order specific, amplifying members from the two families found in North America, Unionidae and Margaritiferidae, while not amplifying nontarget fish or other bivalve species. From the field collected samples, our assays together detected 19 species, eight of which are listed as federally endangered. The assays also detected 42\%, 58\%, and 54\% of the species identified by recent quantitative visual mussel surveys at three sampling sites. Increased sampling effort by processing a greater water volume or number of samples will likely increase species detections. These eDNA metabarcoding assays may enable enhanced monitoring of freshwater mussel assemblages and subsequently inform conservation efforts.},

Additionally, the suitability of marbled crayfish as a model organism for endemic freshwater crayfish was established when studying the effects of Diclofenac. For both species, lethal effects started at concentrations of 10.24 mg/L Diclofenac, weight was not affected, embryonic development slowed down from concentrations of 0.16 mg/L and histological changes were visible from concentrations of 0.64 mg/L.

	abstract = {Background 
The Yancheng coastal natural wetlands (YCNR) are well-preserved silty tidal flat wetlands in China. Due to the severe invasion of Spartina alterniflora, the native ecosystem has undergone great changes. The successful invasion of S. alterniflora reduced the biodiversity of the YCNR, changed the structure and function of the local ecosystem, and eventually led to the degradation of the ecosystem and the loss of ecosystem function and service. Fully understanding the impact of an alien species invasion on YCNR succession is an important prerequisite for protecting and restoring the wetlands.
Methods
In this study, remote sensing, GIS technology, and a cellular-automaton Markov model were used to simulate the natural succession process of native ecosystems without being affected by alien species. By comparing the landscape of the YCNR with the model simulation results, we gained a better understanding of how alien species affect native landscape-scale ecosystems.

Highly productive salt marshes at the interface of terrestrial and marine systems have the potential to support megafauna species, but a recent global meta-analysis of consumer-plant interactions in marshes found few studies investigated impacts of wild megafauna. We conducted a literature review to document the variety of megafauna in salt marshes and found that 34 species utilize salt marshes, including sharks, manatees, pinnipeds, crocodilians, sea otters, hippos, and large terrestrial animals, such as lions, bears and water buffalo. The use of salt marsh habitats by a variety of megafauna may have implications for both the conservation of these large consumers and for the resilience of coastal wetlands through stabilizing feedbacks on plant ecosystems. Future studies should quantify the occurrence and impacts of megafauna in salt marshes, and how their conservation can help restore these valuable ecosystems.},

However, there is a lack of knowledge in its native range where it supports an increasing commercial harvest pressure. Among Asiatic countries, China accounts for 70\% of known commercial harvest and aquaculture production. We aim to characterize here wild C. fluminea s.l populations exposed to commercial harvest pressure in Poyang Lake Basin. We found higher biomass, density and genetic diversity in lake populations compared to peripheral populations (i.e., lake tributaries). Given that lake habitats support more intense harvest pressure than peripheral habitats, we suggest that demographic and genetic differentiation among subpopulations may be influenced in some degree by different harvest pressure. In this regard, additional demographic and/or genetic changes related to increasing harvest pressure may place population at a higher risk of extirpation. Altogether, these results are especially relevant for maintaining populations at or above viable levels and must be considered in order to ensure the sustainability of the resource.},

	abstract = {The anthropogenic transfer of non-indigenous marine species (NIMS) into new areas of the oceans is a key issue. Despite increasing research effort in recent years many fundamental questions remain to be answered before we can effectively manage the issue. One question is whether the greater number of NIMS thus far documented in temperate waters is real or an artefact of fewer surveys being undertaken in tropical environments. Another one is whether poor taxonomic knowledge of the biodiverse tropics hides NIMS that actually occur there. Extensive taxonomic work in three Pacific localities (Guam, northern Western Australia and Singapore) has been collated in previous papers showing that there are relatively few NIMS in these biodiverse environments. The present paper replicates investigations for a low latitude environment in southern Florida in the Atlantic Ocean. The focus area includes the extensive Florida Keys coral reef environment, the southern margin of the Everglades on Florida Bay and the major PortMiami. Only 48 NIMS were identified in a literature-based compilation of 4,615 species; 15 species were represented by isolated records and have not established populations, leaving only 33 NIMS that are established or whose status is unknown. Records for Mollusca, the group with the most species (1,153) in the compilation, were individually researched and taxonomically verified. It is argued that the relative paucity of NIMS is not a straightforward temperature-driven tropical/temperate issue, but instead there are biological factor(s) restricting the ability of NIMS to colonise biodiverse environments compared to less diverse areas.},

	abstract = {Indo-Pacific lionfish have become invasive throughout the western Atlantic. Their predatory effects have been the focus of much research and are suggested to cause declines in native fish abundance and diversity across the invaded range. However, little is known about their non-consumptive effects, or their effects on invertebrates. Lionfish use shelters on the reef, thus there is potential for competition with other shelter-dwelling organisms. We demonstrate similar habitat associations between invasive lionfish, native spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus) and native long-spined sea urchins (Diadema antillarum), indicating the potential for competition. We then used a laboratory experiment to compare activity and shelter use of each species when alone and when lionfish were paired with each native species. Spiny lobsters increased their activity but did not change their shelter use in the presence of a lionfish, whilst long-spined sea urchins changed neither their activity nor shelter use. However, lionfish reduced their shelter use in the presence of spiny lobsters and long-spined sea urchins. This study highlights the importance not only of testing for the non-consumptive effects of invasive species, but also exploring whether native species exert non-consumptive effects on the invasive.},

	abstract = {Eutrophication affects many lakes and reservoirs worldwide. It is caused by excessive amounts of nutrients entering waterbodies from their catchments, mainly due to human activity. The main sources of these nutrients are discharges from industry and wastewater treatment systems, and agricultural runoff. The water quality problems caused by eutrophication, such as harmful algal blooms, affect the sustainable use of lakes for agriculture, fisheries, recreation, tourism and water supply. They also degrade habitat quality and threaten biodiversity. A range of methods for improving lake water quality are explored, including catchment management and in-lake restoration measures. The potential impacts of these on lake biodiversity are explored, including species interactions and ecosystem feedbacks that may confound the recovery process. A particular challenge is the fact that achieving sustainable recovery may take many years, mainly due to the impact of legacy pollution problems. This must be taken into account when planning and implementing eutrophication management options, because these slow recovery periods can exceed the timescales that people are willing to accept. While this review focuses on the many well documented studies of restoration and recovery processes in temperate lakes, it also highlights the need for similar research on tropical and sub-tropical systems.},

Because eDNA sampling and analysis is noninvasive, it improves the detection of threatened, invasive, and exploited species for which monitoring may be challenging. Species detection efforts using a combination of eDNA and qPCR have been highly successful and, as a result, their use in species monitoring is expanding rapidly. We developed qPCR primers and probes in order to monitor many invasive, threatened, or exploited aquatic species as part of various monitoring eDNA projects in the province of Québec, Canada. Here, we present a total of 60 species-specific qPCR assays (including PCR protocols, primers, and TaqMan probes sequences) developed for the detection of 45 fishes, six amphibians, five reptiles, two mollusks, and two crustaceans. These comprised nine and 27 species, respectively, listed as invasive and threatened in Eastern Canada. These resources should be of broad usefulness not only for monitoring studies based in Québec but throughout the geographic range of the targeted species in North America.},

In this study, we designed and/or optimized species-specific qPCR assays for 9 marine invertebrates considered invasive in Eastern Canada for use in conjunction with environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling. All qPCR assays showed high analytical sensitivity with theoretical limit of detection (LOD) ranging from 0.045 to 9.24 picogram (pg) of DNA. Comparison of two eDNA water sampling methods showed an increased detection sensitivity using the grab sample approach. eDNA AIS detections were also compared to results obtained using a traditional in situ biofouling monitoring method (i.e., biofouling monitoring lines), and a high concordance between the two was observed. We also determined temporal variability in the amount of DNA found in the environment for some of the targeted AIS, which will help target seasonal monitoring efforts. The results provided herein clearly demonstrate the usefulness of including eDNA for early AIS detection in ongoing monitoring, rapid response investigations and mitigation/eradication efforts.},

Although the snail has already been documented as surviving the digestive tract of various fish, there is insufficient data on potential riverine fish predators of P. antipodarum and of the ability of the snail to survive digestion by these fish. Lotic ecosystems are unfavourable for the upstream spread of this species by active movement and thus it is suspected that benthivorous riverine fish facilitate such upstream dispersion. In general, the results of this study indicated that P. antipodarum is not a preferable food object for the studied riverine fish. The study did indicate, however, that the invasive snail is capable of surviving the digestive tract of all the studied fish. As accidental consumption of abundant P. antipodarum with other food objects has already been documented, this study suggests that riverine fish can act as potential secondary dispersion vectors, facilitating the upstream dispersion of the snail.},

	abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted from water samples has recently shown potential as a valuable source of population genetic information for aquatic macroorganisms. This approach offers several potential advantages compared with conventional tissue-based methods, including the fact that eDNA sampling is noninvasive and generally more cost-efficient. Currently, eDNA approaches have been limited to single-marker studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and the relationship between eDNA haplotype composition and true haplotype composition still needs to be thoroughly verified. This will require testing of bioinformatic and statistical software to correct for erroneous sequences, as well as biases and random variation in relative sequence abundances. However, eDNA-based population genetic methods have far-reaching potential for both basic and applied research. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the achievements of eDNA-based population genetics to date, and outline the prospects for future developments in the field, including the estimation of nuclear DNA (nuDNA) variation and epigenetic information. We discuss the challenges associated with eDNA samples as opposed to those of individual tissue samples and assess whether eDNA might offer additional types of information unobtainable with tissue samples. Lastly, we provide recommendations for determining whether an eDNA approach would be a useful and suitable choice in different research settings. We limit our discussion largely to contemporary aquatic systems, but the advantages, challenges, and perspectives can to a large degree be generalized to eDNA studies with a different spatial and temporal focus.},

	abstract = {Human-assisted transport via recreational boats and trailers is thought to account for most contemporary movement of aquatic invasive species (AIS) among lakes. The ability of invasive macrophytes to survive out of water, that is, their desiccation tolerance, is an important indicator of capacity for spread to new water bodies through overland transport. Invasion by the alga starry stonewort (Nitellopsis obtusa [Desv. in LoiseL] J. Groves; Characeae) in North America is likely driven via overland transport, but little is known regarding its ability to remain viable out of water. We conducted laboratory and outdoor experiments to evaluate desiccation tolerance of starry stonewort propagules, including single stem fragments, small and large clumps of fragments, and bulbils (asexual reproductive structures). Propagules were removed from water for 15 min to 5 d to identify desiccation thresholds. Fully desiccated fragments and clumps lost {\textasciicircum}90\% of their original mass and bulbils {\textgreater}60\% of original mass. Based on the most conservative estimates from our experiments, starry stonewort was no longer viable at 2 h for single fragments, 24 h for small (5-g) clumps, 4 d for large (45-g) clumps, and 4 h for bulbils. Overall, starry stonewort appears less tolerant of desiccation than other invasive macrophytes that have been evaluated, which comprise vascular plants rather than Characean algae. Widely adopted guidance that boats should dry on land for 5 d to prevent AIS spread should suffice to prevent most starry stonewort spread between water bodies, given that boaters comply with inspection protocols and remove large, readily detected clumps.},

In mainland Portugal, the main tourist region is the Algarve, where beach tourism, known as sun and sea tourism, plays a decisive role. However, this activity also has its negative impacts. In the present work, a case study was analyzed, at Praia da Cova Redonda, located in the parish of Porches, in the municipality of Lagoa. Negative impacts on land use and occupation were identified, caused by the excessive presence of people, the introduction of invasive species and the artificial filling of beaches. At the end, a set of mitigating measures are presented that aim to ensure that the exploitation of natural resources can be maintained, but in a perspective of preservation and recovery of natural resources and biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Understanding phenotypic plasticity of species at different spatial scales is vital in the current context of an increasing pace of environmental changes. Through this knowledge, it is possible to predict their potential to adapt and/or evolve in face of new environmental conditions such as climate change, and/or to understand their ecological range expansion. In Patagonian rocky salt-marshes, one of the most abundant invertebrate species is the scorched mussel Perumytilus purpuratus. In this system, this mussel can be found inhabiting both vegetated and non-vegetated patches, which differ in critical environmental conditions. We performed a field study evaluating whether mussels growing in vegetated patches differ in shell shape from those growing in adjacent non-vegetated patches. We sampled individuals from both patch types and assessed their shell shape and size using geometric morphometrics. The results showed that mussels from vegetated patches had shells that were more dorsoventrally expanded, anterodorsally restricted and globose in shape than those from non-vegetated patches, which showed the opposite traits resulting in a more elongated shell. The differences found could be driven by the different conditions of temperature, desiccation rate, wave action and population density to which mussels are exposed in each patch type. These results revealed the striking phenotypic plasticity of shell form of this native species at a fine-grained scale, which could be one of the explanations for its success in its ecological range expansion.Alternate abstract: 
Poder comprender la plasticidad fenotípica de las especies, a diferentes escalas espaciales, es fundamental en un contexto de crecientes cambios ambientales. A través de este conocimiento, es posible predecir su potencial para adaptarse y/o evolucionar frente a nuevas condiciones ambientales tales como el cambio climático, y/o entender el modo en el que se expanden o expandieron sus rangos ecológicos. En las marismas rocosas patagónicas, una de las especies de invertebrados marinos más abundantes es el mejillín Perumytilus purpuratus. En este sistema, se lo encuentra en parches vegetados y sin vegetación que difieren en condiciones ambientales críticas. Mediante un estudio a campo, evaluamos si los mejillines que crecen en parches vegetados difieren en la forma de la concha de aquéllos que crecen en parches adyacentes sin vegetación. Para ello, se colectaron individuos de ambos tipos de parches y se evaluó la forma y el tamaño de las valvas utilizando morfometría geométrica. Los resultados mostraron que los mejillines de parches con vegetación presentan conchas más expandidas dorsoventralmente, con restricción anterodorsal, generando una forma globosa en comparación con la de los individuos de parches sin vegetación. Las distintas formas encontradas podrían deberse a las diferentes condiciones de temperatura, desecación, acción de las olas y densidad poblacional a las que están expuestos los mejillines en cada tipo de parche. Estos resultados muestran la presencia de plasticidad fenotípica en la forma de las valvas de esta especie nativa a una microescala espacial, lo que explicaría el éxito de esta especie en su expansión hacia nuevos ambientes.},

	abstract = {Rapid range expansions of invasive species are a major threat to ecosystems. Understanding how invasive species increase their habitat ranges and how environmental factors, including intensity of human activities, influence dispersal processes is an important issue in invasion biology, especially for invasive species management. We have investigated how spatially heterogeneous factors influence range expansion of an invasive species by focusing on long-distance dispersal, which is frequently assisted by human activities. We have developed models varying two underlying processes of a dispersal event. These events are described by source and destination functions that determine spatial variations in dispersal frequency and the probability of being a dispersal destination. Using these models, we investigated how spatially heterogeneous long-distance dispersal influences range expansion. We found that: (1) spatial variations in the destination function slow down late population dynamics, (2) spatial variations in the source function increase the stochasticity of early population dynamics, and (3) the speed of early population dynamics changes when both the source and the destination functions are spatially heterogeneous and positively correlated. These results suggest an importance of spatial heterogeneity factors in controlling long-distance dispersal when predicting the future spread of invasive species.},

Likewise, the management of IAS represents a clear socio-scientific issue (SSI), which gives greater interest to its inclusion in school. At this point, future teachers play a key role, so that their knowledge, perceptions and attitudes on the subject must be evaluated. In order to deal with this objective, a questionnaire was filled out by 400 students of the degrees in early childhood education and primary education of the Universities of La Rioja (UR) and the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Spain. Our results show that pre-service teachers do not perceive impacts of different types generated by IAS, and they show a clear lack of knowledge about transmission vectors. Likewise, they do not support various control measures, especially slaughter of invasive vertebrates, related to affective dimensions. These results highlight the need to work toward an appropriate integration of this issue at different educational levels, training students and educators, fostering favorable attitudes toward a sustainable management of IAS.},

Conclusions
Dispensable genes usually belong to young and recently expanded gene families enriched in survival functions, which might be the key to explain the resilience and invasiveness of this species. This unique pan-genome architecture is characterized by dispensable genes in accessory genomic regions that exceed by orders of magnitude those observed in other metazoans, including humans, and closely mirror the open pan-genomes found in prokaryotes and in a few non-metazoan eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {The assessment and characterization of emerging and legacy contaminants occurrence and distribution in coastal freshwater systems is often complex and challenging. As these compounds are detected in various coastal environmental matrices, their persistence and toxicological endpoints creates growing concern and their potential risks warrant added assessment of their likely drivers and sources. In this study, a suite of legacy (historical) and emerging contaminants were assessed and characterized at select Great Lakes National Centers for Coastal Ocean Science (NCCOS) Mussel Watch Program (MWP) sites based on a multi-matrix approach, in an attempt to identify and examine the likely drivers behind the occurrence and distribution of these contaminants and their relationship to land-use gradients at both site and watershed scales, and their proximity to point sources (e.g., WWTPs and STPs). 
Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) were detected at all Great Lakes mussel study sites and their concentrations varied significantly among sampling locations, site land-use categories, and sites sampled upstream, sites in proximate location to point sources and sites downstream and along gradients of wastewater discharges. Elevated PPCP concentrations were detected in mussels sampled at designated low-developed sites, followed by urban and open-water sites, with concentrations detected 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher at some low-developed, urban and open-water sites. Proximity to point source discharges played an integral role in controlling PPCP composition and concentration (magnitude), with elevated concentration detected in agricultural influenced watershed riverine systems impacted by complex wastewater and combined sewer overflow (CSO) systems. Equally important, both legacy and current-use pesticides (CUPs) were ubiquitously detected as complex mixtures in mussels, clams and POCIS devices, at all sampled nested sites in the lower Maumee and Ottawa riverine systems. Residual pesticide frequency, magnitude and composition varied significantly by matrix type, compound group, site types and site and sub-watershed land-use categories.
The results from this study indicate that PPCPs and residual pesticides detected at sampling locations within Great Lakes Basin coastal zone watersheds and associated riverine systems are occurring as complex mixtures and their effects on non-targeted organisms and biota is unknown. The results presented will serve as an initial assessment to characterize various suites of legacy and emerging contaminants that had the highest probability of being detected in tissue as well as POCIS devices, and identify what methods could be used in the future to support the validity of ongoing contaminant assessment and classification at select Great Lakes MWP sites.},

	abstract = {Nanoparticles (NPs) have broad applications in medicine, cosmetics, optics, catalysis, environmental purification, and other areas nowadays. With increasing annual production of NPs, the risks of their harmful influence on the environment and human health are also increasing. Currently, our knowledge about the mechanisms of the interaction between NPs and living organisms is limited. The marine species and their habitat environment are under continuous stress owing to the anthropogenic activities, which result in the release of NPs in the aquatic environment. We used a bioassay model with hemocytes of three bivalve mollusc species, namely, Crenomytilus grayanus, Modiolus modiolus, and Arca boucardi, to evaluate the toxicity of 10 different types of NPs. Specifically, we compared the cytotoxic effects and cell-membrane polarization changes in the hemocytes exposed to carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, silicon nanotubes, cadmium and zinc sulfides, Au-NPs, and TiO2 NPs. Viability and the changes in hemocyte membrane polarization were measured by the flow cytometry method. The highest aquatic toxicity was registered for metal-based NPs, which caused cytotoxicity to the hemocytes of all the studied bivalve species. Our results also highlighted different sensitivities of the used tested mollusc species to specific NPs.},

	abstract = {Toxic cyanobacterial blooms are a major contaminant in inland aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, toxic blooms are carried downstream by rivers and waterways to estuarine and coastal ecosystems. Concerning marine and estuarine animal species, very little is known about how these species are affected by the exposure to freshwater cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. So far, most of the knowledge has been gathered from freshwater bivalve molluscs. This work aimed to infer the sensitivity of the marine mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis to single as well as mixed toxic cyanobacterial cultures and the underlying molecular responses mediated by toxic cyanobacteria. For this purpose, a mussel exposure experiment was outlined with two toxic cyanobacteria species, Microcystis aeruginosa and Chrysosporum ovalisporum at 1 × 105 cells/mL, resembling a natural cyanobacteria bloom. The estimated amount of toxins produced by M. aeruginosa and C. ovalisporum were respectively 0.023 pg/cell of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and 7.854 pg/cell of cylindrospermopsin (CYN). After 15 days of exposure to single and mixed cyanobacteria, a depuration phase followed, during which mussels were fed only non-toxic microalga Parachlorella kessleri. The results showed that the marine mussel is able to filter toxic cyanobacteria at a rate equal or higher than the non-toxic microalga P. kessleri. Filtration rates observed after 15 days of feeding toxic microalgae were 1773.04 mL/ind.h (for M. aeruginosa), 2151.83 mL/ind.h (for C. ovalisporum), 1673.29 mL/ind.h (for the mixture of the 2 cyanobacteria) and 2539.25 mL/ind.h (for the non-toxic P. kessleri). Filtering toxic microalgae in combination resulted in the accumulation of 14.17 ng/g dw MC-LR and 92.08 ng/g dw CYN. Other physiological and biochemical endpoints (dry weight, byssus production, total protein and glycogen) measured in this work did not change significantly in the groups exposed to toxic cyanobacteria with regard to control group, suggesting that mussels were not affected with the toxic microalgae. Nevertheless, proteomics revealed changes in metabolism of mussels related to diet, specially evident in those fed on combined cyanobacteria. Changes in metabolic pathways related with protein folding and stabilization, cytoskeleton structure, and gene transcription/translation were observed after exposure and feeding toxic cyanobacteria. These changes occur in vital metabolic processes and may contribute to protect mussels from toxic effects of the toxins MC-LR and CYN.},

	abstract = {Recent changes in climate and eutrophication have caused increases in oxygen depletion in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. However, the impact of oxygen stress on zooplankton, which is the major trophic link between primary producers and fish, remains largely unknown in lakes. Therefore, we studied 41 lakes with different trophic and oxygen conditions to assess the role of oxygen stress on zooplankton communities and carbon transfer between phytoplankton and zooplankton. Samples were collected from each lake at the peak of summer stratification from three depth layers (the epilimnion, metalimnion, and hypolimnion). Our results revealed that freshwater zooplankton were relatively tolerant to anoxic conditions and the greatest changes in community structure were found in lakes with the highest oxygen deficits. This caused a switch in dominance from large to small species and reduced the zooplankton biomass in lower, anoxic layers of water, but not in the upper layers of water where the oxygen deficits began. This upper anoxic layer could thus be a very important refuge for zooplankton to avoid predation during the day. However, the reduction of zooplankton in the lower water layers was the main factor that reduced the effectiveness of carbon transfer between the phytoplankton and zooplankton.},

Through high-filtering rates coupled with dense colonization, Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) are able to drastically alter the quantity of particulate matter through translocation into the sediment, potentially including sources of eDNA in lotic and lentic systems. Using a longitudinal, laboratory experiment, we tested the effect of varying densities of Asian clams on the translocation rate of common goldfish (Carassius auratus) DNA. Target DNA in testing tanks was quantified through quantitative PCR (qPCR) at regular intervals and compared. Tanks housing the highest density of Asian clams produced significantly lower DNA concentrations over time compared to tanks of lower densities. These results show, for the first time, a density-dependent reduction of local eDNA sources by bivalve filtration that may lead to the obstructed detection of target species through the sampling of eDNA. Based on these findings, we recommend highly concentrated bivalve populations be taken into consideration when choosing the time and locality of eDNA sampling efforts.},

	abstract = {The shell is the most conspicuous and variable part of a bivalve and is largely affected by environmental conditions. Thus, this study was conducted to describe the changes in the shell shape of the horse mussel Modiolus metcalfei from Dumangas, Iloilo. Allometric changes in shape, sex-induced shape differences, and asymmetry were investigated using geometric morphometric methods. A total of 12 landmarks where used to obtain biological shape information from 60 horse mussel individuals. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed significant differences of shell shapes between sexes (Wilk's lamda=0.01, p=1.26E-219). Generally, males have an expanded shell but compressed mid-shell region while females have compressed shell but expanded mid- and postero-ventral region. Moreover, the multivariate regression of shape on centroid size was statistically significant (p less than 0.001, Goodall's F-test). Smaller individuals were slender and elongate while larger individuals were slightly rounded and curved.Furthermore, directional and fluctuating asymmetry were highly significant (p less than 0.0001, Procrustes ANOVA), indicating developmental instability probably caused by the ecological health of the coastal waters of Dumangas, Iloilo. The differences in shape between sexes were attributed to the differences in reproductive roles while allometric shell morphology changes reflected its adaptation to the environment.},

	abstract = {Environmental temperatures and oxygen availability are important for the balance between oxygen supply and demand. Terrestrial organisms are generally perceived to be less limited by access to oxygen than their aquatic counterparts. Nevertheless, even terrestrial environments can be deficient in oxygen, especially for organisms occurring in soil, litter, wood, rotten fruit or at high elevations. While isopods are the best adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle among crustaceans, many species, including woodlice, occupy environmental gradients of temperature and oxygen. To investigate whether mismatches between oxygen supply and demand can result in a loss of performance in a terrestrial organism, we studied the effects of atmospheric oxygen concentration on the thermal performance of the common rough woodlouse (Porcellio scaber). We compared the thermal preference, thermal sensitivity of running speed, and tolerance to extreme temperatures of woodlice exposed to one of two oxygen concentrations (21\% - normoxia, 7\% - hypoxia). Under hypoxia, P. scaber preferred microhabitats with temperatures that were on average 3°C lower than those preferred under normoxia. The running speed tended to reach its maximum at a lower temperature under hypoxia than under normoxia (25.13°C vs 28.87°C, respectively, although p was equal to 0.09), and normoxic woodlice ran approximately 1.5-fold faster than hypoxic woodlice at the point of maximum speed. Heat tolerance was significantly lower under hypoxia (38.9°C) than under normoxia (40.7°C), but there was no difference in cold tolerance (5.81°C under normoxia and 5.44°C under hypoxia). Overall, our results indicate that environmental gradients of temperature and oxygen may shape the physiological performance of terrestrial ectotherms, likely via their effects on the balance between oxygen supply and demand, which may have fitness consequences for these organisms in nature.},

	abstract = {Multiple introductions of alien species can lead to the formation of new and diverse communities with diverse interactions, particularly in isolated freshwater ecosystems. In Lake Arréo (currently known as Caicedo-Yuso), located in Basque Country, Northern Spain, the introduction of several North American species (largemouth bass Micropterus salmoides, pumpkinseed Lepomis gibbosus and the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii) and the common carp Cyprinus carpio has resulted in a unique community composed mainly of alien species. Previous efforts to eradicate them by intensive fishing/trapping have failed. Reintroduction of native predators could represent a complementary method, with an added biodiversity value. The reintroduction of the European eel Anguilla anguilla could lead to an increased predation on crayfish as shown by previous studies, but also affects the abundance of juvenile fish. To investigate the current situation of Lake Arreo, stable isotope analyses were conducted using 15 muscle tissue samples per each fish and crayfish species, while stomach contents of the same species were analysed. Additionally, samples from the common reed Phragmites australis, the trophically lowest food source available for fish and crayfish species, were collected and used as baseline for the isotope analysis. To investigate the usefulness of stable isotopes to predict the effects of species reintroductions on present species communities, available stable isotope and diet data from A. anguilla in a German freshwater lake with a similar species composition were retrieved and included in the Arreo community analysis. While results from both, dietary and stable isotope analyses, indicate high interactions among alien species with P. clarkii having a central position, the modelled reintroduction of A. anguilla shows to possibly affect recruits of alien fish species as well as an increased feeding of M. salmoides on reintroduced eels.},

	abstract = {High riverine nutrient loads caused poor water quality, low water transparency and an unsatisfactory ecological status in the Szczecin (Oder) Lagoon, a trans-boundary water at the southern shore of the Baltic Sea. Total annual riverine N (P) loads into the lagoon raised at the 20th century from approx. 14,000{\textasciitilde}t{\textasciitilde}TN (1,000{\textasciitilde}t{\textasciitilde}TP) to 115,000{\textasciitilde}t{\textasciitilde}TN (10,500{\textasciitilde}t{\textasciitilde}TP) in the 1980ties and declined to about 56,750{\textasciitilde}t{\textasciitilde}TN (2,800{\textasciitilde}t{\textasciitilde}TP) after 2010. Nutrient concentrations, water transparency (Secchi depth) and chlorophyll-a showed a positive response to the reduced nutrient loads in the Polish eastern lagoon. This was not the case in the German western lagoon, where summer Secchi depth is 0.6 m and mean chlorophyll-a concentration is four times above the threshold for the Good Ecological Status. Measures to improve the water quality focused until now purely on nutrient load reductions, but the nutrient load targets and Maximal Allowable Inputs are contradicting between EU Water Framework Directive and EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. According to the HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan, the thresholds of the annual riverine nutrient inputs to the lagoon would be about 48,850{\textasciitilde}t{\textasciitilde}N (1,570{\textasciitilde}t{\textasciitilde}P). Actions in the river basins that would allow meeting these targets are hardly achievable. Even if the load targets would be fully implemented, they are not sufficient to transfer the lagoon into a non-eutrophic state. The implementation of EU Water Framework Directive is further hampered, as consistent water quality thresholds for the two parts of Szczecin Lagoon are missing. An approach to harmonize them is presented, which incorporates the spatial differences. By implementing consistent water quality targets, Szczecin Lagoon could serve as blueprint for other trans-boundary waters. In the western lagoon, nutrient load reductions in the past decades had no effect on the water quality. High water residence times, frequent sediment resuspension and the missing submerged vegetation inhibit the load reduction effects on the water quality. Internal measures in the western lagoon are necessary, which aim at removing nutrients and\${\textbackslash}/\$ or increasing water transparency to overcome the hysteresis effect and to initiate a recovery of macrophytes. The most promising approach seems the cultivation of zebra mussels.},

The holistic approach needs to contain not just the development of economy and society but also take into account the negative impacts of this growth on the environment, from that, the balance between the three dimensions can be sustained to reach a sustainable future. As such, this paper provides a comprehensive review on future opportunities and challenges for the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs via a critical analysis on their contribution to individual and subsets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Currently, lakes and reservoirs are key freshwater resources. They play crucial roles in human societies for drinking water provision, food production (via fisheries, aquaculture, and the irrigation of agricultural lands), recreation, energy provision (via hydropower dams), wastewater treatment, and flood and drought control. Because of the (mostly) recent intensive exploitations, many lakes and reservoirs are severely deteriorated. In recent years, physical (habitat) degradation has become very important while eutrophication remains the main issue for many lakes and ponds worldwide. Besides constant threats from anthropogenic activities, such as urbanization, industry, aquaculture, and watercourse alterations, climate change and emerging contaminants, such as microplastics and antimicrobial resistance, can generate a global problem for the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs. In relation to the SDGs, the actions for achieving the sustainability of lakes and reservoirs have positive links with the SDGs related to environmental dimensions (Goals 6, 13, 14, and 15) as they are mutually reinforcing each other. On the other hand, these actions have direct potential conflicts with the SDGs related to social and economic dimensions (Goals 1, 2, 3 and 8). From these interlinkages, we propose 22 indicators that can be used by decision makers for monitoring and assessing the sustainable development of lakes and reservoirs.},

	abstract = {The Neotropics represent a hotspot for freshwater biodiversity with vast number of fish species of scarce ecological knowledge. This holds true for the Uruguay River, where fish assemblages and their diets remain unexplored. Fish assemblages were surveyed in 14 sites along the river main course, from headwaters to mouth (approximately 1800 km), with the aim to identify the trophic roles of fishes and to describe trophic structure of these assemblages, following standardized sampling campaigns and laboratory procedures. One hundred species (2309 gut contents) were analysed and classified into four trophic groups subdivided into eight lower-level groups: Piscivore, piscivore-invertivore, detritivore, omnivore-detritivore, omnivore-invertivore, omnivore-planktivore and omnivore-herbivore. The trophic structure of the assemblages varied along the river, with the relative species richness of fish consuming terrestrial invertebrates increasing towards the middle river section, probably driven by the large floodplains in that areas, supporting global theories such as the flood pulse concept. This study describes the feeding habits of fish along the Uruguay River, being the first dietary description for 29 species. This knowledge is essential for management and conservation, serving as baseline in the context of future environmental changes while generating novel evidence on the functioning of ecosystems in this scarcely studied climatic region.},

[...]one weakness identified in MESAT is that by using the average it gives the same weight for all components, meaning that one service which is represented by only one indicator has the same weight as a service represented by five [23].

Besides the average, and aiming at improving the aggregation process of MESAT, this study developed two new indices, (1) the weighted index based on the number of categories of change from the previous hierarchical level and (2) the weighted index including the reliability score of each indicator used.

According to the case study characteristics, Szczecin Lagoon and Greifswald Bay, with lower salinities and higher water residence times, showed a decrease of provisioning ES compared to the Pomeranian Bay which has higher salinity and short water residence time.

Since for all water bodies reference conditions are defined by the member states, and this is a publicly accepted and accessible information, it is in principle possible to define an initial status in other European regions as well.},

	abstract = {Despite the increasing number of invasive species, protocols devoted to assess the feasibility (i.e., probability of success or failure) of management actions in the field are scarce, yet success depends on a broad scope of issues beyond the biology of species and the ecosystem to be managed. In this paper we make a retrospective analysis of 90 actions and management proposals developed in Andalusia (southern Spain) in 2004 to 2018. Actions included 59 terrestrial and aquatic taxa. We identified items that in case of deficiency were responsible for either the rejection of action proposals (n = 44) or failure of implemented actions for which the goal was not achieved (n = 22). The most frequent deficiencies included the absence of funding during the necessary time to achieve the goals, the risk of reinvasion and an insufficient removal rate to achieve the specific objective. Based on the deficiencies found, we built a comprehensive, broad-scope compliance checklist to assist decision-makers to identify deficiencies before action. In addition, implemented actions for which the goal was achieved (n = 24) were used for validating the checklist. The checklist contains 40 items related to IAS features, administrative features, methodology effectiveness, efficiency and impacts of the action, and invaded ecosystem features. The checklist is valid across all taxa and habitats. The use of this checklist will help reduce the degree of arbitrariness and subjectivity of actions aimed at managing IAS, and a more efficient use of resources.},

Using a rapid roadside survey technique, we aimed to (1) establish a baseline of alien plant distribution and abundance along roads in the Garden Route, South Africa, and (2) identify priority species (particularly sleeper weeds) and priority areas to inform appropriate management action. We surveyed along 530 km of roads and recorded 109 alien and/or extralimital species across 1942 point locations. Of these, 35 species were considered to be sleeper weeds on account of displaying estimated dispersal distances distinctive of invasive plants and not being listed by the  South African Plant Invaders Atlas  (SAPIA) or regulated by South African legislation. Roads along natural forest and fynbos vegetation (often within the Garden Route National Park) displayed lower incidences of alien plants than those associated with degraded or transformed land, with roads along farmland associated with the highest incidences of alien plants. Roads in the Southern Cape region had more species and higher densities of alien plants than roads in the Tsitsikamma region, and a few species were exclusive to either.
Conservation implications  : Our inventory contributed significant new records and range extensions to SAPIA, while the identified sleeper weeds offered suggestions for species that may be considered for regulation under the  National Environmental Management: Biodiversity Act  of South Africa. We furthermore provided information to facilitate (1) timely management of emerging invasive alien plants, (2) prioritisation of species and areas for management action, and (3) future monitoring of alien plants in the Garden Route National Park and surrounds.},

	abstract = {The slipper limpet Crepidula fornicata is an emblematic invasive species along the northeast Atlantic coast. This gregarious gastropod lives in stacks of several individuals and forms extended beds in shallow subtidal areas. The effects of this engineer species on the colonized habitat can be physical (e.g., presence of hard-shell substrates with uneven topography) or biological (e.g., nutrient enrichment by direct excretion or via biodeposition). We hypothesized that through biological activity, nutrient fluxes at the sediment-water interface are enhanced, leading to stimulated primary productivity by microphytobenthos (MPB) associated with Crepidula beds. To test this fertilization hypothesis, we conducted a 10-day mesocosm experiment using C. fornicata (live and dead) placed on top of sieved and homogenized sediment collected in situ. We used hyperspectral imaging to non-invasively map the development of MPB biomass, and to assess the potential influence of C. fornicata and its spatial extent. Our results showed that live C. fornicata significantly promote MPB growth through both physical and biological effects, with the biological effect dominating over the pure physical one. The highest stimulation was observed on the shells, suggesting that dissolved metabolic products excreted by C. fornicata were likely the main factor stimulating MPB growth in our short-term experiment. Our findings provide first direct evidence that stimulation of MPB growth by the biological activity of larger benthic epifauna occurs not only in intertidal but also in shallow subtidal habitats. More research is needed to assess the contribution of this fertilization effect to the trophic functioning of subtidal benthic systems.},

The detection and identification of these organisms in their adult phase in the rivers is not a problem; however, the identification of bivalve larvae by usual morphological methods is difficult due to high similarity conserved in these stages. The use of PCR-RFLP has proven to be an efficient and agile molecular method that allowed the detection of different patterns in the agarose gel for the two bivalves tested. The gel pattern showed a 100 bp band for L. fortunei not detected for C. fluminea. Thus, it is possible to detect larvae of these species from water samples, which can be a powerful tool for environmental monitoring programs on aquatic invasive species.},

He worked also on several aspects of biodiversity and conservation since 2003. He participated in the last years to five international expeditions, two in Malaysia, one in Vietnam, one in Ecuador and one in Kenya for the monitoring of entomo-fauna and the study of alien species. He is collaborating with national and international researchers on alien species, especially on insects and their impacts. Giuseppe is author of 58 peer-reviewed publications (31 with IF).Elena Tricarico (Edited By) - Elena studied and took her Master and PhD on Ethology and Animal Ecology at the University of Florence, working mostly on aquatic invertebrates. Since as a Master student, she deals with the biological invasions problem, particularly in freshwater ecosystems, through different perspectives, from behavioural ecology to management aspects. Elena participated to several national and European projects (as DAISIE, IMPASSE) on alien species, and she recently started to work on the predictive aspects of this problem, especially in relation to the climate change. Her main fields of research range from biological invasions to social behaviour in invertebrates, leading her to travel around Europe, USA and Africa, to establish many fruitful collaborations and to produce 60 peer reviewed publications (42 with IF), 5 book chapters and 1 edited book.Currently, she is involved in the COST Action TD1209 (Alien Challenge). Elena was co-responsible for the revision of the freshwater species of the EASIN catalogue and she is on its editorial board.},

Cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii) are one of the most widely distributed freshwater fish species in western North America exhibiting substantial phenotypic and genetic variability; however, fish stocking practices have translocated populations outside of their native range and may have obscured intraspecific boundaries. This study focuses on cutthroat trout populations representing three distinct evolutionary clades that are found intermixed within a contact zone between the Bonneville and upper Snake River watersheds in the western United States. We used mitochondrial and microsatellite genetic data, as well as historical stocking records, to evaluate whether populations of cutthroat trout in the contact zone are native or are introduced. We found significant genetic differentiation and fine-scale genetic population structure that was organized primarily by watershed boundaries. While we detected increased genetic diversity in some areas in close proximity to the greatest number of stocking events, the highly organized population structure both within and between areas of the contact zone indicates that the populations are native to the watersheds. Intermixing of distinct evolutionary lineages of cutthroat trout appears to be the result of historical connections between paleodrainages. Our analyses provide a context for understanding how genetic data can be used to assess the status of populations as native or introduced.},

For each treatment, adult Dv were submerged for 15 minutes at different concentrations to determine the maximum lethal concentration, and for each effective treatment for different times to assess a minimal lethal time (LT50).

Due to various drawbacks in the use of sodium hypochlorite, FAM30® and Virkon S® (e.g. health and safety, legal use) they were not recom¬mended as biosecurity treatments, whereas both water at high temperature and carbonated water showed promise.

The species composition of the fish fauna and the main limiting factors affecting the structure of the ichthyocenosis of the reservoir have been studied. It is noted that the fish fauna is dominated by invasive species (57\%), most of which are introduced for the biological melioration in a cooling pond. The decrease in the number of native fish species is caused both by the spread of invasive species and by the factor of high water temperature. The latter factor limits the number of fish species that do not tolerate a rise in water temperature (roach Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758), bream Abramis brama (Linnaeus, 1758), rudd Scardinius erythrophthalmus (Linnaeus, 1758)). The paper also presents the results of studies on the nutrition spectrum of fish living in the Zaporizhia NPP cooling pond. The dynamics of catches of the main ameliorative species over the last 10 years has been analyzed. Practical recommendations on the stocking the heat sink with ameliorative fish for the period of 2018-2022 are given.},

	abstract = {The assessment of ecosystem services, the benefits humans obtain from ecosystems, is a worldwide topic of growing interest, but examples addressing coastal and marine water are still a small minority. In this study, we carry out an expert based ecosystem service assessment for a concrete case study, the Szczecin (Oder) Lagoon located at the German/Polish border in the Baltic Sea region. We analyze to what extent, in which step and how it can be applied for supporting Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM), the ecological-social-economic assessment within System Approach Frameworks (SAF) and Marine Spatial Planning (MSP). The large, shallow Szczecin Lagoon is heavily eutrophied. Therefore, several alternative measures (scenarios) are under discussion to improve its water quality and its ecological status. Scenarios include a large-scale mussel farm; the establishment of a local mussel farm that removes nutrients via harvest and increases water transparency; artificial mussel beds; groynes to reduce coastal current velocities, favor sediment accumulation, and promote the enlargement of macrophyte beds and other measures to enlarge macrophyte belts and coverage. We adapt and apply a computer aided ecosystem service assessment and visualization tool (ESAT). Eight experts and two student groups apply this tool and carry out an assessment of each scenario compared to the present state of the lagoon. The results show that the scenario assuming measures to enlarge macrophyte belts is perceived as the one that generates the highest additional ecosystem service output. However, more importantly our approach can serve as tool to catch the views of experts, can extract disagreements between experts and misunderstandings in the setup of scenarios as well as services that have highest priority for further consideration. Further, the results are useful for preparing stakeholder discussions and workshops. However, the expert assessments are influenced by the spatial scale of the assessed scenarios. As consequence, the assessment results itself cannot be regarded as a reliable basis for decision making. Today, Integrated Coastal Zone Management ideas and approaches are well reflected and integrated into Marine Spatial Planning and we show that a comparative ecosystem service assessment can be applied in different steps of each concept.},

The complexity of Hg in the environment can hinder accurate determination of ecological and human health risks, particularly within the context of the rapid global changes that are altering many ecological processes, socioeconomic patterns, and other factors like infectious disease incidence, which can affect Hg exposures and health outcomes. However, the success of global Hg-reduction efforts depends on accurate assessments of their effectiveness in reducing health risks. In this paper, we examine the role that key extrinsic and intrinsic drivers play on several aspects of Hg risk to humans and organisms in the environment. We do so within three key domains of ecological and human health risk. First, we examine how extrinsic global change drivers influence pathways of Hg bioaccumulation and biomagnification through food webs. Next, we describe how extrinsic socioeconomic drivers at a global scale, and intrinsic individual-level drivers, influence human Hg exposure. Finally, we address how the adverse health effects of Hg in humans and wildlife are modulated by a range of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers within the context of rapid global change. Incorporating components of these three domains into research and monitoring will facilitate a more holistic understanding of how ecological and societal drivers interact to influence Hg health risks.},

	abstract = {Urban centers border western Lake Ontario, the terminus of the Laurentian Great Lakes, impacting water quality on the shores of this oligotrophic lake. The green algae Cladophora proliferates on the shallow lakebed and fouls the shoreline, presenting an eutrophication concern. The conditions over a typical urbanized shoreline were studied to assess linkages between Cladophora and area nutrient sources. The most pervasive of the mixing areas of varying extent identified using field sensor measurements was associated with the discharge of treated sewage from a Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP). Phosphorus and nitrogen were enriched at times near the WPCP diffuser and also in shallow water along the shoreline. Dissolved nutrients were also measured directly above the lakebed in close proximity to Cladophora. Dissolved phosphorus and inorganic nitrogen were higher in proximity to the WPCP diffuser at times, however, spatial patterns were not as clearly aligned with external inputs as the patterns of enrichment in the water column. Biomass distribution of Cladophora was unrelated to nutrient levels in the water column or at the lakebed. Yet, concentrations of phosphorus in Cladophora, an indicator of nutrient sufficiency, were higher near the WPCP diffuser. This disparity, while possibly an artifact of variable loss rates of biomass among locations, may in part stem from variable water clarity among areas. Abundant dreissenid mussels also potentially obscure the effects of nutrient loading on algal biomass if the sequestering of phosphorus from offshore plankton, suggested by periods of onshore circulation, approaches the extent of external loading. Further study of phosphorus flux at the lakebed is required to establish clear linkages between external nutrient loading and algal growth in order to manage the proliferation of Cladophora over urban coastline.},

	abstract = {Species conservation is typically founded upon a range of management strategies, which integrate both biological and socioeconomic data. In this thesis, population genetics, acoustic telemetry, spawning aggregation surveys and stakeholder assessments were used to address key knowledge gaps limiting effective conservation management for critically endangered Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) stocks in The Bahamas. A panel of polymorphic microsatellite markers was optimised to assess the genetic population dynamics of more than 400 Nassau grouper sampled throughout the country. Microsatellite data indicate that contemporary Nassau grouper populations in The Bahamas are predominantly genetically diverse and weakly differentiated, but lack geographic population structure. Assessments of changes in effective population size (Ne) show substantive reductions in Ne within The Bahamas compared to historic values that are likely due to natural disturbances. Evidence for recent bottlenecks occurring in three islands as well as an active spawning site, along with higher inbreeding coefficients in two islands were also found, and can be attributed to more recent anthropogenic activities. Collapse of a historically important Nassau grouper fish spawning aggregation (FSA) was supported by both acoustic telemetry and spawning aggregation survey dives. Restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) of 94 Nassau grouper was used to explore intraspecific population dynamics, loci under selection and patterns of gene flow in The Bahamas. Genomic assessments of diversity were in accord with microsatellite data and examinations of gene flow support higher levels of connectivity in The Bahamas than was previously suggested. The increased resolution gained from assessments of genomic data support intraspecific population structuring that may be driven by differences in gene flow and putative loci under divergent selection. Telemetry data were successfully used to identify the origins of spawning adults, and support demographic connectivity through migrations between an active FSA in the central Bahamas and home reef habitats within the Exumas and a no-take marine protected area. Stakeholder assessments highlight the complexities of fisheries management within The Bahamas, with key stakeholders often exhibiting conflicting opinions regarding the status of Nassau grouper and the efficacy of  management options. However, these groups mutually agree upon the need to better manage remaining Nassau grouper stocks within The Bahamas through science-grounded policies. Synthesis of these studies along with a review of fisheries governance in The Bahamas was used to develop a comprehensive national management plan for Nassau grouper to facilitate better conservation for remaining populations of this ecologically important marine species.},

	abstract = {Land use and cover change (LUCC) is the main cause of natural ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss and can cause a decrease in ecosystem service provision. Animal populations are providers of some key regulation services: pollination, pest and disease control and seed dispersal, the so-called faunal ecosystem services (FES). Here we aim to give an overview on the current and future status of regulation FES in response to change from original habitat to agricultural land globally. FES are much more tightly linked to wildlife populations and biodiversity than are most ecosystem services, whose determinants are largely climatic and related to vegetation structure. Degradation of ecosystems by land use change thus has much more potential to affect FES. In this scoping review, we summarise the main findings showing the importance of animal populations as FES providers and as a source of ecosystem disservices; underlying causes of agriculturalisation impacts on FES and the potential condition of FES under future LUCC in relation to the expected demand for FES globally. Overall, studies support a positive relationship between FES provision and animal species richness and abundance. Agriculturalisation has negative effects on FES providers due to landscape homogenisation, habitat fragmentation and loss, microclimatic changes and development of population imbalance, causing species and population losses of key fauna, reducing services whilst enhancing disservices. Since evidence suggests an increase in FES demand worldwide is required to support increased farming, it is imperative to improve the understanding of agriculturalisation on FES supply and distribution. Spatial conservation prioritisation must factor in faunal ecosystem functions as the most biodiversity-relevant of all ecosystem services and that which most closely links sites of service provision of conservation value with nearby sites of service use to provide ecosystem services of agricultural and economic value.},

	abstract = {Increasing variation in ocean temperature may affect the metabolism and energetic demands of many species. Understanding such effects is particularly important for sedentary species that cannot make large-scale movements in response to changes in environmental conditions. I examined how metabolic rates responded to temperature in the bluebanded goby (Lythrypnus dalli) and the Woolly Sculpin (Clinocottus analis). Oxygen consumption and metabolic rate increased significantly with temperature for both species, but L. dalli was much more sensitive to the effects of temperature than C. analis (Q 10 values were 5.21 and 3.02, respectively). Thermal fluctuations likely play a significant role in the ecology of these species and continued increases in seawater temperature will either necessitate an increase in foraging and food consumption or drive costly trade-offs between metabolism and processes such as growth and reproduction.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12862-018-1219-9},
	abstract = {Background 
Anthropogenic factors can have a major impact on the contemporary distribution of intraspecific genetic diversity. Many freshwater fishes have finely structured and locally adapted populations, but their natural genetic structure can be affected by river engineering schemes across river basins, fish transfers in aquaculture industry and conservation management. The European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus) is a small fish that is a brood parasite of freshwater mussels and is widespread across continental Europe. Its range recently expanded, following sharp declines in the 1970s and 1980s. We investigated its genetic variability and spatial structure at the centre of its distribution at the boundary of three watersheds, testing the role of natural and anthropogenic factors in its genetic structure.
Results
Sequences of mitochondrial cytochrome B (CYTB) revealed that bitterling colonised central Europe from two Ponto-Caspian refugia, which partly defines its contemporary genetic structure. Twelve polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed pronounced interpopulation differentiation, with significant small-scale differentiation within the same river basins. At a large scale, populations from the Baltic Sea watershed (middle Oder and Vistula basins) were distinct from those from the Black Sea watershed (Danube basin), while populations from rivers of the North Sea watershed (Rhine, Elbe) originated from the admixture of both original sources. Notable exceptions demonstrated the potential role of human translocations across watersheds, with the upper River Oder (Baltic watershed) inhabited by fish from the Danube basin (Black Sea watershed) and a population in the southern part of the River Elbe (North Sea watershed) basin possessing a signal of admixture from the Danube basin.
Conclusions
Hydrography and physical barriers to dispersal are only partly reflected in the genetic structure of the European bitterling at the intersection of three major watersheds in central Europe. Drainage boundaries have been obscured by human-mediated translocations, likely related to common carp, Cyprinus carpio, cultivation and game-fish management. Despite these translocations, populations of bitterling are significantly structured by genetic drift, possibly reinforced by its low dispersal ability. Overall, the impact of anthropogenic factors on the genetic structure of the bitterling populations in central Europe is limited.},

We incubated eggs of M. reevesii and T. scripta elegans from different cohorts at 29 °C, and measured the critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax) of hatchlings. Our results preliminarily showed that the hatchlings of T. scripta elegans had a greater high-temperature tolerance and wider tolerance range than the hatchlings of M. reevesii; in the two-cohort system, individuals from the high-latitude cohort seemed to have greater low-temperature tolerance but similar high-temperature tolerance compared with those from the low-latitude cohort. Relatively greater thermal tolerance ability for T scripta elegans might reflect its environmental adaptability to thermal stress.},

	abstract = {To date, numerous studies of the impact of snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843) on invaded ecosystems have been conducted. However, the majority of such studies intended to assess changes induced in macroinvertebrate assemblages, while the possible effects of P. antipodarum on higher trophic levels have not hitherto been studied. Of particular interest from the point of view of fisheries management is the elucidation of how this invasive snail can alter the energy flow towards higher trophic levels. When abundant, P. antipodarum consumes a substantial part of the primary production, but it is poorly consumed by native fishes. Consequently, part of its assimilated energy may become locked in lower trophic levels and fail to reach higher levels directly. Therefore, invasion of this snail may decrease fish production. Several years after establishment of P. antipodarum in a temperate mesotrophic Lake Dusia, we assessed: (1) changes in the biomass of littoral macroinvertebrates (proxy to secondary production), (2) assimilation of P. antipodarum by benthivorous fish (energy flow), and (3) changes in growth and catches of littoral benthivorous fish (fish production). All the analyses were based on a merger of "grey" literature and original data during the pre- and post-invasion periods. There was an evident increase in the biomass of littoral macroinvertebrates, and the assemblage changed from crustacean- to gastropod-dominated due to over-domination of P. antipodarum. However, P. antipodarum did not replace the native prey of fish. Moreover, a marked decrease was recorded in littoral fish growth and catches after the invasion of P. antipodarum. Dense populations of P. antipodarum may reduce the channelling of primary production towards higher trophic levels and, consequently, the invasion may threaten fisheries of temperate mesotrophic lakes.},

	abstract = {Empirical studies of graphs have contributed enormously to our understanding of complex systems, growing into a more scientific exploration of communities spanning the physical, biological, and social called network science. As the quantity and types of networks have grown so has their heterogeneity in quality and specificity resulting in a wealth of datasets that are not matched by existing theoretical methods. This is especially true in ecology where the majority of interactions are indirect and unobservable even in well-studied systems. As a result ecologists continue to grapple with three fundamental questions: Most basically, (i) `How do ecosystems function?' I answered this question by comparing networks to each other such that poorly-studied systems can be understood through their similarity to well-understood ones and theoretical models. To do this I created the alignment algorithm netcom which recasts ecosystem processes as statistical dynamics of diffusion kernels originating from a network's constituent nodes. Using netcom I constructed a supervised classifier which can distinguish processes in both synthetic and empirical network data. While this kind of inference works on currently available network data, I have shown how causality can serve as a more effective and unifying currency of ecological interaction. Measures of causality are even able to identify complex interactions across organizational scales of communities, answering the longstanding question (ii) `Can community structure causally determine dynamics of constituent species?' Moreover, causal inference can be readily combined with existing modeling frameworks to quantify dynamic interactions at the same scale as the underlying data. In this way we can answer the question (iii) `Which species in an ecosystem cause which other species?' These tools are part of a paradigm shift in ecology that offers the potential to make more reliable management decisions for dynamic ecosystems in real time using only observational data.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of estimation of fisheries Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) reference points using an ecosystem model built for Mille Lacs Lake, the second largest lake within Minnesota, USA. Data from single-species modelling output, extensive annual sampling for species abundances, annual catch-survey, stomach-content analysis for predatory-prey interactions, and expert opinions were brought together within the framework of an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) ecosystem model. An increase in the lake water temperature was observed in the last few decades; therefore, we also incorporated a temperature forcing function in the EwE model to capture the influences of changing temperature on the species composition and food web. The EwE model was fitted to abundance and catch time-series for the period 1985 to 2006. Using the ecosystem model, we estimated reference points for most of the fished species in the lake at single-species as well as ecosystem levels with and without considering the influence of temperature change; therefore, our analysis investigated the trophic and temperature effects on the reference points. The paper concludes that reference points such as MSY are not stationary, but change when (1) environmental conditions alter species productivity and (2) fishing on predators alters the compensatory response of their prey. Thus, it is necessary for the management to re-estimate or re-evaluate the reference points when changes in environmental conditions and/or major shifts in species abundance or community structure are observed.},

Present and future international biosecurity directives can be accomplished only if the biota acquired by maritime traffic in ports is controlled. Methodologies for biota inventory are diverse and now rely principally on extensive and labor-intensive sampling along with taxonomic identification by experts. In this study, we employed an extremely simplified environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling methodology from only three 1-L bottles of water per port, followed by metabarcoding (high-throughput sequencing and DNA-based species identification) using 18S rDNA and Cytochrome oxidase I as genetic barcodes. Eight Bay of Biscay ports with available inventory of fouling invertebrates were employed as a case study. Despite minimal sampling efforts, three invasive invertebrates were detected: the barnacle Austrominius modestus, the tubeworm Ficopomatus enigmaticus and the polychaete Polydora triglanda. The same species have been previously found from visual and DNA barcoding (genetic identification of individuals) surveys in the same ports. The current costs of visual surveys, conventional DNA barcoding and this simplified metabarcoding protocol were compared. The results encourage the use of metabarcoding for early biosecurity alerts.},

	abstract = {Some species of birds react to climate change by reducing the distance they travel during migration. The Odra River Estuary in the Baltic Sea is important for wintering waterfowl and is where we investigated how waterbirds respond to freezing surface waters. The most abundant birds here comprise two ecological groups: bottom-feeders and piscivores. Numbers of all bottom-feeders, but not piscivores, were negatively correlated with the presence of ice. With ongoing global warming, this area is increasing in importance for bottom-feeders and decreasing for piscivores. The maximum range of ice cover in the Baltic Sea has a weak and negative effect on both groups of birds. Five of the seven target species are bottom-feeders (Greater Scaup Aythya marila, Tufted Duck A. fuligula, Common Pochard A. ferina, Common Goldeneye Bucephala clangula and Eurasian Coot Fulica atra), and two are piscivores (Smew Mergellus albellus and Goosander Mergus merganser). Local changes at the level of particular species vary for different reasons. A local decline of the Common Pochard may simply be a consequence of its global decline. Climate change is responsible for some of the local changes in the study area, disproportionately favoring some duck species while being detrimental to others.},

	abstract = {One major goal for phylogeographical studies is to elucidate respective roles of multiple evolutionary and ecological forces that shape the current distribution patterns. In marine and coastal ecosystems, it has been generated a common realization that species with enormous population size and pelagic larval stages can disperse across broad geographical scales, leading to weak or even no phylogeographical structure across large geographical scales. However, the violation of such realization has been frequently reported, and it remains largely unexplored on mechanisms responsible for various phylogeographical patterns observed in different species at varied geographical scales. Here, we used a species-rich genus Nassarius to assess and compare phylogeographical patterns in congeneric species, and discuss causes and consequences underlying varied phylogeographical patterns. Interestingly, we observed complex phylogeographical patterns both within single species and across multiple species, and multiple analyses showed varied levels of genetic heterogeneity among sites within and across species. Available evidence suggests that related species with similar biological characteristics may not be necessary to result in consistent phylogeographical patterns. Multiple factors, including larval ecology, interactions between dispersal and natural selection, and human activity-mediated dispersal, can partially explain the complex patterns observed in this study. Deep investigations should be performed on these factors, particularly their respective roles in determining evolutionary/ecological processes to form phylogeographical patterns in species with high dispersal capacities in marine and coastal ecosystems.},

DNA based techniques are advancing, but our understanding of the limits to detection for metabarcoding complex samples is inadequate. For detecting AIS at an early stage of invasion when the species is rare, accuracy at low detection limits is key. To evaluate the utility of metabarcoding in future fish community monitoring programs, we conducted several experiments to determine the sensitivity and accuracy of routine metabarcoding methods. Experimental mixes used larval fish tissue from multiple "common" species spiked with varying proportions of tissue from an additional "rare" species. Pyrosequencing of genetic marker, COI (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) and subsequent sequence data analysis provided experimental evidence of low-level detection of the target "rare" species at biomass percentages as low as 0.02\% of total sample biomass. Limits to detection varied interspecifically and were susceptible to amplification bias. Moreover, results showed some data processing methods can skew sequence-based biodiversity measurements from corresponding relative biomass abundances and increase false absences. We suggest caution in interpreting presence/absence and relative abundance in larval fish assemblages until metabarcoding methods are optimized for accuracy and precision.},

	abstract = {Aim: We investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of abundance and diversity of planktonic ciliate community, in the last undammed stretch of the Upper Paraná River, Brazil. Methods: In order to reach this result, seven field campaigns were performed over two years. Plankton samples were collected from 10 transects through this stretch of the river (230 Km), near the banks and on the center, as well on seven of its tributaries. Results: 118 ciliate species were identified, among which the peritrichs were the most abundant while the order Hymenostomatida was the most specious group. We recorded a remarkable increase in abundance and species richness along the river, especially in the rainy period. Moreover, in this period we found an increase in the beta-diversity along the river, which consists in a remarkable distinction among the low, middle and high stretch ofthe river. In this way, continuous changes in the community structure of planktonic ciliates were evidenced, highlighting the importance of the precipitation and tributaries in the maintenance of the highest regional diversity in the studied area. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest the requirement for conservation actions with the purpose to maintain those tributaries undammed, in order to avoid biotic homogenization processes and the consequent reduction of aquatic biodiversity in this important neotropical ecosystem.Alternate abstract:Objetivo: Investigaram-se no presente estudo os padröes espaciáis e temporais da abundancia e diversidade de espécies da comunidade de ciliados planctónicos, no último trecho livre de barramentos da planicie de inundaçâo do alto rio Paraná, Brasil. Métodos: Sete amostragens foram realizadas no periodo de dois anos. Amostras de ciliados foram coletadas ao longo de 10 transectos deste rio (230 Km), nas margens e no centro, bem como em sete de seus tributários. Resultados: Cento e dezoito espécies foram identificadas, dentre as quais, a ordem Peritrichia foi a mais abundante e Hymenostomatida a mais especiosa. Foi evidenciado um aumento na abundancia e riqueza de espécies ao longo do rio, especialmente no periodo chuvoso. Além disso, neste periodo foi registrado um incremento da diversidade beta ao longo do rio, consistindo em uma grande diferença entre os trechos a montante, intermediário e jusante da área de estudo. Assim, a gradativa alteraçâo na estrutura da comunidade de ciliados evidenciou uma grande influencia das chuvas e dos tributários na manutençâo da alta diversidade regional no trecho estudado. Conclusao: Os resultados evidenciam a necessidade de açöes de conservaçâo com o intuito de preservar os tributários livres de barramentos, a fim de evitar processos de homogeneizaçâo biótica e a consequente reduçâo da biodiversidade aquática neste importante ecossistema neotropical.},

Seasonally, they dominate many eutrophic lakes impacted by excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) forming dense accumulations of biomass known as cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms or cyanoHABs. Their dominance in eutrophic lakes is attributed to a variety of unique adaptations including N and P concentrating mechanisms, N2 fixation, colony formation that inhibits predation, vertical movement via gas vesicles, and the production of toxic or otherwise bioactive molecules. While some of these molecules have been explored for their medicinal benefits, others are potent toxins harmful to humans, animals, and other wildlife known as cyanotoxins. In humans these cyanotoxins affect various tissues, including the liver, central and peripheral nervous system, kidneys, and reproductive organs among others. They induce acute effects at low doses in the parts-per-billion range and some are tumor promoters linked to chronic diseases such as liver and colorectal cancer. The occurrence of cyanoHABs and cyanotoxins in lakes presents challenges for maintaining safe recreational aquatic environments and the production of potable drinking water. CyanoHABs are a growing problem in the North American (Laurentian) Great Lakes basin. This review summarizes information on the occurrence of cyanoHABs in the Great Lakes, toxicological effects of cyanotoxins, and appropriate numerical limits on cyanotoxins in finished drinking water.},

	abstract = {Dredging generates remobilisation of sediments contaminated by non-degradable compounds such as metals, to which aquatic organisms can be exposed. This study aims at assessing the environmental impact of sediments remobilised in the Rhine River (France) during the dredging of Marckolsheim dam by pumping/dilution in 2013 on metal speciation and organisms' exposure. The monitoring coupling chemical and biological tools was performed 2 years before dredging operation on 2 sampling sites, upstream and downstream from the discharge of pumping/dilution, to acquire data on the natural variability of labile (DGT as passive samplers), dissolved and particulate concentrations of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn, Pb and Zn in Rhine during full hydrological cycles. In parallel, size-calibrated zebra mussels were transplanted at both sites to monitor continuously metal bioavailability from particulate and dissolved fractions. This long-term monitoring allowed the establishment of reference baselines of Rhine water and mussels' contamination levels and subsequently, the detection of averred environmental changes due to the dredging. Indeed, Co and Mn accumulations in mussels exposed to the discharge were consistent with increasing labile species in Rhine whereas ones of Cr and Pb were likely due to an enhanced particulate bioavailability. Whatever the exposure route, the mussels recovered their basal metal contents 2 weeks after the end of dredging, suggesting a transient impact of sediment remobilisation on bioaccumulation. This long-term monitoring highlights the interest of coupling chemical and biological time-integrated tools for a better assessment of environmental risks because metallic exchanges between organisms and their media are complex and metal-specific.
Une opération de dragage engendre la remobilisation de sédiments contaminés par des composés non dégradables tels que les métaux, auxquels les organismes aquatiques peuvent être exposés. Cette étude vise à évaluer l'impact environnemental de la remobilisation de sédiments chargés en métaux dans le Rhin lors du dragage du barrage de Marckolsheim par pompage/dilution en 2013 sur la spéciation et l'exposition des organismes aux métaux. La surveillance chimique et biologique a été effectuée 2 ans avant l'opération de dragage sur 2 sites d'échantillonnage, en amont et en aval de la zone de rejet, pour acquérir des données sur l'évolution naturelle des concentrations labiles, dissoute et particulaires en Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Mn, Pb et en Zn dans le Rhin pendant des cycles hydrologiques complets. En parallèle, des moules zébrées calibrées ont été transplantées sur les deux sites pour surveiller la biodisponibilité particulaire et dissoute des métaux. Cette surveillance à long terme a permis d'établir des niveaux de contamination de référence du Rhin et des moules, et ainsi de détecter des changements environnementaux dus au dragage. En effet, les accumulations de Co et de Mn dans les moules exposées au rejet concordaient avec l'augmentation de leurs formes labiles dans l'eau du Rhin alors que celles de Cr et Pb étaient probablement liées à une biodisponibilité particulaire favorisée par la remobilisation de sédiments. Quelle que soit la voie d'exposition, les moules ont récupéré leur teneur basale en métaux 2 semaines après la fin du dragage, suggérant un impact transitoire de la remobilisation des sédiments sur la bioaccumulation. Cette surveillance à long terme met aussi en évidence l'intérêt de coupler des outils chimiques et biologiques pour une meilleure évaluation des risques environnementaux car les échanges métalliques entre les organismes et leurs milieux sont complexes et dépendent du métal considéré.},

	abstract = {The primary goal for remediation of sediments contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is the reduction of bioaccumulation in the aquatic food web, particularly in fish that is the source of exposure to top level predators and humans. While empirical results are available in the literature on bioavailability reductions after amendment of PCB-contaminated sediment with a strong sorbent like activated carbon (AC) or biochar, there is a lack of quantitative understanding on how reductions in sediment porewater and food concentrations impact accumulation in fish. Although passive sampling can measure freely dissolved concentrations accurately, there is a major gap in the utilization of fate and biouptake models that can use such measurements. In addition, well-calibrated partitioning models based on accurate freely dissolved concentrations that can predict uptake by pelagic organisms are lacking. The primary objective of this research was to test the ability of frequently used bioaccumulation models to predict changes in fish uptake upon amendment of AC sediment and use passive sampling inputs and additional studies to refine the predictions made by these bioaccumulation models.    Results from laboratory exposure studies with pelagic and benthic feeding fish indicate that by incorporating changes in porewater and overlying freely dissolved PCB concentrations in kinetic bioaccumulation models and by taking into account changes in food concentration it is possible to predict effectiveness of sediment remediation in reducing PCB uptake in fish. Assimilation efficiency of PCBs in the sediment were independently measured in a separate study and incorporated into the model. The modified model led to reasonable estimations of PCB uptake in the benthic feeding fish and was capable of predicting the dominant exposure pathways in the benthic and pelagic feeding fish as a result of their different feeding behaviour. Additionally, passive sampling measurements were linked to PCB accumulation in algae and zooplankton and resulted in refined models. Lastly, several scenarios were simulated to show the potential of a linked fate and biouptake model to capture the effect of different inputs.    This research presents a robust modeling framework that is able to predict uptake in fish after in situ remediation that alters bioavailability of PCBs in sediments with implications for risk assessment and management.},

We used two datasets to assess the efficacy of a quadrat-based sampling protocol for: (1) detecting mussel species at risk; (2) characterizing species composition; (3) providing accurate estimates of abundance; and (4) detecting changes in density. The protocol is based on a systematic design (with random starts) that samples 20\% of monitoring sites with visual-tactile surface searches and excavation of 1 m2 quadrats. The first dataset included 40 sampling sites in five Ontario rivers, and the second dataset consisted of complete census sampling at two 375 m2 sites that represented contrasting mussel assemblages. Our results show that the protocol can be expected to detect the majority of species present at a site and provide accurate and precise estimates of total mussel density. Excavation was essential for detection of small individuals and to accurately estimate abundance. However, the protocol was of limited usefulness for reliable detection of most species at risk. Furthermore, imprecise density estimates precluded detection of all but the most extreme changes in density of most individual species. Meeting monitoring objectives will require either substantially greater sampling effort under the current protocol, or a fundamental revision of the sampling approach.},

A model with juvenile and adult classes is first studied. Here, standard theory of monotone operators for integro-difference equations can be applied and yields explicit formulas for the asymptotic spreading speeds of the juvenile and adult crabs. A second model including an infected class is considered by introducing a castrating parasite Sacculina carcini as a biological control agent. The dynamics are complicated and simulations reveal the occurrence of periodic solutions and stacked fronts. In this case, only conjectures can be made for the asymptotic spreading speeds because of the lack of mathematical theory for non-monotone operators. This paper also emphasizes the need for mathematical studies of non-monotone operators in heterogeneous environments and the existence of stacked front solutions in biological invasion models.},

	abstract = {Marine ecosystems all over the globe are facing multiple simultaneous stressors including rapid climatic change and increased resource exploitation, such as fishing, petroleum exploration and shipping. The EU-funded DEVOTES project (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) aims to better understand the relationships between pressures from human activities and climatic influences and their effects on marine ecosystems. To achieve these goals, it is necessary among others, to test and validate innovative monitoring tools to improve our understanding of ecosystem and biodiversity changes. This paper outlines the application of a high frequency non-invasive (HFNI) valvometer as a potential tool for long-term marine monitoring and assessments. The principle of the method is based on the regular gaping behaviour (closing and opening of the valves) of bivalve molluscs and the fact that physical or chemical stressors disrupt that gaping reference pattern. Bivalve gaping behaviour is monitored in the natural environment, remotely, continuously over a time period of years, requirements that must be fulfilled if bivalve behaviour is to be a useful biomonitoring tool. Here, we review the literature and highlight potential uses of the HFNI valvometry as a biosensor, to monitor and provide early-warning alerts of changes in water quality, such as global temperature increase, releases of contaminants and toxic algal blooms. Finally, potential relevant applications for monitoring and assessing environmental status of marine waters in the context of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive are identified. Relevant descriptors, Criteria and Indicators of Good Environmental Status that might be monitored using the HFNI valvometer are discussed for monitoring bathing beaches and harbours, petroleum installations and aquaculture sites.},

Quantifying the environmental factors that affect the persistence of avian influenza virus is important for influencing our ability to predict future outbreaks and target surveillance and control methods. We conducted a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis of the environmental factors that affect the decay of low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) in water. Abiotic factors affecting the persistence of LPAIV have been investigated for nearly 40 years, yet published data was produced by only 26 quantitative studies. These studies have been conducted by a small number of principal authors (n = 17) and have investigated a narrow range of environmental conditions, all of which were based in laboratories with limited reflection of natural conditions. The use of quantitative meta-analytic techniques provided the opportunity to assess persistence across a greater range of conditions than each individual study can achieve, through the estimation of mean effect-sizes and relationships among multiple variables. Temperature was the most influential variable, for both the strength and magnitude of the effect-size. Moderator variables explained a large proportion of the heterogeneity among effect-sizes. Salinity and pH were important factors, although future work is required to broaden the range of abiotic factors examined, as well as including further diurnal variation and greater environmental realism generally. We were unable to extract a quantitative effect-size estimate for approximately half (50.4\%) of the reported experimental outcomes and we strongly recommend a minimum set of quantitative reporting to be included in all studies, which will allow robust assimilation and analysis of future findings. In addition we suggest possible means of increasing the applicability of future studies to the natural environment, and evaluating the biological content of natural waterbodies.},

	abstract = {Insect Ecology: An Ecosystem Approach, Fourth Edition, follows a hierarchical organization that begins with relatively easy-to-understand chapters on adaptive responses of insect populations to various environmental changes, disturbances, and anthropogenic activities, how insects find food and habitat resources, and how insects allocate available energy and nutrients. Chapters build on fundamental information to show how insect populations respond to changing environmental conditions, including spatial and temporal distribution of food and habitat. The next section integrates populations of interacting species within communities and how these interactions determine structure of communities over time and space. Other works in insect ecology stop there, essentially limiting presentation of insect ecology to evolutionary responses of insects to their environment, including the activities of other species. The unique aspect of this book is its four chapters on ecosystem structure and function, and how herbivores, pollinators, seed predators, and detritivores drive ecosystem dynamics and contribute to ecosystem stability. Provides the most advanced synthesis of insect ecology, with updated material throughout and new chapters Presents the roles of insects in delivery of ecosystem services and applications to pest management and conservation Features full coverage of ecosystem structure and function balanced with essential background on evolutionary aspects Includes case studies highlighting practical and theoretical applications for topics covered in each chapter},

	abstract = {Fluorescence by naturally occurring dissolved organic matter (FDOM) is a sensitive indicator of ballast water source, with high FDOM in coastal ballast water decreasing typically dramatically when replaced by oceanic seawater during ballast water exchange. In this study, FDOM was measured in 92 ships arriving at Pacific ports on the US west coast and in New Zealand, and used to assess their compliance with ballast water regulations that required 95\% replacement of port water to minimize invasive species risks. Fluorescence in many ships that reported ballast water exchange was significantly higher than is usual for oceanic seawater, and in several cases, significantly higher than in other ships with similar provenance and ballast water management. Pre-exchange source port conditions represented the largest source of uncertainty in the analysis, because residual coastal FDOM when highly fluorescent can significantly influence the fluorescence signature of exchanged ballast water. A meta-analysis comparing the intensities of FDOM in un-exchanged ballast tanks with calculated pre-exchange intensities assuming that ships all correctly implemented and reported ballast water exchange revealed notable discrepancies. Thus, the incidence of high-FDOM port waters was seven times lower in reality than would be expected on the basis of these calculations. The results suggest that a significant rate of reporting errors occur due to a combination of factors that may include inadequate ballast water exchange and unintentional or deliberate misreporting of ballast water management.},

The aim of this research was to characterize both short-term and long-term benthic communities associated with artificial hard bottom provided by man-made structures in the Southern Baltic Sea. Species composition as well as the abundance and biomass were examined at various sites. An inactive World War II torpedo testing facility in the Gulf of Gdansk served as a site for sampling long-term communities while short-term communities were sampled using settlement panels and PVC cylinders. Panels were deployed at the torpedo testing facility for 127 days. PVC cylinders were deployed for 141-190 days in the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone. Twenty six macrofaunal taxa, including 12 crustaceans, were identified during the research. [Mytilus edulis] and [Amphibalanus improvisus] were the most abundant invertebrates at sampled surfaces. Six non-indigenous species were found. For the first time adult individuals of [Mytilopsis leucophaeata] were found in the Polish Marine Areas indicating that it is possible for this non-indigenous species to reproduce in this region.},

	abstract = {The ability of bivalve filter feeders to limit phytoplankton biomass in shallow waters is well-documented, but the role of bivalves in shaping phytoplankton communities is not. The coupled effect of bivalve grazing at the sediment-water interface and sinking of phytoplankton cells to that bottom filtration zone could influence the relative biomass of sinking (diatoms) and non-sinking phytoplankton. Simulations with a pseudo-2D numerical model showed that benthic filter feeding can interact with sinking to alter diatom:non-diatom ratios. Cases with the smallest proportion of diatom biomass were those with the fastest sinking speeds and strongest bivalve grazing rates. Hydrodynamics modulated the coupled sinking-grazing influence on phytoplankton communities. For example, in simulations with persistent stratification, the non-sinking forms accumulated in the surface layer away from bottom grazers while the sinking forms dropped out of the surface layer toward bottom grazers. Tidal-scale stratification also influenced vertical gradients of the two groups in opposite ways. The model was applied to Suisun Bay, a low-salinity habitat of the San Francisco Bay system that was transformed by the introduction of the exotic clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Simulation results for this Bay were similar to (but more muted than) those for generic habitats, indicating that P. amurensis grazing could have caused a disproportionate loss of diatoms after its introduction. Our model simulations suggest bivalve grazing affects both phytoplankton biomass and community composition in shallow waters. We view these results as hypotheses to be tested with experiments and more complex modeling approaches.},

	abstract = {Simple environmental features can shape complex behavior. Identifying key aspects of the environment (e.g., temperature, structure, toxins) that lead to widespread consequences is of central importance in a changing world. The primary objective of my dissertation is to investigate how relatively simple aspects of the environment can influence small groups of animals in profound and complex ways. In the first three chapters, I report on experiments showing how small changes in the environment can affect the expression of behavior at different points in development and can have important physiological consequences for litters of mouse pups. I then report on two sets of experiments showing how subtle changes in the environment can dramatically affect spacing patterns and social dynamics of small groups of adult zebrafish. Together, my results emphasize the ways that subtle changes in the environment can have profound impacts on individuals and small groups. In both lines of work, I have found that a more accurate characterization of the phenomena, infant rodent development and zebrafish social behavior, requires the use of individual and group measures and that temperature, density, and pollutants can have a powerful effect on group responses. These results are important because they show that the physical environment can have profound effects on the phenotype, and that with a changing physical environment or anthropogenic change, dramatic differences may be observed in the behavior of groups.},

	abstract = {Understanding the ecological and evolutionary forces that determine the genetic structure and spread of invasive species is a key component of invasion biology. The bay barnacle, Balanus improvisus (= Amphibalanus improvisus), is one of the most successful aquatic invaders worldwide, and is characterised by broad environmental tolerance. Although the species can spread through natural larval dispersal, human-mediated transport through (primarily) shipping has almost certainly contributed to the current global distribution of this species. Despite its worldwide distribution, little is known about the phylogeography of this species. Here, we characterize the population genetic structure and model dispersal dynamics of the barnacle B. improvisus, and describe how human-mediated spreading via shipping as well as natural larval dispersal may have contributed to observed genetic variation. We used both mitochondrial DNA (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I: COI) and nuclear microsatellites to characterize the genetic structure in 14 populations of B. improvisus on a global and regional scale (Baltic Sea). Genetic diversity was high in most populations, and many haplotypes were shared among populations on a global scale, indicating that long-distance dispersal (presumably through shipping and other anthropogenic activities) has played an important role in shaping the population genetic structure of this cosmopolitan species. We could not clearly confirm prior claims that B. improvisus originates from the western margins of the Atlantic coasts; although there were indications that Argentina could be part of a native region. In addition to dispersal via shipping, we show that natural larval dispersal may play an important role for further colonisation following initial introduction.},

Early detection and rapid response depend on prioritizing and monitoring sites at risk for arrival or secondary spread of nonindigenous species. Such monitoring efforts require sufficient biosecurity budgets to be effective and meet management or policy directives for reduced risk of introduction. Such consideration of risk reduction is rarely considered, however. Here, we review the concepts of acceptable level of risk (ALOR) and associated costs with respect to nonindigenous species and present a framework for aligning risk reduction priorities with available biosecurity resources. We conclude that available biosecurity resources may be insufficient to attain stated and desired risk reduction. This outcome highlights the need to consider policy and management directives when beginning a biosecurity program to determine the feasibility of risk reduction goals, given available resources.},

In parts of the developing world, such as China, similar efforts are beginning to gather the same type of momentum. Within the past decade, the Huangpu River, which flows through Shanghai into the Yangtze Estuary of China, has been a target for ecological restoration and management. It is possible to draw parallels between the cleanup efforts involved in improving the environmental conditions of the Huangpu and Hudson Rivers. Using the methodologies of series comparison (SCM), water quality index (WQI) modeling, consideration of ecological engineering, and policy strategy design, we comparatively studied the topography, functions, environmental conditions, ecological engineering countermeasures, and management policies of the two rivers to assist future forecasting of ecological restoration efforts in China.},

The Fauna Europaea project covers about 230, 000 taxonomic names, including 130, 000 accepted species and 14, 000 accepted subspecies, which is much more than the originally projected number of 100, 000 species. This represents a huge effort by more than 400 contributing specialists throughout Europe and is a unique (standard) reference suitable for many users in science, government, industry, nature conservation and education. For the Mollusca - Bivalvia, data from 5 families ( Margaritiferidae, Unionidae, Sphaeriidae, Cyrenidae, Dreissenidae ) containing 55 species are included in this paper. European freshwater bivalves belong to the Orders Unionoida and Cardiida. All the European unionoids are included in the superfamily Unionoidea, the freshwater mussels or naiads. The European cardiids belong to the following three superfamilies: Cardioidea, Cyrenoidea and Dreissenoidea. Among the Unionoidea there are the most imperilled animal groups on the planet while the Cardioidea includes the cosmopolitan genus  Pisidium , the Cyrenoidea the Asiatic clam ( Corbicula fluminea  ) and the Dreissenoidea the famous invasive zebra mussel ( Dreissena polymorpha  ). Basic information is summarized on their taxonomy and biology. Tabulations include a complete list of the current estimated families, genera and species.},

	abstract = {Whatever their size and the ecosystem they live in, all organisms may disperse at some stage of their life cycle. Dispersal dynamics are to a varying extent dependent on organismal size, life history, ecological niche, survival capacities and phylogeny. Moves towards a synthesis in dispersal ecology have focused primarily on vertebrates and higher plants, yet recent studies suggest that the dispersal of microorganisms and macroorganisms has much more in common than previously assumed. The dispersal of one organism enables co-dispersal for many others, smaller in size. There is an increasing need for a more integrated approach to study dispersal within the context of organismal interactions and their environments. Such an approach is facilitated by recent developments of powerful indirect techniques that enable tracking of microorganisms and macroorganisms over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Likewise, dispersal modelling and theoretical models of the consequences of dispersal can inspire empirical studies across the entire size spectrum. Simultaneously studying the relationships between dispersal of microorganisms and macroorganisms, and accounting for dispersal through time and space, will allow us to better understand the functioning and dynamics of communities and ecosystems, and to make better predictions of future dispersal patterns, changes in biodiversity and connectivity.},

It is likely that probiotics and aquatic microbiology will play a key role also in freshwater bivalves larval rearing.

	abstract = {Chapter 1 of this thesis describes the historical development and application of size-structured models and their role in modeling the population dynamics of biological systems. Chapter 2 presents a general model for the interaction of a size-structured population with its environment. The vital rates of the individuals are assumed to depend on a number of variables including the total population and the environment. A nonstandard finite difference approximation is developed for the general model and the convergence of the scheme to the unique weak solution of the nonlinear system of partial differential equations coupled with ordinary differential equations is established. Potential applications are presented in various fields ranging from shared resource dynamics to invasive species. Chapter 3 presents a first order finite difference scheme for phytoplankton dynamics subject to a vector of environmental variables in a well-mixed reactor. The biophysical problem yields a nonlinear partial differential equation coupled with a general system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations which represent the time-varying environmental conditions in the water column. Convergence results are established for the coupled system using the finite difference method. Numerical trials are presented to illustrate the performance of the model against a real dataset. Taking into account the combined effects of aggregate growth and coagulation, the model is used to investigate the role of the active fraction of the cell aggregate on algal bloom dynamics and nutrient consumption rates. The model is well-suited to complement microcosm studies and can accommodate the effects of a wide range of environmental conditions. Chapter 4 summarizes the main results, research and practical challenges associated with the application of general size-structured models, and suggestions for future work.},

	abstract = {Sagartia ornata is an alien anemone that occurs intertidally within the West Coast National Park (WCNP). The present study aimed to determine the current status and distribution of this anemone, to assess its diet so as to establish the role it may play as predator and to investigate its impact on sandy-shore communities. Sagartia ornata was found to be restricted to the WCNP, where it occurred in densities of up to 508 ± 218 individuals per m{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum}. Populations were recorded in Nanozostera capensis seagrass beds for the first time and this alien was absent from two areas in which it had previously occurred. It is concluded that whilst this anemone negatively affects native biota, its current dependence on restricted habitats precludes widespread impacts with the park. With regard to conservation implications, this invasion should be routinely monitored outside the WCNP as in its native range S. ornata occurs on rocky shores and kelp holdfasts, suggesting a potential for spread along the west coast of South Africa.},

I propose an alternative method for calculating location using a standardized geographic buffer. Simulations to test the applicability of the buffer were conducted in ArcGIS using distribution data, scale of the primary threat, and minimum area for viable population for 20 imperiled freshwater fish species of southern Ontario. The shape of the buffer is dependent on the species habitat and the primary threat to the species. My proposed objective method of calculating location will contribute to more accurate conservation assessments of species, and subsequent development and implementation of conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {In its first English-language edition, this book introduces the many-faceted interactions of animal populations with their habitats. From soil fauna, ants and termites to small and large herbivores, burrowing mammals and birds, the author presents a comprehensive analysis of animals and ecosystems that is as broad and varied as all nature. 
Chapter 2 addresses the functional role of animals in landscape ecosystems, emphasizing fluxes of energy and matter within and between ecosystems, and the effects of animals on qualitative and structural habitat change. Discussion includes chapters on the role of animal population density and the impacts of native herbivores on vegetation and habitats from the tropics to the polar regions. Cyclic mass outbreaks of species such as the larch bud moth in Switzerland, the mountain pine beetle and the African red-billed weaver bird are described and analyzed. Other chapters discuss Zoochory - the dispersal of seeds by ants, mammals and birds - and the influence of burrowing animals on soil development and geomorphology. Consideration extends to the impact of feral domestic animals.
Chapter 5 focuses on problems resulting from introduction of alien animals and from re-introduction of animal species to their original habitats, discusses the effects on ecosystems of burrowing, digging and trampling by animals. The author also addresses keystone species such as kangaroo rats, termites and beavers.
Chapter 6 addresses the role of animals in landscape management and nature conservation, with chapters on the impact of newcomer species such as animals introduced into Australia, New Zealand and Europe, and the consequences of reintroduction of species to original habitat. It also discusses the carrying capacity of natural habit, public attitudes toward conversation and more.
The final section ponders the effects of climate on interactions between animals and their habitats.Addresses the functional role of animals in landscape ecosystems and the practical implications for landscape management and nature conservation Assesses the role of animals with special regard to the specific local socio-cultural and economic conditions Includes a section on climate change effects on animal-habitat interactions Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras},

	abstract = {The commercial bait trade is one pathway for aquatic invasive species (AIS) introductions, as non-target bait species can be accidentally sold to anglers who either inadvertently or intentionally release them while fishing or as excess bait. Prevention of AIS introductions via the bait trade requires a two-tiered management approach, which includes both regulation of the bait industry and angler education. Retail bait shops may offer opportunities for public education regarding AIS, however it is unknown how often shops are targeted for such purposes and how viable this method of angler education is on a temporal scale. The goals of this research were to 1) quantify the current distribution of AIS signage in retail bait shops in the Great Lakes region and 2) estimate the long term viability of using retail bait shops as platform for angler education. Additionally, we present an up-to-date summary of bait industry regulations across the Great Lakes jurisdictions. Of the 525 bait shops visited in 2012 and 2013, 22\% displayed some form of AIS educational materials or signage.

The presented summary of bait regulations for Great Lakes jurisdictions indicates multiple discrepancies across the region, which may hinder successful management strategies.

	abstract = {Readers familiar with the first three editions of Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates (edited by J.H. Thorp and A.P. Covich) will welcome the comprehensive revision and expansion of the trusted professional reference manual and educational textbook, from a single North American tome into a developing multi-volume series covering inland water invertebrates of the world. The series entitled Thorp and Covich's Freshwater Invertebrates (edited by J.H. Thorp) begins with the current Volume I: Ecology and General Biology (edited by J.H. Thorp and D.C. Rogers), which is designed as a companion volume for the remaining books in the series. Those following volumes provide taxonomic coverage for specific zoogeographic regions of the world, starting with Keys to Nearctic Fauna (Vol. II) and Keys to Palaearctic Fauna (Vol. III). Volume I maintains the ecological and general biological focus of the previous editions but now expands coverage globally in all chapters, includes more taxonomic groups (e.g., chapters on individual insect orders), and covers additional functional topics such as invasive species, economic impacts, and functional ecology. As in previous editions, the 4th edition of Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates is designed for use by professionals in universities, government agencies, and private companies as well as by undergraduate and graduate students. 
Key Features of Volume I: . Global coverage of aquatic invertebrate ecology. . Discussions on invertebrate ecology, phylogeny, and general biology written by international experts for each group. . Separate chapters on invasive species and economic impacts and uses of invertebrates.
New to this Series Edition . Eight additional chapters on insect orders and a chapter on freshwater millipedes. . Four new chapters on collecting and culturing techniques, ecology of invasive species, economic impacts, and ecological function of invertebrates. . Overall expansion of ecology and general biology and a shift of the even more detailed taxonomic keys to other volumes in the projected multi-volume series. . Identification keys to lower taxonomic levels.
Also from Elsevier J.H. Thorp \& D.C. Rogers. 2010. Field Guide to Freshwater Invertebrates of North America. ISBN: 978-0-12-381426-5 The Field Guide to Freshwater Invertebrates of North America focuses on freshwater invertebrates that can be identified using at most an inexpensive magnifying glass. Consequently, the taxonomic level and overall biological coverage are not as detailed as in Thorp and Covich's Freshwater Invertebrates. This Guide is useful for experienced and amateur nature enthusiasts, college and high school students conducting class projects or going on field trips, and anglers looking for the best fish bait, lure, or fly.The only up-to-date reference work for covering the ecology, classification, and identification of freshwater aquatic invertebrates of the world.Dr. James H. Thorp has been a Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Kansas (Lawrence, KS, USA) and a Senior Scientist in the Kansas Biological Survey since 2001. Prior to returning to his alma mater, Prof. Thorp was a Distinguished Professor and Dean at Clarkson University, Department Chair and Professor at the University of Louisville, Associate Professor and Director of the Calder Ecology Center of Fordham University, Visiting Associate Professor at Cornell, and Research Ecologist at the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Laboratory. He received his Baccalaureate from the University of Kansas (KU) and both Masters and Ph.D. degrees from North Carolina State. Those degrees focused on zoology, ecology, and marine biology, with an emphasis on the ecology of freshwater and marine invertebrates. Dr. Thorp is currently on the editorial board of two journals (River Research and Applications and River Systems) and is a former President of the International Society for River Science. He teaches freshwater, marine, and general ecological courses at KU, and his Masters and doctoral graduate students work on various aspects of the ecology of organisms, communities, and ecosystems in rivers, reservoirs, and wetlands. Prof. Thorp's research interests and background are highly diverse and span the gamut from organismal biology to community, ecosystem, and macrosystem ecology. He works on both fundamental and applied research topics using descriptive, experimental, and modeling approaches in the field and lab. While his research emphasizes aquatic invertebrates, he also studies fish ecology, especially as related to food webs. He has published more than one hundred refereed journal articles, books, and chapters, including three single-volume editions of Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates (edited by J.H. Thorp and A.P. Covich) and the first volume (Ecology and General Biology) in the current fourth edition.

	abstract = {Biological invasions by non-indigenous species are considered a leading threat to biodiversity, with prevention being a key management strategy. Consequently, numerous commercial ballast water treatment systems have been, or are being, developed to prevent future aquatic invasions. However, most treatment systems are being designed for the many vessels undertaking long transoceanic voyages in marine waters rather than the relatively few vessels operating on short voyages in freshwater, such as those in the Laurentian Great Lakes. Here we conduct testing of the biological efficacy of a 40 µm ballast water filtration unit through shipboard trials. We test the hypotheses that i) filtration will significantly reduce abundance of zooplankton greater than 50 µm in size but not phytoplankton 10 to 50 µm in size; ii) filtration will reduce zooplankton abundances in ballast water below International Maritime Organization discharge standards, but not those of phytoplankton; and iii) filtration will alter the community composition of zooplankton, non-randomly reducing invasion risk of larger taxa. During the summer of 2012, three shipboard trials were conducted. Ballast water samples were collected using a before-after experimental design. Our study showed that filtration significantly reduced abundance of copepods and cladocerans, but not of juvenile dreissenid veligers and rotifers. Contrary to our expectation, phytoplankton densities were also significantly lower after the treatment. Overall, ballast water treated during our tests would not meet proposed international discharge standards. Filtration altered relative abundance of zooplankton, but did not reduce introduction risk of any taxonomic group due to the small juvenile stages and dormant eggs which passed through the treatment. While we do not rule out filtration as a ballast water treatment option for zooplankton in the future, our tests indicate further development is required for meaningful reduction of invasion risk.},

	abstract = {While considerable variation exists in ecological and economic impacts among nonindigenous species (NIS), the potential magnitude of cumulative impacts for each species increases with increasing area occupied. In the marine environment, large commercial ships have often transferred NIS across ocean basins to new continents. However, following such initial invasions, small craft (recreational and fishing boats) likely play an important role in the secondary, coastwise spread of NIS, thus increasing the geographic range and potential magnitude of impact. In this study, we assess the connectivity among bays in terms of small vessel movement and associated biofouling organisms in central California (USA), examining flux between a heavily invaded international port, San Francisco Bay (SFB), and three small marinas on the adjacent coast. We estimated vessel flux among locations, using data from 405 boater questionnaires and 4,000 transient boat records, and found a strong bi-directional connection between SFB and the nearby coastal marinas. Video surveys of 36 boats that had recently traveled revealed macrofauna on the underwater surfaces on 80\% of boats, and at least 27 taxa (including 7 NIS) were present on boats sampled by SCUBA. Importantly, while we provide evidence for strong connectivity, our data most certainly underestimate the flux of vessels and cumulative transfers of organisms among these locations during this short-term study, as vessel movement data are incomplete and surveys are limited even in this small region. This study underscores the opportunities for biofouling organisms, many with limited self-dispersal capacity, to spread via small boats and suggests that effective management strategies to minimize NIS spread and impacts must address the small-boat vector.},

	abstract = {Invasive European frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L.) has negative environmental and economic impacts in North American water bodies. It is therefore important to develop effective management tools to control this invasive species. This study investigated shading as a control method for European frogbit in both greenhouse and lake mesocosm experiments. A series of shade treatments (0\%, 50\%, 60\%, 70\%, 80\%, and 100\%) were tested in the greenhouse for three weeks. Results showed that the 100\% shade was most effective at controlling European frogbit, and other shade treatments greater than 50\% were less effective, reducing frogbit biomass up to 38.2\%. There were no differences found in temperature between treatments, but dissolved oxygen decreased as shading increased. A lake mesocosm experiment utilizing 0\% shade, 70\% shade, and 100\% shade treatments was performed in a sheltered inlet of Oneida Lake in New York State for over one month. Resulting European frogbit biomass was significantly (25 times) less in areas treated with the 70\% shade and nearly zero with the 100\% shade. Shading did not affect temperature but improved DO conditions. Results on the shading effects on submerged macrophytes were not conclusive: no significant differences in changes in species richness and abundance between the three groups at the end of studied period suggested no shading effects; significant differences between the beginning and end communities in the 70\% shade and the 100\% shade but not in the control group indicated significant impacts of shading. This study is the first one to investigate shading as a control method for European frogbit and it is concluded that a moderately high density shade can effective remove European frogbit likely with minor impacts on the environment. More experiments with larger scales and longer time periods are recommended for further investigation.},

We assessed the relationship between the biomass of lionfish and native predators at 71 reefs in three biogeographic regions while taking into consideration several cofactors that may affect fish abundance, including among others, proxies for fishing pressure and habitat structural complexity. Our results indicate that the abundance of lionfish, large-bodied grouper and other predators were not negatively related. Lionfish abundance was instead controlled by several physical site characteristics, and possibly by culling. Taken together, our results suggest that managers cannot rely on current native grouper populations to control the lionfish invasion.},

We identified linkages in a case study of the Lake St. Clair (LSC) region, part of the Laurentian Great Lakes system. Our research phases included: (1) investigating and revising existing coupled human and natural systems frameworks to develop a framework for this case study; (2) testing and refining the framework by hosting a 1-day stakeholder workshop and (3) creating a causal loop diagram (CLD) to illustrate the relationships among the systems' key components. With stakeholder assistance, we identified four interrelated pathways that include water use and discharge, land use, tourism and shipping that impact the ecological condition of LSC. The interrelationships between the pathways of water use and tourism are further illustrated by a CLD with several feedback loops. We suggest that this holistic approach can be applied to other case studies and inspire the development of dynamic models capable of informing decision making for sustainability.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Here we re-evaluated the hypothesis that native large-bodied grouper and other predators are controlling the abundance of exotic lionfish (Pterois volitans/miles) on Caribbean coral reefs. We assessed the relationship between the biomass of lionfish and native predators at 71 reefs in three biogeographic regions while taking into consideration several cofactors that may affect fish abundance, including among others, proxies for fishing pressure and habitat structural complexity. Our results indicate that the abundance of lionfish, large-bodied grouper and other predators were not negatively related. Lionfish abundance was instead controlled by several physical site characteristics, and possibly by culling. Taken together, our results suggest that managers cannot rely on current native grouper populations to control the lionfish invasion.},

	abstract = {Extreme overall divergence and high extinction rates are typical of insular endemics. Thus, detecting and understanding nativeness is critical on islands. Resilience to extinction is explored through a mechanistic approach focusing on midwife toads (Anura: Alytidae: Alytinae), an ancient lineage that includes continental and insular species. All alytines need urgent conservation action, including control of emerging diseases and spatially explicit reserve design aimed at ensuring ecosystem health and connectivity. The only extant insular alytine is additionally affected by an introduced continental predator. This alien species acts as a driver of the prey's near-extinction and has not elicited any evolutionary response. Both IUCN criteria and EDGE scores show that alytines are top conservation priorities. However, there is a need for also considering phenotypic and ecological uniqueness in the assessment of conservation status and urgency. The reason is that phenotypes render ecosystems functional and insular ones uniquely so. In contrast, phylogenetic relatedness is just a constraint upon, not a motor of, evolutionary novelty. Insular species are indeed particularly susceptible, but can be similarly endangered as continental ones. This paradox may be solved by recognizing the insularity syndrome in any isolated or nearly-insular ecosystem, as a function of evolutionary and dispersal potentials. This predictive model may be useful for island biogeography, invasion biology and conservation planning.},

	abstract = {The southeastern US has experienced recurrent drought during recent decades. Increasing demand for water, as precipitation decreases, exacerbates stress on the aquatic biota of the Southeast: a global hotspot for freshwater mussel, crayfish, and fish diversity. Freshwater unionid mussels are ideal candidates to study linkages between ecophysiological and behavioral responses to drought. Previous work on co-occurring mussel species suggests a coupling of physiology and behavior along a gradient ranging from intolerant species such as Pyganodon grandis (giant floater) that track receding waters and rarely burrow in the substrates to tolerant species such as Uniomerus tetralasmus (pondhorn) that rarely track receding waters, but readily burrow into the drying sediments. We utilized a next-generation sequencing-based RNA-Seq approach to examine heat/desiccation-induced transcriptomic profiles of these two species in order to identify linkages between patterns of gene expression, physiology and behavior. Sequencing produced over 425 million 100 bp reads. Using the de novo assembly package Trinity, we assembled the short reads into 321,250 contigs from giant floater (average length 835 bp) and 385,735 contigs from pondhorn (average length 929 bp). BLAST-based annotation and gene expression analysis revealed 2,832 differentially expressed genes in giant floater and 2,758 differentially expressed genes in pondhorn. Trancriptomic responses included changes in molecular chaperones, oxidative stress profiles, cell cycling, energy metabolism, immunity, and cytoskeletal rearrangements. Comparative analyses between species indicated significantly higher induction of molecular chaperones and cytoskeletal elements in the intolerant P. grandis as well as important differences in genes regulating apoptosis and immunity.},

	abstract = {Water quality problems, as a result of human activities, have become a worldwide concern.  Excess nitrogen and phosphorus entering waters from crop runoff, treated sewage plant effluent, and other industrial sources are leading to increased eutrophication in lakes and "dead zones" in oceans.  High levels of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus can cause algal blooms that result in decreased dissolved oxygen levels.  When the blooms consist of cyanobacteria, the problem is even worse.  These bacteria form a toxic secondary metabolite that can harm or kill fish and other vertebrates.   When nitrogen in a lake is limited, some cyanobacteria can "fix" their own from the atmosphere, so phosphorus pollution is the main contributing factor to cyanobacterial blooms.  The problem is being addressed globally by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), nationally by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and locally by communities and concerned citizens.    When the Watershed Nature Center (WNC) began, the plan was to restore the biodiversity of an ecosystem and to create a functioning wetland.  In order to do this, a certain level of water quality is needed.  Once established, the ongoing success or failure of this restoration project would be measured through water quality study and analysis.  This is the purpose of this study.  To evaluate this quality, measurements of field parameters including dissolved oxygen, water pH and temperature were taken at several locations.  Water grab samples were collected at a water inflow and outflow point.  They were also collected at stationary points in the two ponds of the WNC.  The study examined variations in the nitrogen to phosphorus levels as a result of rain.  Results indicated that, as a whole, the amount of rain does not have a statistically-significant effect on the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus.   The degree to which levels of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved solids (TDS) and water pH were affected by locations in the lakes, and seasons were also examined.  In the entire lake ecosystem, the highest ratio of TN:TP was in the autumn and lowest was in summer.  These results supported the hypothesis that the levels change with the seasons.  The variables were compared from their level at input sites to their levels at output to determine if the Watershed Nature Center is acting as a nutrient sink.  The results showed evidence of some nutrient trapping, especially of phosphorus.  Correlation analysis suggested that the variation in phosphorus and total dissolved solids may be driven by variation of these constituents in water inflows.},

	abstract = {The Indo-Pacific coral Tubastraea micranthus recently invaded a region near the Mississippi River mouth, Gulf of Mexico, and its populations have been expanding. Its congener, Tubastraea coccinea, invaded during the 1940s and is now common in the western Atlantic. Accessibility is important in determining whether an invasive species can be controlled/eradicated. In the marine environment, depth limits accessibility. We assessed the depth distribution of T. micranthus and T. coccinea on 15 oil/gas platforms using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Pooled data indicated that T. micranthus extends to 138 m and probably deeper, while T. coccinea is generally limited to {\textless} 78 m. Average depths for T. micranthus were shallower west of the Mississippi River, in its plume, and deeper towards the east. Tubastraea coccinea exhibited a similar geographic depth-distribution pattern, but shallower and subtler. Broad geographic patterns were similar whether using density or percent-cover data for analysis. When considering individual platforms, T. micranthus often reached the bottom and sometimes occurred at depths {\textgreater}138 m. Tubastraea coccinea were limited to shallow waters on all platforms. Detailed depth distribution patterns varied significantly between analyses using density and percent-cover data, with density probably indicating colonization rates, and percent-cover colony growth. Depth limitation by T. coccinea may be associated with food availability rather than light since it is azooxanthellate. The occurrence of T. micranthus in deep water will most likely make any control or eradication efforts difficult, due to cost and a rapid rate of population expansion.},

In addition, however, the Rouge highlights the intersecting question of plant/human relations, specifically concerning the rapid spread of the so-called aggressive invasive species dog-strangling vine (Cynanchum rossicum, known as DSV) in many portions of the park. DSV acutely calls into question ideas of nature and nation undergirding Parks Canada's mandate, and in so doing, demands that we attend to the actual physical and political history of the Rouge, the ways that history has afforded DSV with ideal conditions for its flourishing, the limits of current biopolitical discourses of invasive species management, and, for the new Rouge Park, the need for a more thoughtful, respectful, democratic approach to plant/human relations and to larger questions about what an urban park might be.

Another significant threat has been the invasive Zebra Mussel, perhaps the most damaging to our native bivalves, as well as to human infrastructure such as intake pipes. It appeared in the Great Lakes in 1988 on ships from Middle Europe. Of incredible reproductive capacity, one female can produce 30,000 to 1,000,000 larvae annually. Madill noted that mussells of the Rideau River have suffered a 'double whammy' from zebra mussells and the rapid and alternating water levels due to the canal locks. In 10 years, zebra mussells have spread throughout the Great Lakes smothering large beds of native bivalves.},

It appeared in the Great Lakes in 1988 on ships from Middle Europe. Of incredible reproductive capacity, one female can produce 30,000 to 1,000,000 larvae annually. Madill noted that mussells of the Rideau River have suffered a 'double whammy' from zebra mussells and the rapid and alternating water levels due to the canal locks. In 10 years, zebra mussells have spread throughout the Great Lakes smothering large beds of native bivalves.},

	abstract = {Marine mussels of the genus Perna include three species: P. canaliculus, P. viridis and P. perna. While P. canaliculus appears to be greatly restricted to its endemic range of New Zealand, P. perna and P. viridis introductions have been recorded outside their native ranges in several regions of the globe. Such introductions have often resulted in significant negative ecological, economic and social impacts. Perna perna and P. viridis are exotic to Australia and are listed under the Australian Government National System for the Prevention and Management of Marine Pest Incursions as high priority species. Rapid detection of marine pests such as Perna species remains fundamental to their effective containment and control. The present study reports on the development and validation of both conventional and real-time PCR assays suited to the rapid identification and discrimination of juvenile and adult specimens of P. viridis, P. canaliculus and P. perna. The development of a sensitive high-throughput real-time PCR assay offers further potential for the efficient detection of the presence of single Perna specimens in mixed populations of native mussel species, and for early detection of larval stages in ballast water and plankton samples. This assay offers considerable advantages over traditional identification methods and represents an important step in developing capacity for efficient identification and management of Perna species incursions in Australian waters.},

	abstract = {Daily food requirements scale with body mass and activity in animals. While small species of birds have higher mass-specific field metabolic rates than larger species, larger species have higher absolute energy costs. Under energy balance, we thus expect the small species to have a higher energy value diet. Also the weight and time constraints for flighted and diurnal foragers should set a maximum to the amount of prey items taken in one meal and to the daily number of meals, respectively. Further, avoidance of competition causes the species to reduce the amount of shared prey in their diet. Some diet segregation is therefore to be expected between species. We tested these hypotheses and investigated the role of body mass in the diet composition of 12 sea duck species (Somateria mollissima, Somateria spectabilis, Somateria fischeri, Polysticta stelleri, Bucephala clangula, Bucephala islandica, Bucephala albeola, Melanitta nigra, Melanitta perspicillata, Melanitta deglandi, Histrionicus histrionicus and Clangula hyemalis) wintering in North America. This study was based on a literature survey with special emphasis given to the diet data from the former US Bureau of Biological Survey. The data supported our hypothesis that the energy value of winter diet of sea ducks scales negatively with body mass. Diet diversity also scaled negatively with body mass. Our results suggest the existence of a minimum for the energy value of avian diets.},

	abstract = {Although the study of environmental change has long been of academic interest, the effects of change have become a much more pressing concern in the past few decades due to the often disruptive effect of human expansion and innovation. Researchers from many fields contribute to understanding our footprint on the natural world, problems we cause, and strategies we can employ to protect key species and ecosystems. Unfortunately, environmental change and its consequences are often studied without an awareness of the inherent attributes of the changes. As a result, the relevance of new advances in this field may be easily missed or misunderstood, and existing knowledge is not optimally applied. In this paper, we aim to facilitate the multi-disciplinary comparison of studies on environmental change, by offering a meta-level perspective on the process of change from the point of view of the individual animal. We propose an inclusive definition of change that can be applied across contexts, in which we take our understanding of "change" from an event to an interaction between a physical occurrence and an individual's state. Furthermore, we discuss key event- and individual-based attributes of change, their relevance in today's changing world, and how they relate to animals' available behavioural, physiological and cross-generational responses. We hope that by uncovering the underlying fundamental (or structure) of change, fellow scientists may better share their experience and knowledge gained from years of studying individual species and situations.},

	abstract = {Background Trichocorixa verticalis verticalis, a native of North America, is the only alien corixid identified in Europe. First detected in 1997 in southern Portugal, it has spread into south-west Spain including Doñana National Park. Its impact on native taxa in the same area is unclear, but it is the dominant species in several permanent, saline wetlands. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated whether the ecophysiology of this alien species favours its spread in the Iberian Peninsula and its relative success in saline areas. We compared physiological responses to heating (Critical Thermal maximum), cooling (Critical Thermal minimum) and freezing (Super Cooling Point) in the native Sigara lateralis and introduced T. v. verticalis acclimated to different temperatures and salinities. The larger S. lateralis generally outperformed T. v. verticalis and appeared to possess a broader thermal tolerance range. In both taxa, CTmax was highest in animals exposed to a combination of high conductivities and relatively low acclimation temperatures. However, CTmax was generally higher in T. v. verticalis and lower in S. lateralis when acclimated at higher temperatures. CTmin were lower (greater tolerance to cold) after acclimation to high conductivities in T. v. verticalis, and following acclimation to low conductivities in S. lateralis. Both acclimation temperature and conductivity influenced corixids' freezing tolerance; however, only in T. v. verticalis did SCP decrease after exposure to both high temperature and conductivity. T. v. verticalis showed a higher range of mean responses over all treatments. Conclusions Whilst the native S. lateralis may have a broader thermal range, the alien species performs particularly well at higher salinities and temperatures and this ability may facilitate its invasion in Mediterranean areas. The greater plasticity of T. v. verticalis may further facilitate its spread in the future, as it may be more able to respond to climate shifts than the native species.},

	abstract = {Following the much acclaimed success of the first volume of 
Key Topics in Conservation Biology, this entirely new second volume addresses an innovative array of key topics in contemporary conservation biology.  Written by an internationally renowned team of authors,
Key Topics in Conservation Biology 2 adds to the still topical foundations laid in the first volume (published in 2007) by exploring a further 25 cutting-edge issues in modern biodiversity conservation, including controversial subjects such as setting conservation priorities, balancing the focus on species and ecosystems, and financial mechanisms to value biodiversity and pay for its conservation. Other chapters, setting the framework for conservation, address the sociology and philosophy of peoples' relation with Nature and its impact on health, and such challenging practical issues as wildlife trade and conflict between people and carnivores. As a new development, this second volume of Key Topics includes chapters on major ecosystems, such as forests, islands and both fresh and marine waters, along with case studies of the conservation of major taxa: plants, butterflies, birds and mammals. A further selection of topics consider how to safeguard the future through monitoring, reserve planning, corridors and connectivity, together with approaches to reintroduction and re-wilding, along with managing wildlife disease. A final chapter, by the editors, synthesises thinking on the relationship between biodiversity conservation and human development.
Each topic is explored by a team of top international experts, assembled to bring their own cross-cutting knowledge to a penetrating synthesis of the issues from both theoretical and practical perspectives.
The interdisciplinary nature of biodiversity conservation is reflected throughout the book. Each essay examines the fundamental principles of the topic, the methodologies involved and, crucially, the human dimension. In this way, Key Topics in Conservation Biology 2, like its sister volume,
Key Topics in Conservation Biology, embraces issues from cutting-edge ecological science to policy, environmental economics, governance, ethics, and the practical issues of implementation.

Key Topics in Conservation Biology 2 will, like its sister volume, be a valuable resource in universities and colleges, government departments, and conservation agencies. It is aimed particularly at senior undergraduate and graduate students in conservation biology and wildlife management and wider ecological and environmental subjects, and those taking Masters degrees in any field relevant to conservation and the environment. Conservation practitioners, policy-makers, and the wider general public eager to understand more about important environmental issues will also find this book invaluable.

In 1997, a consortium of scientific organizations including SCOPE, IUCN, and CABI developed the Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP) with the explicit objective of providing new tools for understanding and coping with invasive alien species. Invasive Alien Species is the final report of GISP's first phase of operation, 1997-2000, in which authorities from more than thirty countries worked to examine invasions as a worldwide environmental hazard. The book brings together the world's leading scientists and researchers involved with invasive alien species to offer a comprehensive summary and synthesis of the currstate of knowledge on the subject. Invasive alien species represa critical threat to natural ecosystems and native biodiversity, as well as to human economic vitality and health. The knowledge gained to date in understanding and combating invasive alien species can form a useful basis on which to build strategies for controlling or minimizing the effects in the future.

	abstract = {Through ratification of the Water Framework Directive (WFD), EU Member States committed themselves to a pressure-based assessment of the ecological status of their water bodies. Invasive alien species (IAS) constitute a major pressure in many aquatic ecosystems, yet are not explicitly accounted for by the majority of WFD assessment methods. Most Member States argue that no explicit assessment of IAS is required, assuming that significant IAS pressures will affect the WFD biological quality elements (BQEs), and be detected by generic WFD status assessments. We tested this assumption for a selection of country-by-surface-water category combinations, covering nearly 40,000 water bodies. For each of the combinations, the pressure by high-impact IAS is higher in water bodies with ecological status varying from bad to moderate than in water bodies in good or high ecological status. Most high-impact IAS show strong associations with low status class categories. Of the 17 most frequently occurring high-impact IAS, only Mustela vison (Schreber, 1777) and Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1853) are disproportionately frequent in high status water bodies. The sensitivity of WFD methods varies across BQEs, with macrophyte-based methods showing a consistently high sensitivity to IAS pressures. However, significant pressures are observed in a number of high status water bodies. This points to a need for further optimization of existing methods so that they address the full range of pressures exerted by IAS.},

We evaluate the pros and cons of a range of methods, including references to examples of the methods in practice. We also show how issues of data deficiency and uncertainty can be addressed. The aim is to provide guidance to the reader on the most suitable elements to include in a model of post-entry dispersal in a risk assessment, under differing circumstances. We identify both the strengths and weaknesses of different methods and their application as part of a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to biosecurity research.},

	abstract = {Nitrification is a prokaryote-mediated oxygen consumptive process of the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite/nitrate that traditionally has been only viewed as a nutrient transformation process. Renewed concern about hypoxia in the shallow hypolimnion of the Central Basin of Lake Erie provides impetus for examining whether nitrification has a significant impact on oxygen dynamics. To evaluate the contribution of nitrification to oxygen demand, water column and sediment samples were collected during the summers of 2008-2010 in Lake Erie and the oxygen consumption due to nitrification and the abundance and distribution of potential bacterial (AOB) and archaeal (AOA) that oxidize ammonia to nitrite was characterized in water column and sediment samples by qPCR of a portion of the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene. Environmental variables and nitrification rates were examined for correlations to understand factors that may control nitrification rates and/or the distribution of nitrifiers. The nitrification rate in the epilimnion and hypolimnion was 3.1 ± 3.2 micromole N/L/day and 3.7 ± 2.9 (mean ± 1 SD) micromole oxygen/L/day respectively. Nitrification accounted for 28.2 ± 23.1\% of the total oxygen consumption in the epilimnion and 32.6 ± 22.2\% in the hypolimnion. Oxygen consumption by nitrification in sediment slurries and intact sediment cores was 7.1 ± 5.8 micromole oxygen/gram/day and 682 ± 61.1 micromole oxygen/square m/day respectively. Nitrification accounted for 27.0 ± 19.2\% of the total oxygen consumption in sediment slurries and 30.4 ± 10.7\% in intact sediment cores. AOA and AOB were present in all samples, with a distribution that was variable over time and space. Highlighting the potential importance of archaeal nitrifiers, the AOA/AOB ratio in the epilimnion, hypolimnion, and sediments was 1.02, 1.08, and 5.25. The nitrification rate or nitrifier numbers did not strongly correlate with environmental factors such as oxygen, nitrate or ammonium. In the water column, respiration and the percentage of oxygen used due to nitrification were negatively correlated. While nitrification is unlikely to be the dominant oxygen consumptive process, the rates observed in Lake Erie were sufficient to theoretically deplete a large portion of the hypolimnetic oxygen pool during the stratified period.},

	abstract = {Doc number: 741              Abstract              Background: The Grooved Carpet shell clam Ruditapes decussatus  is the autochthonous European clam and the most appreciated from a gastronomic and economic point of view. The production is in decline due to several factors such as Perkinsiosis and habitat invasion and competition by the introduced exotic species, the manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum . After we sequenced R. decussatus  transcriptome we have designed an oligo microarray capable of contributing to provide some clues on molecular response of the clam to Perkinsiosis.              Results: A database consisting of 41,119 unique transcripts was constructed, of which 12,479 (30.3\%) were annotated by similarity. An oligo-DNA microarray platform was then designed and applied to profile gene expression in R. decussatus  heavily infected by Perkinsus olseni.  Functional annotation of differentially expressed genes between those two conditionswas performed by gene set enrichment analysis. As expected, microarrays unveil genes related with stress/infectious agents such as hydrolases, proteases and others. The extensive role of innate immune system was also analyzed and effect of parasitosis upon expression of important molecules such as lectins reviewed.              Conclusions: This study represents a first attempt to characterize Ruditapes decussatus  transcriptome, an important marine resource for the European aquaculture. The trancriptome sequencing and consequent annotation will increase the available tools and resources for this specie, introducing the possibility of high throughput experiments such as microarrays analysis. In this specific case microarray approach was used to unveil some important aspects of host-parasite interaction between the Carpet shell clam and Perkinsus , two non-model species, highlighting some genes associated with this interaction. Ample information was obtained to identify biological processes significantly enriched among differentially expressed genes in Perkinsus  infected versus non-infected gills. An overview on the genes related with the immune system on R. decussatus  transcriptome is also reported.},

In this study, we investigated virus strain-related variation in persistence in water for nine wild duck isolated IA viruses of three subtypes (H3N8, H4N6, and H8N4).              Results: We experimentally estimated the loss of infectivity over time in three different types of water: distilled, filtered surface water, and intact surface water. All viruses persisted longest in distilled water followed by filtered surface water with markedly reduced durations of persistence observed in the intact surface water. Strain-related variations were observed in distilled and filtered surface water but limited variation was observed in the intact surface water.              Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the role of surface water for long-term (between years) maintenance of AI viruses in the environment may be limited, and suggest that the physico-chemical characteristics of water, as well as microorganisms, may be of strong importance. Results also indicate that the extent of strain-related variation observed in distilled water may overestimate persistence abilities for IA viruses in the wild and supports the need to develop experiments that account for these effects to assess subtype, genotype, as well as spatial and temporal variation in the persistence of IA viruses in aquatic habitats.},

The biosphere--the Earth's thin layer of life--dates from nearly four billion years ago, when the first simple organisms appeared. Many species have exerted enormous influence on the biosphere's character and productivity, but none has transformed the Earth in so many ways and on such a scale as
Homo sapiens. In
Harvesting the Biosphere, Vaclav Smil offers an interdisciplinary and quantitative account of human claims on the biosphere's stores of living matter, from prehistory to the present day. Smil examines all harvests--from prehistoric man's hunting of megafauna to modern crop production--and all uses of harvested biomass, including energy, food, and raw materials. Without harvesting of the biomass, Smil points out, there would be no story of human evolution and advancing civilization; but at the same time, the increasing extent and intensity of present-day biomass harvests are changing the very foundations of civilization's well-being.
In his detailed and comprehensive account, Smil presents the best possible quantifications of past and current global losses in order to assess the evolution and extent of biomass harvests. Drawing on the latest work in disciplines ranging from anthropology to environmental science, Smil offers a valuable long-term, planet-wide perspective on human-caused environmental change.},

Twenty-one samples were taken from the right bank of the Uruguay River, from tributaries of the Uruguay and Paraná Rivers, the drainage of the Esteros del Ibera Wetland. Based on this fieldwork, the presence of larvae and adults of L. fortunei was determined. Also, through the comparison of environmental characteristic with the known tolerance limits for the species, the possibility of its establishment in environments not yet invaded was determined. Most of the sampling stations have features that allow the development of stable populations L. fortunei, including the rivers that drain the Esteros del Ibera, allowing access of this invasive species to this important wetland.

However, variation in environmental features might constrain foraging in complex ways and therefore impede the exploitation of critical resources. We tested the effect of water transparency on intra-population divergence in morphology of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) across seven lakes in central Sweden. Morphological divergence between near-shore littoral and open-water pelagic perch substantially increased with increasing water transparency. Reliance on littoral resources increased strongly with increasing water transparency in littoral populations, whereas littoral reliance was not affected by water transparency in pelagic populations. Despite the similar reliance on pelagic resources in pelagic populations along the water transparency gradient, the utilization of particular pelagic prey items differed with variation in water transparency in pelagic populations. Pelagic perch utilized cladocerans in lakes with high water transparency and copepods in lakes with low water transparency. We suggest that under impaired visual conditions low utilization of littoral resources by littoral perch and utilization of evasive copepods by pelagic perch may lead to changes in morphology. Our findings indicate that visual conditions can affect population divergence in predator populations through their effects on resource utilization.},

	abstract = {Background 
Very little is known regarding the persistence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses in aquatic environments in tropical countries, although environmental materials have been suggested to play a role as reservoirs and sources of transmission for H5N1 viruses.
Methodology/Principal Findings
The survival of HPAI H5N1 viruses in experimental aquatic biotopes (water, mud, aquatic flora and fauna) relevant to field conditions in Cambodia was investigated. Artificial aquatic biotopes, including simple ones containing only mud and water, and complex biotopes involving the presence of aquatic flora and fauna, were set up. They were experimentally contaminated with H5N1 virus. The persistence of HPAI H5N1 virus (local avian and human isolates) was determined by virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs and by real-time reverse-polymerase chain reaction. Persistence of infectious virus did not exceed 4 days, and was only identified in rain water. No infectious virus particles were detected in pond and lake water or mud even when high inoculum doses were used. However, viral RNA persisted up to 20 days in rain water and 7 days in pond or lake water. Viral RNA was also detected in mud samples, up to 14 days post-contamination in several cases. Infectious virus and viral RNA was detected in few cases in the aquatic fauna and flora, especially in bivalves and labyrinth fish, although these organisms seemed to be mostly passive carriers of the virus rather than host allowing virus replication.
Conclusions/Significance
Although several factors for the survival and persistence of HPAI viruses in the environment are still to be elucidated, and are particularly hard to control in laboratory conditions, our results, along with previous data, support the idea that environmental surveillance is of major relevance for avian influenza control programs.},

	abstract = {The role of intracontinental migration patterns of European eel (Anguilla anguilla) receives more and more recognition in both ecological studies of the European eel and possible management measures, but small-scale patterns proved to be challenging to study. We experimentally investigated the suitability of fatty acid trophic markers to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats. Eight groups of juvenile European eels were fed on eight different diets in a freshwater recirculation system at 20°C for 56 days. Three groups were fed on freshwater diets (Rutilus rutilus, Chironomidae larvae, and Gammarus pulex) and four groups were reared on diets of a marine origin (Clupea harengus, Crangon crangon, Mysis spec., and Euphausia superba) and one on commercial pellets used in eel aquaculture. Fatty acid composition (FAC) of diets differed significantly with habitat. FAC of eel muscle tissue seemed to be rather insensitive to fatty acids supplied with diet, but the general pattern of lower n3:n6 and EPA:ARA ratios in freshwater prey organisms could be traced in the respective eels. Multivariate statistics of the fatty acid composition of the eels resulted in two distinct groups representing freshwater and marine treatments. Results further indicate the capability of selectively restraining certain fatty acids in eel, as e.g. the n3:n6 ratio in all treatments was {\textless}4, regardless of dietary n3:n6. In future studies on wild eel, these measures can be used to elucidate the utilization of feeding habitats of individual European eel.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Biological invasions are one of the most pervasive environmental threats to native ecosystems worldwide. The spontaneous spread of saltcedar is a particular threat to biodiversity conservation in arid and semiarid environments. In Argentina, three species belonging to this genus have been recognized as invaders. The aim of the present study was to identify main dispersal vectors and pathways to refine risk analysis and increase our ability to predict new areas at risk of Tamarix establishment. We surveyed and categorized 223 populations, 39\% as invasive, 26\% as established, 21\% as contained and 14\% as detected in nature . Dispersion of saltcedar was found to be associated with watercourses and human-driven disturbances; in addition roads were found to be relevant for the introduction of propagules in new environments. Considering the potential impact of saltcedar invasion and that it is an easily wind-dispersed invasive, it is necessary to implement strategies to monitor dispersal pathways and take actions to eliminate invasion foci, particularly in vulnerable and high-conservation value areas.},

A three-tiered approach involving a field survey (Tier I), a density manipulation experiment (Tier II) and a microcosm experiment (Tier III) was applied to determine the effects of this invasive bivalve on biogeochemical cycling in the intertidal zone. At natural densities, bivalve distribution was best explained by sediment grain size. High densities of varnish clams did not significantly increase organic matter concentrations; although their ability to deposit feed and bioturbational activities may have prevented accumulations. High densities of varnish clams resulted in significantly higher concentrations of ammonium and percent silt. Nitrogen is a limiting nutrient with ammonium preferentially used by phytoplankton and microphytobenthos. These primary producers form the basis of all marine food webs; thus, changes in the concentration and flux of ammonium may impact ecosystem functioning of the intertidal area.

	abstract = {Wild pigs are a damaging invasive species with a long history in the United States. However, during the last 30 years wild pigs have drastically expanded their invasive range and are now present in 44 U.S. states. Though historic records provide insights regarding original introduction histories in areas where pigs are long-established, little is known regarding sources for new populations. To develop a better understanding of recent invasions, I utilized an array of molecular markers (mitochondrial DNA sequence, nuclear microsatellites, and nuclear single nucleotide polymorphisms) to evaluate both the evolutionary history of introduced pigs and gene flow between populations indicative of dispersal pathways.    Mitochondrial sequence provided a basal understanding of pig invasions (i.e., geographic origins and breed associations) through evaluation of U.S. pigs in context of published sequence from around the world. However, mitochondrial relationships must be considered cautiously, as introduction sources can be obscured due to shared ancestry between Eurasian wild boar and domestic pigs and the ubiquity of some haplotypes in national and global datasets.    With microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms, I identified multiple genetic groupings that corresponded to geographic distributions and known introduction histories. Through individual and population genetic distance analyses, I found that dispersal patterns and sources for invasions of wild pigs can be identified using molecular techniques. I also identified an isolation by distance relationship at the national level and in California, which suggests that range expansion can be tracked in terms of gene flow across the landscape. However, my results did not resolve whether the association of genetic distance with geographic distance has resulted from diminishing rates of gene flow under a natural dispersal scenario or from genetic drift associated with anthropogenic dispersal; evidence of both pathways for pig invasion was apparent in my dataset. Further, landscape genetic analyses suggested some role for natural dispersal in range expansion in California.    My findings here suggest that ongoing research in the area of wild pig genetics would be productive. Additional samples from throughout the United States will be necessary to further resolve population genetic relationships and the role of anthropogenic and natural dispersal in range expansion.},

Water-isolated viruses have rarely been genetically characterized and evaluation for persistence in water and infectivity in natural hosts has never been documented. In this study, we focused on two IA viruses (H3N8 and H4N6 subtypes) isolated from surface lake water in Minnesota, USA. We investigated the relative prevalence of the two virus subtypes in wild duck populations at the sampling site and their genetic relatedness to IA viruses isolated in wild waterbirds in North America. Viral persistence under different laboratory conditions (temperature and pH) and replication in experimentally infected Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) were also characterized. Both viruses were the most prevalent subtype one year following their isolation in lake water. The viruses persisted in water for an extended time period at constant temperature (several weeks) but infectivity rapidly reduced under multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Furthermore, the two isolates efficiently replicated in Mallards. The complete genome characterization supported that these isolates originated from genetic reassortments with other IA viruses circulating in wild duck populations during the year of sampling. Based on phylogenetic analyses, we couldn't identify genetically similar viruses in duck populations in the years following their isolation from lake water. Our study supports the role for water-borne transmission for IA viruses but also highlights that additional field and experimental studies are required to support inter-annual persistence in aquatic habitats.},

	abstract = {Although native enemies in an exotic species' new range are considered to affect its ability to invade, few studies have evaluated predation pressures from native enemies on exotic species in their new range. The exotic prey naiveté hypothesis (EPNH) states that exotic species may be at a disadvantage because of its naïveté towards native enemies and, therefore, may suffer higher predation pressures from the enemy than native prey species. Corollaries of this hypothesis include the native enemy preferring exotic species over native species and the diet of the enemy being influenced by the abundance of the exotic species. We comprehensively tested this hypothesis using introduced North American bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus, referred to as bullfrog), a native red-banded snake (Dinodon rufozonatum, the enemy) and four native anuran species in permanent still water bodies as a model system in Daishan, China. We investigated reciprocal recognition between snakes and anuran species (bullfrogs and three common native species) and the diet preference of the snakes for bullfrogs and the three species in laboratory experiments, and the diet preference and bullfrog density in the wild. Bullfrogs are naive to the snakes, but the native anurans are not. However, the snakes can identify bullfrogs as prey, and in fact, prefer bullfrogs over the native anurans in manipulative experiments with and without a control for body size and in the wild, indicating that bullfrogs are subjected to higher predation pressures from the snakes than the native species. The proportion of bullfrogs in the snakes' diet is positively correlated with the abundance of bullfrogs in the wild. Our results provide strong evidence for the EPNH. The results highlight the biological resistance of native enemies to naïve exotic species.},

Humans are the dominant species in most world ecosystems, and, thus, studying an introduced species' interactions with people is of utmost importance to understand its impacts, make predictions, and inform environmental policy. Here, we detail some remarkable findings of our ongoing research in this topic, including (1) the spatial distribution of introduced green iguanas with respect to people's activities and land uses, (2) the intracultural variation in attitudes and values regarding introduced iguanas and other introduced species in the study region, (3) local people's knowledge about iguana diets in the estuary, and (4) the interactions between green iguanas and the tourism industry in Puerto Rico.

	abstract = {There have been many well-publicized cases of invasive species of plants and animals, often introduced unintentionally but sometimes on purpose, causing widespread ecological havoc. Examples of such alien invasions include pernicious weeds such as Japanese knotweed, an introduced garden ornamental which can grow through concrete, the water hyacinth which has choked tropical waterways, and many introduced animals which have out-competed and displaced local fauna. This book addresses the broader context of invasive and exotic species, in terms of the perceived threats and environmental concerns which surround alien species and ecological invasions. As a result of unprecedented scales of environmental change, combined with rapid globalisation, the mixing of cultures and diversity, and fears over biosecurity and bioterrorism, the known impacts of particular invasions have been catastrophic. However, as several chapters show, reactions to some exotic species, and the justifications for interventions in certain situations, including biological control by introduced natural enemies, rest uncomfortably with social reactions to ethnic cleansing and persecution perpetrated across the globe. The role of democracy in deciding and determining environmental policy is another emerging issue. In an increasingly multicultural society this raises huge questions of ethics and choice. At the same time, in order to redress major ecological losses, the science of reintroduction of native species has also come to the fore, and is widely accepted by many in nature conservation. However, with questions of where and when, and with what species or even species analogues, reintroductions are acceptable, the topic is hotly debated. Again, it is shown that many decisions are based on values and perceptions rather than objective science. Including a wide range of case studies from around the world, his book raises critical issues to stimulate a much wider debate.},

	abstract = {Fish form an extremely diverse group of vertebrates. At a conservative estimate at least 40\% of the world's vertebrates are fish. On the one hand they are united by their adaptations to an aquatic environment and on the other they show a variety of adaptations to differing environmental conditions - often to extremes of temperature, salinity, oxygen level and water chemistry. They exhibit an array of behavioural and reproductive systems. Interesting in their own right, this suite of adaptive physiologies provides many model systems for both comparative vertebrate and human physiologists. 
This four volume encyclopedia covers the diversity of fish physiology in over 300 articles and provides entry level information for students and summary overviews for researchers alike.
Broadly organised into four themes, articles cover Functional, Thematic, and Phylogenetic Physiology, and Fish Genomics
Functional articles address the traditional aspects of fish physiology that are common to all areas of vertebrate physiology including: Reproduction, Respiration, Neural (Sensory, Central, Effector), Endocrinology, Renal, Cardiovascular, Acid-base Balance, Osmoregulation, Ionoregulation, Digestion, Metabolism, Locomotion, and so on.
Thematic Physiology articles are carefully selected and fewer in number. They provide a level of integration that goes beyond the coverage in the Functional Physiology topics and include discussions of Toxicology, Air-breathing, Migrations, Temperature, Endothermy, etc.
Phylogenetic Physiology articles bring together information that bridges the physiology of certain groupings of fishes where the knowledge base has a sufficient depth and breadth and include articles on Ancient Fishes, Tunas, Sharks, etc.
Genomics articles describe the underlying genetic component of fish physiology and high light their suitability and use as model organisms for the study of disease, stress and physiological adaptations and reactions to external conditions.

We propose using maximum entropy modeling to select dissimilar sampling sites to capture environmental variability at low cost, and demonstrate a specific application: sample site selection for the Central Plains domain (453,490 km2) of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). We relied on four environmental factors: mean annual temperature and precipitation, elevation, and vegetation type. A "sample site" was defined as a 20 km × 20 km area (equal to NEON's airborne observation platform [AOP] footprint), within which each 1 km2 cell was evaluated for each environmental factor. After each model run, the most environmentally dissimilar site was selected from all potential sample sites. The iterative selection of eight sites captured approximately 80\% of the environmental envelope of the domain, an improvement over stratified random sampling and simple random designs for sample site selection. This approach can be widely used for cost-efficient selection of survey and monitoring sites.},

	abstract = {The lionfish, Pterois volitans (Linnaeus) and Pterois miles (Bennett), invasion of the Western Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico has the potential to alter aquatic communities and represents a legitimate ecological concern. Several local removal programs have been initiated to control this invasion, but it is not known whether removal efforts can substantially reduce lionfish numbers to ameliorate these concerns. We used an age-structured population model to evaluate the potential efficacy of lionfish removal programs and identified critical data gaps for future studies. We used high and low estimates for uncertain parameters including: length at 50\% vulnerability to harvest (Lvul), instantaneous natural mortality (M), and the Goodyear compensation ratio (CR). The model predicted an annual exploitation rate between 35 and 65\% would be required to cause recruitment overfishing on lionfish populations for our baseline parameter estimates for M and CR (0.5 and 15). Lionfish quickly recovered from high removal rates, reaching 90\% of unfished biomass six years after a 50-year simulated removal program. Quantifying lionfish natural mortality and the size-selective vulnerability to harvest are the most important knowledge gaps for future research. We suggest complete eradication of lionfish through fishing is unlikely, and substantial reduction of adult abundance will require a long-term commitment and may be feasible only in small, localized areas where annual exploitation can be intense over multiple consecutive years.},

	abstract = {While many alien plant and animal species are purposefully introduced into new areas as ornamentals, livestock, crops, and even pets, these species can escape into other areas and threaten agricultural and native ecosystems causing economic and environmental harm, or harm to human health. Increasingly, scientists are using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to track and manage the invaders, mitigate the potential rate of spread and level of impact, and protect the native economy and ecosystem. Beginning with an introduction to the use of GIS technology to capture, store, analyze, manage, and present data, GIS Applications in Agriculture, Volume Three: Invasive Species examines five relevant categories of geographic information including dispersal and transport, prediction and forecasting, mapping of current infestations, maps for management and control tactics, and impact assessment and method of control. It address GIS for studying the population ecology of a new species, niche requirements for species success, and the monitoring and control of several different species including Australian examples of intentionally introduced invasive species, insects and other animals that may also vector a disease, and invasive weed management from prediction to management. Chapters cover maps and imageries available on various Web sites and provide step-by-step tutorials or case studies that allow manipulation of datasets featured on the accompanying CD-ROM to make maps, perform statistical analyses, and predict future problems. It offers hands-on experience with a variety of software programs that create interactive queries (user-created searches), analyze spatial information, edit data and maps, and present the results of these operations in several different formats. Some of the programs are freeware, others are not, but each can be used to integrate, edit, share, and display geographic information. Color figures are also available on the CD-ROM.},

	abstract = {There is increasing concern for the disruptive effects seen in aquatic species exposed to environmental contaminants. However, few studies have investigated the impact of such contaminants on the behavior of individuals living in exposed waters. Contaminant exposure can affect animal populations by disrupting behaviors including feeding, locomotion, and mating. In this study, we examined how living in an ecosystem polluted by combinations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated biphenyls, and heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, iron, lead, zinc) impacts contest behavior in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Fish collected from heavily contaminated and cleaner sites in Lake Ontario were subjected to a resource contest to determine the effect of these contaminants on aggression and the establishment of dominance hierarchies, which in turn influence access to food, shelter, and mating opportunities. Dominance establishment (a clear resource winner) was less obvious among fish from the contaminated site compared to the more stable hierarchies that formed between pairs of fish from the clean site. Pairs of fish from the contaminated site performed more assessment displays compared to fish from clean sites. These results suggest that the costs of living in an environment under exposure can shape behavioral repertoires. The altered conflict resolution strategies of contaminated fish may reflect impaired cognitive function, sensory perception, and/or higher metabolic load associated with aggression. This study provides support for the utilization of quantifiable behavioral differences as ecologically relevant measures of contaminant exposure.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {We assessed the blue mussel Mytilus edulis fishery management scheme introduced in 1994 in the Danish Wadden Sea that regulate fishing vessels, fishery quota, set-aside for mussel-eating birds and established zones closed to mussel fishery. The results showed (i) a reduction in the blue mussel biomass and mussel bed areas in zones closed to fishery, (ii) decrease in eiders Somateria mollissima numbers and increase or stable numbers for oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and herring gull Larus argentatus and (iii) that energy estimations based on ecological food requirements for the mussel-eating birds should be at least three times larger, than the amount set-aside in the mussel management scheme. It is concluded that the mussel management scheme had been unable to stabilize or increase the blue mussel stocks and to secure stable or increasing numbers for all target bird species. Thus, it is recommended to revise the present blue mussel management scheme in the Danish Wadden Sea, to continue and improve mussel stock and bird surveys, and to consider novel studies of the mussel-eating birds' energetics for improved set-aside estimates and future assessments.

	abstract = {The Balkans is a biogeographically highly diverse region and a worldwide hotspot of endemic freshwater diversity. A substantial part of this diversity is attributed to well recognized and potential ancient lakes in its southwestern part. However, despite considerable research efforts, faunal relationships among those lakes are not well understood. Therefore, genetic information from native representatives of the mussel genus Dreissena is here used to test the biogeographical zonation of the southwestern Balkans, to relate demographic changes to environmental changes, to assess the degree of eco-insularity, to reconstruct their evolutionary history, and to explore the potential of native taxa for becoming invasive.              Phylogeographical and population genetic analyses indicate that most studied populations belong to two native species: D. presbensis (including the distinct genetic subgroup from Lake Ohrid, "D. stankovici") and D. blanci. In addition, the first confirmed record of invasive D. polymorpha in the southwestern Balkan is presented.              The distribution of native Dreissena spp. generally coincides with the biogeographical zonations previously suggested based on fish data. However, there is disagreement on the assignment of the ancient lakes in the area to respective biogeographical regions. The data for Lake Ohrid are not conclusive. A closer biogeographical connection to lakes of the Vardar region and possibly the northern Ionian region is, however, suggested for Lake Prespa.              The reconstruction of the evolutionary history of Dreissena spp. suggests that populations underwent demographic and spatial expansions in the recent past. Expansions started around 320 000-300 000 years ago in "D. stankovici", 160 000-140 000 years ago in D. blanci, and 110 000-70 000 years ago in D. presbensis. These time frames are discussed within the context of available paleogeological data for lakes Ohrid and Prespa. It is suggested that regional environmental changes may have had pronounced effects on the population histories of native Dreissena spp., though the high buffer capacity of Lake Ohrid may have lessened these effects in "D. stankovici". In addition, local events influencing individual lakes had very likely considerable effects on the demographic histories of Dreissena spp. as well. The observed patterns of immigration and emigration in and out of ancient lakes may suggest that limited gene flow enabled the survival of few isolated subpopulations and that later on eco-insularity (selective advantages of locally adopted groups) may have prevented excessive hybridization and sympatry of closely related taxa.              As for the potential invasiveness of native Dreissena spp., the inferred spatial expansions are not human-mediated and all taxa still appear to be restricted to their native ranges. A concern, however, is that today D. presbensis and D. blanci also occur in artificial water bodies, and that invasive D. polymorpha has reached the area.},

	doi = {10.3390/toxins2102359},
	abstract = {Microorganisms are ubiquitous in all habitats and are recognized by their metabolic versatility and ability to produce many bioactive compounds, including toxins. Some of the most common toxins present in water are produced by several cyanobacterial species. As a result, their blooms create major threats to animal and human health, tourism, recreation and aquaculture. Quite a few cyanobacterial toxins have been described, including hepatotoxins, neurotoxins, cytotoxins and dermatotoxins. These toxins are secondary metabolites, presenting a vast diversity of structures and variants. Most of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites are peptides or have peptidic substructures and are assumed to be synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (NRPS), involving peptide synthetases, or NRPS/PKS, involving peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases hybrid pathways. Besides cyanobacteria, other bacteria associated with aquatic environments are recognized as significant toxin producers, representing important issues in food safety, public health, and human and animal well being. Vibrio species are one of the most representative groups of aquatic toxin producers, commonly associated with seafood-born infections. Some enterotoxins and hemolysins have been identified as fundamental for V. cholerae and V. vulnificus pathogenesis, but there is evidence for the existence of other potential toxins. Campylobacter spp. and Escherichia coli are also water contaminants and are able to produce important toxins after infecting their hosts. Other bacteria associated with aquatic environments are emerging as toxin producers, namely Legionella pneumophila and Aeromonas hydrophila, described as responsible for the synthesis of several exotoxins, enterotoxins and cytotoxins. Furthermore, several Clostridium species can produce potent neurotoxins. Although not considered aquatic microorganisms, they are ubiquitous in the environment and can easily contaminate drinking and irrigation water. Clostridium members are also spore-forming bacteria and can persist in hostile environmental conditions for long periods of time, contributing to their hazard grade. Similarly, Pseudomonas species are widespread in the environment. Since P. aeruginosa is an emergent opportunistic pathogen, its toxins may represent new hazards for humans and animals. This review presents an overview of the diversity of toxins produced by prokaryotic microorganisms associated with aquatic habitats and their impact on environment, life and health of humans and other animals. Moreover, important issues like the availability of these toxins in the environment, contamination sources and pathways, genes involved in their biosynthesis and molecular mechanisms of some representative toxins are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The brackish Baltic Sea hosts species of various origins and environmental tolerances. These immigrated to the sea 10,000 to 15,000 years ago or have been introduced to the area over the relatively recent history of the system. The Baltic Sea has only one known endemic species. While information on some abiotic parameters extends back as long as five centuries and first quantitative snapshot data on biota (on exploited fish populations) originate generally from the same time, international coordination of research began in the early twentieth century. Continuous, annual Baltic Sea-wide long-term datasets on several organism groups (plankton, benthos, fish) are generally available since the mid-1950s. Based on a variety of available data sources (published papers, reports, grey literature, unpublished data), the Baltic Sea, incl. Kattegat, hosts altogether at least 6,065 species, including at least 1,700 phytoplankton, 442 phytobenthos, at least 1,199 zooplankton, at least 569 meiozoobenthos, 1,476 macrozoobenthos, at least 380 vertebrate parasites, about 200 fish, 3 seal, and 83 bird species. In general, but not in all organism groups, high sub-regional total species richness is associated with elevated salinity. Although in comparison with fully marine areas the Baltic Sea supports fewer species, several facets of the system's diversity remain underexplored to this day, such as micro-organisms, foraminiferans, meiobenthos and parasites. In the future, climate change and its interactions with multiple anthropogenic forcings are likely to have major impacts on the Baltic biodiversity.},

Invasive species have altered the Great lakes ecosystem and continue to do so with tragic consequences. The Asian Carp is now only six miles from Lake Michigan.  See Great Lakes United website, www.glu.org for more information. Electric barriers and poison have not stopped this huge predator so far, and scientists believe that the \$4.5 billion dollar fishing industry would be devastated if the carp infiltrate the Great Lakes. This is not the first time that that the Great Lakes have been threatened. The  rainbow trout, white perch, sea lamprey, pacific salmon smelt, zebra and quagga mussels, round goby, alewife, Chinook salmon,  brown trout spiny water flea  are just a few of the 180 invasive species that were either intentionally brought to the lakes or came by other means such as by ship ballast water, Add climate change, pollutants, a lack of effective governance, poor sewage infrastructure and water quality plus ineffective public participation, and this glacial treasure can easily become a watery wasteland.},

	abstract = {Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are a group of contaminants of emerging concern that are introduced into aquatic environments by non-point and point sources. This study assessed seasonal/regional trends of targeted PPCPs detected in samples from two local wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and surface water from the Charleston Harbor over twelve months. After modifying EPA Method 1694 to include hormones, analysis using HPLC/MS/MS revealed that of the 19 target compounds examined, 11 were quantified above method reporting limits in wastewater influent, 9 in effluent, and 7 in surface water samples. Concentrations were reduced by {\textgreater} 90\% for most chemicals in effluent compared to influent, though concentrations of some PPCPs in effluent were higher than those in influent. Differences in effluent concentrations and estimated removal between WWTPs are believed to be related to variation in general operating parameters and/or the anoxic basin employed by one of the facilities. Laboratory experiments also examined the effects of salinity on PPCP recovery/degradation and PPCP effects on oxygen uptake in Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica ) gill tissue. Results indicate that there may be little to no risk for acute effects on non-target organisms, though further testing of sublethal exposures and/or mixtures is warranted. Overall, future monitoring of PPCPs may aid in minimizing potential negative impacts of increasing urban/industrial development in coastal regions.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien species are a major and growing threat to biodiversity worldwide. The transport of organisms through increased levels of trade and tourism is leading to the widespread breaching of natural biogeographic barriers at unprecedented rates. Consequences can be severe, especially in naturally isolated ecosystems. Invasive alien species can cause the extinction of vulnerable endemic species, alter the structure and composition of communities, disruptsuccessional pathways, and lead to the loss of ecosystem services. Global climate change may further exacerbate the spread of alien species, as climatic zones shift and potential ranges alter.The effective management of invasive alien species is clearly a priority for biological conservation worldwide. This book first provides strategies for managing such species at successive invasion stages, from prevention at the border to control of major infestations. It then describes the general tools and approaches that are recommended for successful management of particular groups of invasive organisms in a range of environments. In each case, the ecological basis and practical requirementsof invasive alien species management are addressed.This integration of proven techniques and policies will be useful to a wide readership of students, academics, conservation practitioners, invasive species managers, legislators, and to the broader community concerned with biological conservation.},

	abstract = {What's the common thread? It's all about invasive alien species. These are plants and animals that end up in an environment where they weren't previously found - usually with help from humans - typically causing harm to the native species and ecosystems they interact with. 


Globalization and human movement have increased the spread of invasive species worldwide. As with plants and animals introduced by European settlers and explorers, today's invasive plants and animals are sometimes deliberately introduced - often for food or decorative purposes - and are sometimes accidentally introduced, as with zebra mussels and invasive plants spread when ships empty their ballast in Canadian waters.


Once an introduced species has established itself, it is extremely difficult to eradicate. Targeted control is commonly used where species have already been introduced. This can range from removing the alien species to using pesticides or herbicides to introducing native predator species.},

All species are subject to control by Swedish public authorities, and estimates for most AIS include either damage cost or actual control cost. The results indicate a total annual cost between approximately 1620 and 5080 million SEK, which correspond to SEK 175 and SEK 565 per capita in Sweden. The estimates are well within the range of similar calculations for other countries, but differ with respect to the composition of costs of different AIS. Whereas costs for the agricultural and forestry sectors dominate in most other studies, the costs of AIS in Sweden are more equally divided among different categories. The results also Indicate that the highest costs are attributable to unintentionally introduced AIS and that the most reliable cost estimates are related to human and animal health.

	abstract = {Coastal sediments in sheltered temperate locations are strongly modified by ecosystem engineering species such as marsh plants, seagrass, and algae as well as by epibenthic and endobenthic invertebrates. These ecosystem engineers are shaping the coastal sea and landscape, control particulate and dissolved material fluxes between the land and sea, and between the benthos and the passing water or air. Above all, habitat engineering exerts facilitating and inhibiting effects on biodiversity. Despite a strongly growing interest in the functional role of ecosystem engineering over the recent years, compared to food web analyses, the conceptual understanding of engineering-mediated species interactions is still in its infancy. In the present paper, we provide a concise overview on current insights and propose two hypotheses on the general mechanisms by which ecosystem engineering may affect biodiversity in coastal sediments. We hypothesise that autogenic and allogenic ecosystem engineers have inverse effects on epibenthic and endobenthic biodiversity in coastal sediments. The primarily autogenic structures of the epibenthos achieve high diversity at the expense of endobenthos, whilst allogenic sediment reworking by infauna may facilitate other infauna and inhibits epibenthos. On a larger scale, these antagonistic processes generate patchiness and habitat diversity. Due to such interaction, anthropogenic influences can strongly modify the engineering community by removing autogenic ecosystem engineers through coastal engineering or bottom trawling. Another source of anthropogenic influences comes from introducing invasive engineers, from which the impact is often hard to predict. We hypothesise that the local biodiversity effects of invasive ecosystem engineers will depend on the engineering strength of the invasive species, with engineering strength defined as the number of habitats it can invade and the extent of modification. At a larger scale of an entire shore, biodiversity need not be decreased by invasive engineers and may even increase. On a global scale, invasive engineers may cause shore biota to converge, especially visually due to the presence of epibenthic structures.},

	abstract = {Geographic variation in coastal marine upwelling creates a complex seascape of environmental conditions that underlie biogeographic patterns of demographic rates, species distributions, and the structure of marine assemblages. Quantitative descriptions of spatial and temporal variation in assemblages can identify potential processes that regulate structure and dynamics of species at different scales. Understanding the spatial patterns of species demography and structure of assemblages across the seascape also informs more applied endeavors such as fisheries management, conservation of species diversity and species response to global change. This dissertation addresses patterns of community structure and demographic variation of populations in temperate kelp forest ecosystems and explores mechanisms that may generate these patterns.    In Chapter 1, I present one of the first comprehensive studies of kelp forest community structure across variable upwelling conditions. Variation in the strength and frequency of upwelling can influence coastal marine assemblages through bottom-up effects of temperature, nutrients, and larval delivery. However, high variability in community structure may exist at local scales due to species interactions, habitat structure, and other local-scale processes. I ask whether benthic species vary across regional scales (10s-100s km), reflecting variation in upwelling, or at local-scales (1-10s km), signaling possible effects of local processes. From replicate detailed surveys of kelp forest flora and fauna, I explicitly test the assumption that subtidal benthic communities exhibit variation in the abundance of dominant benthic functional groups associated with regional-scale variation in upwelling. I demonstrate that upwelling processes regulate biomass of functional groups in kelp forest assemblages, but that local-scale patterns are important for some species, highlighting the need to look at both aggregate and compositional aspects of natural assemblages.    In Chapters 2 and 3, I compare life history traits (i.e. growth, fecundity, and survival) among populations of Megastraea undosa, a benthic turbinid snail, across different upwelling regimes. Geographic variation in life history traits underlies patterns of population persistence, biogeography, evolutionary biology, and predicted response to global change and resource management; but, geographic variation in life history traits has received little attention, particularly in marine conservation and management.    Variation in coastal upwelling dynamics leads to differences in both temperature and food availability, two factors that can affect energy available for individual maintenance, reproduction and growth. However, temperature and food availability are negatively correlated in coastal marine systems dominated by upwelling and may lead to reduced energy available for multiple life history traits. In Chapter 2, I examine whether geographic variation in upwelling leads to trade-offs between growth and reproduction in  Megastraea undosa, and whether geographic differences in trade-offs lead to differences in average individual fitness between populations. Using mark-recapture and histology techniques, I demonstrate that geographic variation in trade-offs between growth and reproduction exists and is related to variation in upwelling. In cold, nutrient-rich waters, higher growth rates lead to lower reproductive allocation, while in regions of less persistent upwelling, the opposite occurs. However, these two different life history strategies lead to similar lifetime cumulative reproductive output between regions. These results highlight the importance of considering multiple life history traits rather than single traits when examining geographic variation in population dynamics. Furthermore, I show that applying similar fisheries regulations across populations with varying demography may result in local depletion of populations.    In Chapter 3, I examine whether a relationship between seawater temperature and individual growth of M. undosa exists, and if this relationship varies with regional variation in upwelling conditions. I reconstruct time series of water temperature and growth of M. undosa using isotopes and growth marks in calcium carbonate opercula. Results indicate that M. undosa growth is correlated with water temperature, but the direction of the correlation depends on upwelling region. The mechanisms causing spatial variation in these relationships are likely the direct effects of temperature on metabolism coupled with the indirect responses of the dominant macroalgae to upwelling intensity and energy allocation to other vital rates.},

	abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems worldwide are being severely altered or destroyed at a rate greater than they are being restored (NRC,  1992). According to the 1994 National Water Quality Inventory of 617,806 miles of rivers and streams, only 56 percent fully supported multiple uses, including drinking water supply, fish and wildlife habitat, recreation, and agriculture, as well as flood protection and erosion control ( FISRWG, 2001). In 2005, the National River Restoration Science Synthesis (NRRSS) working group released the results of a multi-year study of the motivations and subsequent performance of completed river restoration projects within the United States. Through the development of a comprehensive database, the study found that although over \$1 billion is spent on restoration projects each year, it was found that more than half the projects failed to meet the intended goals and design criteria (Kondolf and Downs, 2004).    River restoration is not a mature science (Brookes and Shields,  1996) and there exists significant gaps in scientific knowledge of river restoration, as well as undetermined biases and errors in the current empirical design formulations and numerical models, resulting in 'uncertainties' that dramatically impact the outcomes of these projects.    River restoration projects fail through the omission of essential parameters in the development and configuration of the project. In order to achieve reliable river restoration projects it is essential that the problem to be remedied is completely and comprehensively defined; that project-related uncertainties (i.e. physical, temporal, financial) be acknowledged, estimated, and accounted for; and interactive management approaches (such as adaptive management) be configured and employed to manage those parameters identified as having significant influence on the project and high magnitudes of uncertainty.   River restoration is evaluated from a life-cycle perspective. Additionally, reliability is a central theme of the research. By including reliability into river restoration, it becomes possible to directly incorporate project performance as well as the plethora of uncertainties that plague many river restoration efforts from achieving their intended outcomes.   Through literature reviews, this research synthesizes the current interdisciplinary river restoration body of knowledge (classified by NRRSS goal categories) and created a river restoration 'checklist' with associated resources (planning guides, design manuals, computer software programs, and GIS data) for planning and design to correlate minimum project requirements with intended restoration goals. Case studies are presented for validation and the case studies also present management strategies for restoration uncertainties and adaptive management.},

	abstract = {Le but de cette étude était de déterminer si les effluents urbains peuvent perturber l'immunité et la reproduction d'une espèce sentinelle, la moule d'eau douce Elliptio complanata. Trois échelles d'évaluations ont permis de tester cette hypothèse au niveau cellulaire et hormonal, dans des conditions de laboratoire et de terrain.Tout d'abord, une expérience en aquarium a consisté en l'exposition de moules à différentes concentrations d'effluents urbains de la ville de laval (Québec) issus de traitements physico-chimique (effluent F) ou par biofiltration (effluent A), et caractérisés chimiquement de façon exhaustive. les réponses obtenues, apparues généralement à partir d'une concentration de 10\%, ont confirmé la sensibilité des biomarqueurs immunologiques chez les bivalves. les animaux ont subit une diminution de leurs comptes d'hémocytes, accompagnée d'une augmentation de la phagocytose et une diminution de la capacité cytotoxique des cellules immunitaires. la sécrétion d'oxyde nitrique fut augmentée de façon proportionnelle à la phagocytose, suggérant que cette molécule joue un rôle important dans la lutte antibactérienne chez les bivalves d'eau douce. Aucune perturbation des mécanismes endocriniens,mesurés par la sécrétion de vitellogénine (VTG) dans la gonade, n'a été mesurée.Dans une deuxième expérience, les moules ont été exposées aux mêmes effluents F et A dans le cours d'eau récepteur, la rivière des Mille-Îles, grâce à la mise en place de cages d'exposition en aval et en amont des rejets par les stations d'épuration. les résultats ont montrés que les effluents urbains peuvent provoquer la mort des mollusques (60\% en aval des deux rejets) après un mois d'exposition. Cependant, les effets immunologiques ont été très différents selon la station. l'effluent F, rejeté en amont de la rivière, a provoqué une immunostimulation induite par les fortes charges bactériennes. l'effluent A a cependant inhibé les fonctions cellulaires et la sécrétion de lysozymes, indiquant probablement une contamination chimique plus toxique ainsi qu'une accumulation des polluants le long de la rivière. De plus, des liens entre activité phagocytaire et production de VTG chez les moules ont été mis en évidence de manière statistique, suggérant une implication de cette protéine dans les processus immunitaires, et donc des liens entre l'immunité et le statut hormonal.Afin de tester ces hypothèses au niveau cellulaire, des hémocytes ont été exposés in vitro à la VTG isolée de gonade de moule ainsi qu'à l'estradiol. Les résultats montrent que la que la VTG peut stimuler faiblement la phagocytose. De même, l'estradiol peut augmenter cette activité immunitaire, ce qui suggère la présence de récepteurs aux stéroïdes sexuels sur les hémocytes.Ces expériences ont donc contribué à une meilleure connaissance des mécanismes de toxicité des rejets urbains sur les moules d'eau douce, qui sont des espèces largement utilisées en écotoxicologie et qui jouent un rôle majeur dans le fonctionnement des écosystèmes lacustres. Les mécanismes cellulaires de ces perturbations devront être précisés, ainsi que le rôle des différents contaminants contenus dans ces effluents.Alternate abstract:The aim of this study was to determine whether urban effluents can disrupt the immunity and reproduction of a sentinel species, the freshwater mussel Elliptio complanata. Three rating scales were used to test this hypothesis at the cellular and hormonal level, under laboratory and field conditions.First, an aquarium experiment consisted of exposing mussels to different concentrations of urban effluents from the city of Laval (Quebec) resulting from physico-chemical treatments (effluent F) or by biofiltration (effluent A), and exhaustively chemically characterized. the responses obtained, generally appearing from a concentration of 10\%, confirmed the sensitivity of immunological biomarkers in bivalves. the animals experienced a decrease in their hemocyte counts, accompanied by an increase in phagocytosis and a decrease in the cytotoxic capacity of immune cells. nitric oxide secretion was increased proportionally to phagocytosis, suggesting that this molecule plays an important role in antibacterial control in freshwater bivalves. No disruption of endocrine mechanisms, measured by vitellogenin (VTG) secretion in the gonad, was measured.In a second experiment, the mussels were exposed to the same F and A effluents in the receiving watercourse, the Rivière des Mille-Îles, thanks to the installation of exposure cages downstream and upstream of the discharges by treatment plants. the results showed that urban effluents can cause the death of molluscs (60\% downstream of the two discharges) after one month of exposure. However, the immunological effects were very different depending on the station. effluent F, discharged upstream of the river, caused immunostimulation induced by high bacterial loads. Effluent A, however, inhibited cellular functions and lysozyme secretion, probably indicating more toxic chemical contamination as well as an accumulation of pollutants along the river. In addition, links between phagocytic activity and VTG production in mussels have been statistically demonstrated, suggesting an involvement of this protein in immune processes, and therefore links between immunity and hormonal status.In order to test these hypotheses at the cellular level, hemocytes were exposed in vitro to VTG isolated from mussel gonad as well as to estradiol. The results show that VTG can weakly stimulate phagocytosis. Similarly, estradiol may increase this immune activity, suggesting the presence of sex steroid receptors on haemocytes.These experiments have therefore contributed to a better understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity of urban discharges on freshwater mussels, which are species widely used in ecotoxicology and which play a major role in the functioning of lake ecosystems. The cellular mechanisms of these disturbances will have to be specified, as well as the role of the various contaminants contained in these effluents.},

In so doing, they repeatedly mischaracterize my positions in order to depict, incorrectly, invasion biology as monolithic and me as a representative of one extreme of a false dichotomy about management of introduced species. In addition, they introduce an issue irrelevant in this case (extinctions) and cite incorrect data. Proposing to manage people, manatees, introduced plants, and cyanobacteria in Kings Bay by participative adaptive management, they ignore the fact that living organisms can both disperse autonomously and hitchhike. Finally, they present few details on any aspect of their management proposal and do not address the myriad problems that have beset previous attempts at scientific adaptive management, especially at large scales. Until such a management approach is fleshed out and implemented, it is impossible to assess its validity for Kings Bay, and it is very premature to suggest it as a general model for dealing with invasive species disputes.

He was chairman and advisor of services of the European Commission and several Dutch governmental departments. He published hundreds of scientific publications, mainly devoted to ecology and environmental sciences, in particular to estuarine and river ecology and management. After his retirement in 2003 he continued his writing activities, together with his editorial and advisory work.},

	abstract = {Management of lakes requires an understanding of both ecological and social concepts. As lakeshores continue to be developed, human lake communities need to be aware of the ecological relationships as well as the interested stakeholders that may play a role as management decisions are made. The focus of this study was to describe the role of communication as a social network of lake management stakeholders in Minnesota using a case study method. The objectives were to describe and characterize stakeholders associated with management of three lakes in west-central Minnesota and to assess the relative activities and roles of government and non-government organizations. Ties among stakeholders were demonstrated using social network analysis. Density, measures of centrality, and frequency were estimated to identify central actors. Density was higher for information exchange than for funding or materials exchange. Central actors identified across exchange networks generally included county organizations, state organizations, federal agencies, watershed districts, soil and water conservation districts, and coalitions of lake associations. Lake associations and lake improvement districts were not as centrally located as some of the other stakeholders. The incorporation of methods from several disciplines may assist lake communities and land managers with lake management decisions. Throughout the decades, increasing pressures on these scarce resources has led to an increase in the number of rules and regulations placed on lakeshore owners. As agencies with differing objectives and missions continue to implement regulations due to changing needs and as special interest groups lobby for or against standards, lake communities need to be able to recognize the role they have in the management decision-making process. By recognizing the roles and positions of organizations within the network, conflict, collaboration, and changes in management needs, a better decision-making process can be achieved in lake management.},

The results indicated that a majority of the studies recognize the need for addressing the links between economic and ecological systems and accounting for the uncertainty associated with predicting damages from invasive species. A common result is that strategies for prevention, control and damage reduction are complementary, and neglect of any of them may lead to unnecessary large social costs. Furthermore, unless economy-wide adjustments are accounted for when designing tariffs on imports, counteractive results may occur where the risk of invasive species damage increases. However, due to insufficient availability of data on the environmental impacts of alien invasive species, there is a lack of empirical applications.},

The dualistic stalemate in which these debates have resulted-with only two extreme positions, nativism on the one hand and cosmopolitanism on the other-is at least partly connected to the dominance of loaded political metaphors. To break up this dichotomy to create space for fruitful debate, we will explore various metaphorical frames of ecological thinking and their implications for invasion biology. We will deconstruct the nativism-cosmopolitanism dichotomy by identifying various management practices, in each of which the native species issue is shaped differently. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {The effects of global change and globalization of trade on the biosphere spur an increase in bioinvasions and their subsequent impact on ecosystems. Continental invading bivalves are important because of their impact on artificially-constructed structures. Limnoperna fortunei was first found in the Neotropical region in 1991. Since then it has dispersed upstream in the Plata and Guaíba basins at a rate of 240 km y{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}. This species causes macrofouling in a manner similar to that caused by Dreissena polymorpha. This paper describes the biology of L. fortunei larvae from a hydroelectric power plant in South America. We suggest the importance of knowing the biology of the invading species and the need to consider the settlement patterns and densities of larvae in each of the sectors of the facility in order to achieve a sustainable prevention/control of macrofouling. This study acquires a global significance under the assumption that L. fortunei will eventually invade North America and Europe. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Unlike most ecological textbooks, which use examples taken almost exclusively from terrestrial systems, this book integrates the fields of limnology and ecology by presenting empirical data drawn entirely from freshwater ecosystems in order to advance ecological theories (limnoecology). This second edition builds upon the strengths of the first with the structure of the book following the same hierarchical concept of ecology, from habitat properties, individuals, populations, coupled populations and communities to ecosystems. However, it has been thoroughly revised throughout to incorporate findings from new technologies and methods (notably the rapid development of molecular genetic methods and stable isotope techniques) that have allowed a rapid and ongoing development of the field. There is a new emphasis on food webs, species diversity and ecosystem functioning, climate change, and conservation management. Key ecological questions are examined in the light of the latest experimental evidence.; Throughout the text evolutionary theory is applied to an understanding of freshwater ecosystems, thereby filling a niche between traditional limnology and evolutionary ecology.},

The effect of low temperature, salinity, and bacterial amendments were tested in laboratory-scale set-ups, whereas 600-L mesocosms filled with Baltic Sea water were used for testing the effects of diesel oil and rapid removal of the oil on microorganisms, phytoplankton, and mussels. Cotton grass proved to be an excellent sorbent for diesel oil from the water surface at a low temperature. Inoculation with diesel-enriched microorganisms enhanced degradation of oil significantly in laboratory-scale experiments. In mesocosm experiments, the addition of diesel oil (0.66 mg L{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}, 0.533 L m{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}) to the basins resulted in higher microbial density than in all other basins, including inoculated ones, suggesting that the Baltic Sea contains indigenous hydrocarbon degraders. The removal of oil with cotton grass significantly improved the survival of mussels in the mesocosm tests: 100\% mortality in diesel basins versus 0\% mortality in basins with cotton grass, respectively. However, the surviving mussels suffered from histopathological changes such as inflammatory responses, degenerations, and cell death. The observed rescuing effect was observable even when the cotton grass-bound oil was left in the water. The results underline the importance of rapid action in limiting damage caused by oil spills.

	abstract = {Samples of Unio pictorum mancus collected monthly from spring 2003 to summer 2004 in the meso-oligotrophic Lake Maggiore and the eutrophic Lake Candia were compared to evaluate the influence of lake trophic conditions on mussel populations. Shell form, maximum age (8 years) and percentage of organic matter in the shell and soft tissues were similar in both lakes. However, comparisons between same size classes revealed that mussels from Lake Maggiore were generally older, their shells heavier and their soft tissues lighter than those from Lake Candia. Recruitment occurred in both populations in June-July. The frequency distributions of adult mussels ({\textgreater}30 mm) and their soft tissues and shell biomasses in all size classes (range = 2 mm) were normal, but the curves of the mussels from Lake Candia were flat in comparison to those of mussels from Lake Maggiore. The median body size of Lake Maggiore mussels was 58 mm, while that of the Lake Candia population was 72 mm. During the study period the population density of each lake was fairly constant, whereas the population structure, and consequently the biomass, showed seasonal variations. The greatest differences were found between population density and shell and tissue biomass of the two populations, which were respectively 46.86 ind. m-2; 408 g d.w. m-2 and 38.67 g d.w. m-2 in Lake Maggiore, and 6.93 ind. m-2; 92.29 g d.w. m-2 and 14.04 g d.w. m-2 in Lake Candia. These values testify to the phenotypical plasticity of Unio pictorum mancus in relation to environmental characteristics, without excluding a possible genetic influence as a result of geographical isolation and the respective selection mechanisms. The influence exerted by the lake trophic level and by the physical environment on some population characteristics is discussed.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic alterations to the global nitrogen (N) cycle have doubled reactive N flux into the biosphere and altered aquatic ecosystem function. Streams modify N loads carried to coastal ecosystems by converting N to organic forms or removing it as gaseous N. Understanding how streams transform N can offer insight to ecologists and land managers about how stream ecosystems function under elevated N loads. I researched how anthropogenic and landscape factors affect N transformations by studying streams in two distinct biomes and at multiple spatial scales.   At the landscape scale, I studied N concentrations in streams draining the Teton Range (Wyoming, USA), a sub-alpine and alpine ecosystem with variable lithology. Streams draining crystalline geology had higher N compared to streams draining carbonate geology, which had more vegetation, suggesting that lithology mediated patterns in vegetation and terrestrial N retention. At the reach scale, I studied how land use influenced N uptake and transformation in Midwestern streams (Michigan, USA) and found that dissimilatory N transformation rates (i.e., nitrification and denitrification) within streams were not affected by riparian zones, which are commonly used to mitigate water quality degradation. Dissimilatory N transformation rates were always {\textless} 10\% of whole-stream N uptake and nitrification rates balanced denitrification rates, implying that denitrification did not represent net N loss from the water column. At the substratum scale, sediment organic carbon content correlated with denitrification, but only when nitrate concentration exceeded a threshold. Finally, I returned to the Tetons and found that grazing activity by invasive snails can increase periphyton N fixation rates in a stream with low N concentrations.   A synthesis of my findings from high N streams in the Midwest suggests that land-use practices have increased temporary N removal at the expense of permanent N removal. In the low N streams of the Tetons, observations from different spatial scales suggest that landscape factors that lower stream N concentrations and high rates of grazing together can influence the importance of N fixation in streams. My dissertation highlights multiple constraints on N processing in streams and emphasizes that basic ecological research can yield important results for management agencies.},

POPs are introduced into Burrard Inlet by a number of sources including both,  point sources (e.g., industrial and municipal effluent discharges) and non-point sources such as storm water runoff. Once introduced to the inlet, contaminants are subject to physical, chemical and biological processes that lead to dispersion and accumulation in different matrices of the marine environment.    The main purpose of the model is to provide a comprehensive ecosystem-level assessment of the fate of contaminants in Burrard Inlet to characterize the relationship between concentrations of POPs in sediments and organisms of the Burrard Inlet food-web. The results provided significant evidence of bioaccumulation of a PCB mixture in some key biological receptors in the food web and also include recommendations for the development of sediment target levels and loading for PCBs in support management decisions regarding POPs in Burrard Inlet.

	abstract = {Les activités industrielles, agricoles ou urbaines de l'homme exercent une pression chimique sur l'environnement marin. Lors d'accidents, mais le plus souvent lors de contaminations chroniques des effluents anthropiques, cette pression peut engendrer des effets toxiques de l'échelle moléculaire à l'échelle écosystémique perturbant le fonctionnement de l'écosystème marin côtier. Le risque environnemental de ces substances chimiques est caractérisé à l'aide de biomarqueurs. Ces outils permettent la détection de ces polluants ou de leurs effets toxiques, la prédiction de ces effets sur les écosystèmes et la surveillance de leur évolution. Depuis une vingtaine d'années les biomarqueurs du système immunitaire sont utilisés pour diagnostiquer des effets immunotoxiques de nombreux groupes de polluants, sur plusieurs espèces sentinelles des écosystèmes terrestres et aquatiques, notamment chez les bivalves. Néanmoins, plusieurs facteurs endogènes et environnementaux peuvent moduler le fonctionnement du système immunitaire d'un individu et ainsi confondre le signal immunotoxique du polluant. Dans le cadre d'une collaboration franco-canadienne entre deux réseaux de recherche en écotoxicologie, le Réseau de recherche en écotoxicologie du Saint Laurent (RRESL) et le groupement de recherche « interactions moléculaires et physiologiques des contaminants du milieu marin (GDR IMOPHYS), ce travail de doctorat s'est attaché à étudier l'impact de certains facteurs confondants, en vue de valider l'utilisation de l'outil immunotoxicologique dans l'évaluation du risque environnemental en milieu marin.La stratégie de l'étude s'est orientée selon trois axes, en utilisant deux espèces modèles communes dans l'évaluation environnementale de 1'écosystème marin, de par leurs caractéristiques écologiques et leur importance économique, l'huître creuse, Crassostrea gigas, et la moule bleue, Mytilus edulis. Un premier axe méthodologique s'est attaché à comparer différentes techniques et méthodes d'analyses des paramètres des cellules de la défense immunitaire chez les bivalves, les hémocytes, à développer un nouveau protocole d'exposition individuelle et à mettre au point un indice global de la réponse immunotoxique. Un second axe, écophysiologique, a cherché à étudier l'impact des facteurs endogènes et saisonniers sur le fonctionnement individuel du système immunitaire chez ces deux espèces de bivalves. Un dernier axe, a enfm étudié l'impact de ces facteurs confondants sur le signal immunotoxique émis par des xénobiotiques caractérisant des activités anthropiques, en condition d'exposition individuelle.L'axe méthodologique a montré l'importance critique du site anatomique de prélèvement des hémocytes pour des études immunotoxicologiques. À la suite d'ateliers internationaux d'harmonisation de méthodes d'analyses des paramètres immunitaires, un ensemble de protocoles, à standardiser, a été proposé dans le cadre de suivi de sites ateliers d'un réseau de recherche transatlantique en écotoxicologie (Réseau de Recherche sur les bivalves). Un indice cumulé immunotoxicologique a été développé, offrant une vision globale de la réponse immunotoxique. Enfin, cet axe a permis la mise au point un nouveau protocole opérationnel d'exposition individuelle, adapté à l'évaluation du risque chimique en milieu marin, autorisant une standardisation des conditions d'exposition, l'ajout de la mesure d'un trait de vie adapté à des expositions aigues ou chroniques et l'augmentation de la sécurité chimique pour l'utilisateur.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerHuman industrial, agricultural or urban activities exert chemical pressure on the marine environment. During accidents, but most often during chronic contamination of anthropogenic effluents, this pressure can generate toxic effects from the molecular scale to the ecosystem scale, disrupting the functioning of the coastal marine ecosystem. The environmental risk of these chemical substances is characterized using biomarkers. These tools allow the detection of these pollutants or their toxic effects, the prediction of these effects on ecosystems and the monitoring of their evolution. For the past twenty years, biomarkers of the immune system have been used to diagnose the immunotoxic effects of numerous groups of pollutants, on several sentinel species of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, in particular bivalves. Nevertheless, several endogenous and environmental factors can modulate the functioning of an individual's immune system and thus confuse the immunotoxic signal of the pollutant. As part of a Franco-Canadian collaboration between two research networks in ecotoxicology, the Saint Lawrence Ecotoxicology Research Network (RRESL) and the research group "molecular and physiological interactions of contaminants in the marine environment (GDR IMOPHYS), this doctoral work focused on studying the impact of certain confounding factors, with a view to validating the use of the immunotoxicological tool in the assessment of environmental risk in the marine environment.The strategy of the study was oriented along three axes, using two common model species in the environmental assessment of the marine ecosystem, due to their ecological characteristics and their economic importance, the cupped oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. A first methodological axis focused on comparing different techniques and methods for analyzing the parameters of immune defense cells in bivalves, hemocytes, developing a new individual exposure protocol and developing an overall index of the immunotoxic response. A second axis, ecophysiological, sought to study the impact of endogenous and seasonal factors on the individual functioning of the immune system in these two species of bivalves. Finally, a last axis studied the impact of these confounding factors on the immunotoxic signal emitted by xenobiotics characterizing anthropic activities, under individual exposure conditions.The methodological axis showed the critical importance of the anatomical site of hemocyte collection for immunotoxicological studies. Following international workshops for the harmonization of methods for analyzing immune parameters, a set of protocols, to be standardized, was proposed as part of the monitoring of workshop sites of a transatlantic research network in ecotoxicology (Réseau de Bivalve Research). A cumulative immunotoxicological index has been developed, offering an overall view of the immunotoxic response. Finally, this axis has enabled the development of a new operational protocol for individual exposure, adapted to the assessment of chemical risk in the marine environment, authorizing standardization of exposure conditions, the addition of the measurement of a of life suitable for acute or chronic exposures and increased chemical safety for the user.},

Partially owing to the economic and ecological hardship wrought by the alewife, state management agencies launched a salmonine (i.e., lake trout, Chinook salmon, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and brown trout (Salmo trutta)) stocking program in Lake Michigan in the mid-1960s in an attempt to initiate top-down control of alewives, restore the native lake trout, and initiate a valuable sport fishery (Madenjian et al. 2002).},

With plants, the incidence of invasiveness appears to follow a pattern known as the Tens Rule, which holds that of every 1,000 nonnative plant species introduced in a region, about 100 will escape to the wild and establish reproductive populations; of that number, 10 species will become firmly established; and 10 percent of those, or one species, will become a problem.7 Nevertheless, the relatively small percentage of introduced species that become invasive can seriously threaten native plants and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Planktonic primary production, chlorophyll a (chl a), underwater light climate, and total phosphorus were measured at 18 stations during 2001 and 2002 in eastern Lake Erie to characterize spatial and seasonal patterns in this system colonized by dreissenid mussels (Dreissena spp.). Areal production rates and chl a displayed a seasonal pattern typical of the Laurentian Great Lakes, with highest production in the early and late summer. Daily and seasonal (May-October) primary production was significantly lower nearshore than offshore. Although light attenuation was similar between nearshore and offshore, the nearshore light climate was generally more favorable for phytoplankton because of shallower mixing depths. However, chl a was significantly lower nearshore, which accounted for most of the depression in production rates. Nearshore chl a was lower than predicted from relationships with total phosphorus in comparable dreissenid-free systems. Offshore, subepilimnetic communities contributed up to 67\% of daily production but only up to 19\% of seasonal production. The depression of chl a and primary production in the nearshore was a reversal from historic patterns in eastern Lake Erie and from the pattern traditionally expected in large lakes. Decreased external nutrient loading and dreissenid colonization may both have contributed to this new spatial pattern, but dreissenids appear to be key agents. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {In this study, we assess changes in the piscivore community of four large, shallow lakes in the Kawartha Lakes region of central Ontario, Canada, over the period from 1980 to 2003 and relate these changes to temporal trends in phosphorus concentration, water clarity, and temperature. Over the 24-year period of data collection, there has been a regional-scale decline in the relative abundance of walleye (Sander vitreus) and an increase in the relative abundance of bass (Micropterus spp.) species. These changes were associated with reductions in phosphorus concentration and increases in water clarity and summer temperature. Results of a comparative field study conducted on 13 regional lakes indicate significant positive associations between concentrations of total phosphorus and chlorophyll a and zooplankton and walleye density. These data suggest that bottom-up effects are limiting walleye abundance either directly or in combination with abiotic conditions that favour bass over walleye. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {The genomics revolution has expanded from its origins in molecular biology to impact upon every discipline in the life sciences, including ecology. Several ecological questions can be profitably addressed using genomics technology, including issues of nutrient cycling, population structure, life-history variation, trophic interaction, stress responses and the ecological niche. An Introduction to Ecological Genomics focuses on three fundamental ecological questions: 1. What is the relationship between community structure and ecological function in ecosystems? 2. How can the variation in life-history patterns among species be explained from interaction between the genome and the environment? 3. To what extent can the limits of the ecological niche be understood from molecular stress responses? Each of these questions is evaluated in this book, in the light of recent advances in genomics research, paying particular attention to data obtained from sequencing and screening of environmental genomes (metagenomics), microarray-based transcription profiling, and gene expression directed by signal-transduction pathways. The chapters covering these key areas are preceded by discussions of genomics methodology and comparative genomics, and the book concludes with a chapter on integrativeapproaches such as ecological control analysis. An issue receiving particular attention is the genomic study of model species and the extrapolation of data obtained from them to an ecological context. The authors also provide a comparative survey the properties of genomes (genome size, gene families,synteny, polymorphism) for prokaryotes as well as the main eukaryotic models. This book incorporates a multitude of recent examples from microbiology, plant science, and zoology, drawing together a scattered literature in the first synthesis of the new and exciting field of ecological genomics. It will be of particular interest to senior undergraduate and graduate level students, as well as researchers in the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, genetics, and molecular biology.},

	abstract = {Improved methods are needed for the prevention and control of invasive species. We investigated the potential to control a rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) population in an isolated lake in northern Wisconsin by trapping adult crayfish and restricting fishing, thereby increasing fish populations and predation on small crayfish. Over a 3 year period, traps and predatory fishes removed substantial portions of the rusty crayfish population. We used an age-structured population model to determine which removal method had the largest effect on crayfish population growth rates. Because more crayfish were vulnerable to and removed by fish predation than by trapping, fish predation caused a larger decline in the population growth rate. However, trapping removed crayfish with the highest reproductive value and caused the largest decline in population growth rate per individual crayfish removed. Consideration of density-dependent responses to removal is necessary to predict long-term effects on rusty crayfish population dynamics. Nonetheless, our results suggest that the combination of trapping and fish predation can control established rusty crayfish populations and deserves further consideration for management.

In addition, an animal's state may affect the form of its response. This thesis examines the effects of the ecotourism activity of SCUBA diving on the behavioural time allocation and reproductive success of the blackeye goby, Coryphopterus nicholsi, in Barkley Sound, on Vancouver Island, Canada. Using remote observation in both field and laboratory experiments, I found that neither long-term behaviour nor reproductive success are affected by ongoing SCUBA diving activity. However, the immediate presence of divers does result in less time allocated to more risky behaviours. No evidence of habituation was found. Size class of gobies affects both behaviour and reproductive success, especially in a predator-free environment. Larger males allocate less time to risky behaviours, and obtain more spawnings from females, than do smaller males.    Key words.

We studied the effect of diesel oil on phyto- and zooplankton, mussels, and the applicability of the use of cotton grass for eliminating the detrimental effects of oil on test organisms. The applicability of our results are within oil combating: the more we know about which, how, and in what concentrations key species in the Gulf of Finland ecosystem respond to oil, the better we can design and focus oil combating activities to the most ecologically vulnerable areas.

	abstract = {Invasive species often have rapid and far-reaching negative impacts on populations and ecological communities. These effects are most common when invasive species have few competitors or predators. Although higher level carnivores do consume invasive species, quantitative effects of new and abundant food sources on predators have rarely been documented and, as a consequence, potentially positive effects of invasive species may be under appreciated. We investigated the effects of the invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814)) on diet composition, growth rate, and body size of the Lake Erie Water Snake (Nerodia sipedon insularum (Conant and Clay, 1937)), which is threatened in the USA and endangered in Ontario, Canada. Water Snakes have shifted their diet, and round gobies now constitute {\textgreater}92\% of prey consumed. This shift in diet has occurred in just one or two Water Snake generations, yet has resulted in more rapid growth and attainment of larger body size in Water Snakes. These positive effects may reduce predation, speed reproductive maturity, increase offspring production, and fuel population growth of this threatened species. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Often damage done to ecosystems is irreversible by the time harm has been discovered. As prevention is the first and least costly line of defence, every alien species ought to be treated as potentially invasive unless convincing evidence indicates that is not. An alternative to the reactive "dirty list" approach would be a proactive and precautionary "clean list" approach, whereby government authorities would approve importation, introduction or release only after evidence has been provided showing an alien species will not become invasive or alternatively, that an adequate monitoring and management plan exists for the. foreign species.              Presently no single government department is responsible for addressing invasive alien species in Canada. Responsibility at the federal level is divided between seven different departments based on their different responsibilities.8 It was recognized by the Canadian Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development in 2002 that "no federal department sees the big picture or has overarching authority to ensure that federal priorities are established and action is taken."9 The commissioner recommended radical reforms in government to deal with invasive species comprehensively. Either a co-ordinating agency Within an existing department or a newly created agency needs to be responsible for implementing an invasive alien species program.              If an alien species is invasive it will not stay within the boundaries of an ecosystem, province or nation. For this reason, it is suggested that the problem of invasive alien species must be addressed at the federal level. Common pathways leading to introductions of invasives need to be identified and policies developed to address them in cooperation with various government agencies and other jurisdictions at the national and international level. Most importantly, core funding needs to be allocated for a national invasive species program and the public needs to be educated about changes in behaviour that may reduce alien species introductions.},

	abstract = {We review the status of the Lake Huron fish community between 1970 and 1999 and explore the effects of key stressors. Offshore waters changed little in terms of nutrient enrichment, while phosphorus levels declined in inner Saginaw Bay. Introduced mussels (Dreissena spp.) proliferated and may have caused a decline in Diporeia spp. This introduction could have caused a decline in lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) growth and condition, with serious repercussions for commercial fisheries. Bythotrephes, an exotic predatory cladoceran, and other new exotics may be influencing the fish community. Sea lampreys (Petromyzon marinus) remained prevalent, but intensive control efforts on the St. Mary's River may reduce their predation on salmonines. Overfishing was less of a problem than in the past, although fishing continued to reduce the amount of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) spawning biomass resulting from hatchery-reared fish planted to rehabilitate this species. Massive stocking programs have increased the abundance of top predators, but lake trout were rehabilitated in only one area. Successful lake trout rehabilitation may require lower densities of introduced pelagic prey fish than were seen in the 1990s, along with continued stocking of hatchery-reared lake trout and control of sea lamprey. Such reductions in prey fish could limit Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) fisheries. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

In 1999, an MNR fish biologist told The Examiner that while fish caught by anglers were getting smaller, the overall pickerel population in the Kawarthas has been stable for 20 years. Yet five years later, the ministry reported the number of pickerel in Rice Lake had dropped to 100,000 from 800,000 over the previous 20 years. The fall-off was nearly as dramatic in Pigeon Lake, and in Lake Ontario's Bay of Quinte.


Zebra mussels, which arrived in the Kawartha Lakes in the early 1990s, are known to be a factor. They live on tiny bits of plankton, which filters the water and makes it clearer. Pickerel have large, light-sensitive eyes and prefer low-light conditions. Clearer water has been good to another invasive species, the black crappie, which push pickerel out of their natural habitat and feed on their just- hatched fry.},

Animals are a major link between the water column (pelagic) and the bottom (benthic) habitats in most shallow systems. This coupling is dominated by active processes such as suspension-feeding in which the organism actively uses energy to pump water that is then filtered to remove suspended particles that are consumed while undigested remains are deposited on the bottom. As a result of this feeding on and metabolism of particles, the animals excrete dissolved inorganic and organic waste back into the water column, and thus, become major components in the cycling and feedback of essential elements. With relatively high weight specific filtration rates of 1-- 10 liters/hour/gram dry tissue and a propensity to form large aggregated populations (beds, reefs, schools and swarms), these organisms can play an important role in regulating water column processes

	abstract = {The diet of eastern Lake Erie rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) has changed since the 1960s, reflecting food resource shifts due to phosphorus reductions and the invasion of exotic species (dreissenid mussels and Bythotrephes longimanus). Since rainbow smelt growth was lower in the 1990s than in the 1960s, we considered diet changes as an explanation. A decrease in the proportion of zooplankton occurred in the summer (May-August) diet of two size classes (63-88 and 89-114 mm fork length) between 1961 and 1999. Within the zooplankton, the proportion of Bythotrephes increased. In spite of these changes, energy density (joules per gram) of the summer (June-August) diet has not changed since 1961. However, during the late-summer and fall, predation on Bythotrephes, and therefore the proportion of indigestible spines in the stomach, increases. Using bioenergetics models, we show that Lake Erie rainbow smelt could achieve 66\%-155\% greater growth between June and October if Bythotrephes spines were replaced with digestible prey items, resulting in end-of-season weights and lengths similar to the 1985-1990 period. Our results indicate that indigestible Bythotrephes spines may reduce growth by occupying space in the stomach but providing no nutritional value to the fish, thereby reducing the realized daily ration for rainbow smelt.

	abstract = {Several crayfish species behave as biological invaders. Their establishment in an area has frequently been accompanied by the reduction or elimination of indigenous species. A laboratory study was designed to investigate whether the invasive crayfish Procambarus clarkii (Girard, 1852) is dominant over the indigenous (to Delaware) crayfish Procambarus acutus acutus (Girard, 1852) in either the absence or the presence of a shelter as a limited resource. As expected, we found that P. clarkii is more aggressive than the similarly sized P. a. acutus, thus confirming previous studies that demonstrated an inherent dominance of the invasive over the indigenous crayfish. We then hypothesized that species showing a lower preference for an offered shelter (P. clarkii) should be less motivated to defend it. To the contrary, in a competitive context P. clarkii excluded P. a. acutus from the shelter but did not use the resource. Caution must be used in extrapolating these laboratory studies to the field, and future studies should analyze multiple factors, including the autoecology of the two species and their reproductive potential and recruitment patterns. However, our results might help in highlighting the risks for freshwater biodiversity created by the uncontrolled translocations of P. clarkii and other similar invasive species.

Mean abundance of Odonata, Amphipoda, and Trichoptera decreased significantly lake-wide. Resident crayfish species nearly disappeared, although total crayfish abundance, driven by high abundances of rusty crayfish, continued to rise. Submerged macrophyte species richness declined by as much as 80\% at some locations. Together these responses demonstrate dramatic long-term changes in the littoral zone biota of Trout Lake. Continued invasions of similar lakes in the region suggest that these impacts are occurring on a region-wide basis with potentially irreversible effects on communities and ecosystems. Only through long-term natural experiments such as this study can researchers ascertain the full extent of invasions and their impacts on community and ecosystem process that respond at spatial and temporal scales not captured in mesocosm studies.

	abstract = {This thesis had two major objectives. The first was to test predictions of previous and new theories to explain variation in the timing of pair formation in waterfowl by investigating how several aspects of the winter ecology of Harlequin Ducks, including distribution and spacing behaviour, time-activity budgets, and the use of herring spawn, may be related to the process of mate choice and the timing of pair formation. The second was to identify and address some of the gaps in our knowledge of the winter ecology and demography of Harlequin Ducks that currently handicap effective conservation action. Previous theory to account for variation in the timing of pairing, that primarily considered how phenotypic, social, and ecological factors affect male costs, poorly predicted pairing behaviour in Harlequin Ducks and other waterfowl. Female Harlequin Ducks invested considerable time and energy into selecting a mate, and decisions by females about how much time and energy to allocate to the pairing process appeared to be the main factor controlling the timing of pairing. Those decisions were affected by age, previous pairing experience, time required for other activities due to seasonal differences in day-length and food availability, and group spacing that affected the availability and likely the costs of mate sampling and in turn was also related to food availability. Spacing behaviour supported the hypothesis that unpaired birds will show adaptive changes in their spacing to reduce the costs of mate sampling. Aggregating at herring spawning sites in March provided birds with both direct nutritional benefits and indirect benefits related to changes in time budgets and spacing behaviour. Male and female interests necessarily interacted and a comprehensive theory to predict variation in pairing behaviour in waterfowl and other species requires consideration of benefits, costs, and conflicts of interest among individuals engaged in pairing decisions. The process of making mate-choice decisions, how the interactions of phenotypic, social, and ecological conditions affect that process, and how individuals integrate that process with other requirements of their life history are essential to consider in order to understand variation in the timing of pairing events.},

	abstract = {The upland hardwood component of Prince Edward Island's Acadian forest is among the best remaining examples of the precolonial landscape, but it has been severely fragmented during the past 300 years of human use and settlement. Despite the ecological importance of this remnant habitat and its level of fragmentation, there has been no assessment of depth of edge or exotic plant invasion in these areas. Three 300 m long edge-interior transects were established in each of six study sites. Nine 100-m{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} circular plots were sampled along each transect at distances from 5.7 to 300 m; one external plot was established at each transect to sample species in adjacent habitats. In each plot, all vascular plants were identified, a visual estimate of percent cover was made, and soil temperature, canopy cover, and tree diameters were measured. An edge-interior plant community gradient was found within these forests; a plant community characteristic of interior conditions was not reached until a distance of more than 120 m from an edge. This suggests that upland hardwood protected areas smaller than 240 m on a side (5.75 ha) are unlikely to include interior habitat, and sites should be greater than 320 m on all sides (10.24 ha) to ensure at least some interior habitat for vascular plants. Invasion by exotic species was found to be more extensive than that reported from other jurisdictions, and innermost (300 m) plots were not free from exotics. Fifteen exotic species were found within the study sites, with Veronica officinalis (common speedwell) and Hieracium lachenalii (hawkweed) being the most invasive, both in terms of distance penetrated and area covered.

Another invading species, the zebra mussel, appears to be at the helm of this major shift, creating habitat that's right for the invading panfish, but wrong for pickerel.


[Dave Brown] and federation fisheries biologist Francine MacDonald said pickerel appear to have "disappeared" from other traditional hot spots in Lake Erie and the Bay of Quinte in Lake Ontario, areas that are also heavy with zebra mussels.},

Researchers have a "working hypothesis" that "the basic ecosystem of the lake has been significantly modified" by the presence of quagga mussels, an invasive species related to the zebra mussel, Matisoff said.


While the mussels are a prime suspect for the dead zone, there may be other contributing factors. The water levels in the Great Lakes have been dropping, which could be changing the chemistry of the water. In addition, Matisoff said, it is possible sewage and agricultural runoff are depositing more nutrients into the lake than EPA data suggests.},

Here we review patterns and mechanisms of introductions of aquatic invertebrate species into these ecosystems. Since the late 1800s, 136 free-living and 27 parasitic invertebrate species have been introduced outside their native ranges and have established reproducing populations in the Ponto-Caspian region. The bulk of these introductions are represented by crustaceans (53\%), flatworms (15\%), and molluscs (13\%). Most of the introduced species are native to other areas within the Ponto-Caspian region (37\%), with other sizable contributions from the Atlantic-Mediterranean (15\%) and boreal European-Siberian (14\%) geographic regions. Mechanisms of introductions were dominated by deliberate releases (29\%) and shipping activities (22\%), with the former occurring principally in freshwater habitats and the latter in marine and estuarine ones. Other introductions resulted from unintentional release (21\%) and hydrotechnical development (14\%), notably the construction of reservoirs and canals. Global and regional trade, particularly that mediated by commercial ships, provides dispersal opportunities for nonindigenous invertebrates to and within the Ponto-Caspian region, rapidly changing the composition of its endemic fauna.},

	abstract = {Phthalate esters (PEs) are widely used chemicals, with over 4 million tonnes being produced worldwide each year. To investigate PE bioaccumulation in a marine food web, a field study was conducted in False Creek Harbour, Vancouver, Canada. The study involved collecting samples of seawater, sediment and eighteen marine species. Samples were analyzed by GC-LRMS for eight individual phthalate congeners (i.e., dimethyl, diethyl, di-iso-butyl, di-n-butyl, butyl-benzyl, di(2-ethylhexyl), di-n-octyl, di-n-nonyl), and by LC-ESI/MS for five isomeric mixtures (i.e., di-iso-hexyl (C6), di-iso-heptyl (C7), di-iso-octyl (C8), di-iso-nonyl (C9), di-iso-decyl (C10)). Environmental concentrations were determined and corresponding fugacities were calculated. PE fugacities in the sediment were greater than those in the freely dissolved water fraction. The degree of sediment-water disequilibrium decreased with K OW from a factor of 17,700 for dimethyl phthalate to values between 2.7 and 44 for the other twelve PEs. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)},

	abstract = {Human activities have contributed to the distribution of many plant, animal and microbial species to parts of the world where they are not native. This spread of alien species can have devastating consequences on native biodiversity. Examples include alien mammals consuming native vegetation and alien insects spreading viruses, as well as plants such as water hyacinth, which has caused major problems to waterways when introduced from South America. The Global Invasive Species Programme (GISP) was established to address concerns with alien invasive species, formulated in the Convention on Biological Diversity, GISP is coordinated by: the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE); the World Conservation Union (ICUN); and CAB International. Its goal is to improve prevention and management of biological invasions, and this book represents a key outcome. It has been assembled by a team of international experts. Features include: case studies from around the globe, with some emphasis on islands; a focus on biodiversity, but with some consideration of traditional agriculture; advice on national management plans, including risk analysis.},

The introduction of salmonines to the Great Lakes date back to the 1870s, when natural populations of native salmonines in the Great Lakes were in severe decline. 
Using established evaluation protocols, it was determined that there is evidence of significant ecological effects in six different categories: (1) diseases and parasites, (2) predation on native species, (3) competition for limiting resources, (4) genetic alteration, (5) environmental alteration and (6) community alteration. Taken together, this body of evidence supports the conclusion that the ongoing introduction of non-native salmonines poses an ecologically-significant risk to the Great Lakes ecosystem and its native organisms, and that the introductions should be terminated.},

	abstract = {Voices for the Watershed is a unique look at the singular and ecologically inter-connected region of the Great Lakes-St Lawrence watershed, including the headwater and upland regions. With contributions from experts from the United States, Quebec, and Ontario, this book offers an accessible introduction to the issues affecting the quality of our most essential and precious of natural resources - clean, fresh water - from headwater regions downstream to the Great lakes, the St Lawrence river, and ultimately the watershed's outflow to the sea. With thoughtful words and evocative photography, Voices for the Watershed promotes understanding and examines ecological problems, describing positive environmental actions and projects as well as ongoing concerns over the effects of pollution on wildlife and human health. The underlying themes throughout are that the drainage basins and ecosystems are under siege - from reckless land use decisions, soil erosion, acid rain, and massive habitat destruction - but that the situation is not hopeless. The authors feel strongly that education about the environmental threats - in the classroom and public forums - is essential to effecting positive change, and that conservation actions by citizen groups and individuals can be a driving force in effecting substantial reforms regarding environmental legislation and practices. Voices for the Watershed is an eye-opening look at not only the problems but possible solutions to help protect and preserve this resilient natural resource on which so many depend.

Mr. Bailey makes use of Mark Sagoff's controversial views to suggest that non-native species are being unjustly targeted by ecologists even though they may generally cause no greater harm than native pests. Does the possibility that introduced Asian or Brown long-horn beetles will cause no greater damage than native spruce budworms mean attempts should not be made to eradicate the former? We think not. These species have the potential to cause serious economic and ecological harm to Canadian forests, and reasonable efforts ought to be made to eliminate such invaders. The fact that some type of vegetation would grow in place of tree species destroyed by exotic pests should provide us with little comfort. Unintentional introductions of pests by humans have dramatically changed the "face" of forests in eastern North America, with major losses of formerly dominant American chestnut and American elm. Certainly, native pests are costly, but we are adding to this pool with ever-increasing numbers of non-native pests; as a result, more than half (US\$35-billion) the economic losses to U.S. crop production due to insect pests and plant diseases are caused by introduced species.},

	abstract = {A hydrilla infestation swiftly obliterates the habitat of the fish and other creatures that live in the water and makes swimming, boating and fishing impossible. In Florida and elsewhere, the primary, albeit severely limited, remedies are herbicides and mechanical harvesters. Researchers have considered enlisting hydrilla-eating fish and insects and even manatees and cows, but these have proved to be, at best, of little use. Hydrilla has now spread across the southern U.S. to California and has recently appeared in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Washington State.                 More about Great Lakes invaders can be found at the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters' site, www.ofah.org; and at www.glc.great-lakes.org, which will get you into the Great Lakes Information Network. These sites are part of a continuous campaign to tell people that exotic invaders almost always arrive here with human help.                 "You can't really let up on it," says Alan Dextrase, an introductions biologist with the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. "Last week I got a call from someone who thought zebra mussels were no longer a problem because he hadn't been reading about them in the papers. They probably aren't as newsworthy as they were when they first invaded, but there always seems to be another species, like hydrilla, around the corner, and zebra mussels are certainly still spreading in Ontario."},

It evaluates institutional changes and their effects on water quality issues. It begins with an introduction of property rights and their importance in a market economy. The paper provides a brief history and description of the physical characteristics of the lakes. The history of regulation in the Great Lakes is explained from the early common law remedies to centralized legislative control beginning in the 1970's. Cost data show that the command and control policies used to control pollution in the Great Lakes are cost-ineffective and Pareto-inefficient. The failure of regulation to meet environmental goals a explained by reference to public choice theory. Centralized, control of the Great Lakes does not provide the incentive structure allocate resources efficiently. The author recommends privatization of the Great Lakes as a means of controlling externalities and of providing incentives to overcome information problems.},

	abstract = {I examined female and male reproductive strategies in a colour-banded population of Red-necked Phalaropes (Phalaropus lobatus) in a 10 year study in western Alaska. This study examined: (1) seasonal variation in reproductive strategies, (2) sex allocation, (3) paternity, and (4) factors limiting polyandry. Although only a small proportion (10\%) of females became polyandrous, first mates of these females often benefited (50\% of cases) by fertilizing an egg in clutches incubated by second males. I found costs for both sexes associated with early nesting, however, including: smaller egg size, longer time to produce a clutch, and longer incubation duration. Eggs laid early in the season were exposed to predators up to 42\% longer than those in later nests, and predation on nests tended to be greater towards the start and end of the nesting season. Polyandrous females were in better body condition initially, showed no seasonal trend in body condition, and produced larger eggs, and proportionately more male chicks than monogamous females. DNA analyses showed that extra-pair fertilizations (EPFs) were low overall: 1.7\% of 226 chicks, with one chick in each of 4 out of 63 total clutches. Second males of polyandrous females faced substantial risk, however, with 3 of 6 such clutches containing EPF young, in contrast to no EPF young in a female's first clutch (n = 25) and only 1 in 16 monogamous replacement clutches. Males appear to pursue a mixed reproductive strategy. They mate guard strongly, by approaching and accompanying females more often than reported for other shorebirds. Males increase within-pair copulation attempts coincident with the female's fertile period, but further increase attempts beyond the fertile period, apparently in an attempt to fertilize the next clutch. Renesting males guard against cuckoldry risk by repairing with their original females or by leaving the area. Although 76\% of polyandrous nestings involved renesting males, only 6\% of renesting males changed mates if the original female was still available. Moreover, polyandry rates did not increase with an increase in males recycled into the breeding pool. I conclude that the breeding system of phalaropes is fundamentally a renesting system that favors male incubation, and that polyandry occurs primarily when original females are unavailable to renesting males.},

In recent years, population declines have been speculated over much of the Marbled Murrelet's range resulting in its classification as a "threatened" species in Canada. Marbled Murrelets are difficult to study due to their cryptic nesting behaviour, sensitivity to disturbance, and habitat requirements that typically restrict them to relatively isolated and inaccessible locations. Traditional methods of studying the population dynamics of seabirds, such as the regular visitation of large numbers of nests, are therefore not readily applicable to the Marbled Murrelet, and as a result, little is known about their ecology and breeding biology. The primary goal of my research was to test and develop novel molecular and physiological techniques that could indirectly provide information about the breeding biology of the Marbled Murrelet.

	abstract = {That doesn't mean that the purple loosestrife, for instance, isn't threatening wetlands. In an attempt to contain the vibrantly colored plant, biologists have introduced European beetles that are, even now, munching through stands of loosestrife across southern Ontario. It will take several years to see if this works.                 Meanwhile, the war against purple loosestrife has been spearheaded by Ducks Unlimited, a group primarily concerned with maintaining healthy wetlands for the ducks they like to kill. As for the zebra mussel, environmentalist R.G Davis has written that it has "disturbed commercial, industrial and municipal uses of the Great Lakes, but this is not the mollusk's fault. Only industrial and commercial use and abuse of the waters makes the zebra mussel a pest."              Canadian Press Forget big, green monsters, we've got zebra mussels invading our lakes, loosestrife destroying wetlands, and now "greedy" goby feasting on innocent yellow perch. Last summer, Don MacIvor, of Shelburne, Ont., and his son Danny (left), introduced Galerucella beetles to a field of purple loosestrife in Cambridge. The European beetles are munching their way through stands of loosestrife across southern Ontario to save the wetlands.},

Now, prominent limnologists are concerned about this important field, citing the lack of adequate educational programs and other issues. Freshwater Ecosystems responds with recommendations for strengthening the field and ensuring the readiness of the next generation of practitioners. Highlighted with case studies, this book explores limnology's place in the university structure and the need for curriculum reform, with concrete suggestions for curricula and field research at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. The volume examines the wide-ranging career opportunities for limnologists and recommends strategies for integrating limnology more fully into water resource decision management. Freshwater Ecosystems tells the story of limnology and its most prominent practitioners and examines the current strengths and weaknesses of the field. The committee discusses how limnology can contribute to appropriate policies for industrial waste, wetlands destruction, the release of greenhouse gases, extensive damming of rivers, the zebra mussel and other "invasions" of species-- the broad spectrum of problems that threaten the nation's freshwater supply. Freshwater Ecosystems provides the foundation for improving a field whose importance will continue to increase as human populations grow and place even greater demands on freshwater resources. This volume will be of value to administrators of university and government science programs, faculty and students in aquatic science, aquatic resource managers, and clean-water advocates--and it is readily accessible to the concerned individual.

Assessment of extinction risk and decisions under the ESA--how these decisions can be made more effectively. The book concludes with a look beyond the Endangered Species Act and suggests additional means of biological conservation and ways to reduce conflicts.
