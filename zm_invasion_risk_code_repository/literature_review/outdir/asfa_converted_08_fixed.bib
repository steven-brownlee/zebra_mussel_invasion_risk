	doi = {10.1101/2021.08.26.457769},
	abstract = {Microbial drug discovery programs rely heavily on accessing bacterial diversity from the environment to acquire new specialized metabolite (SM) lead compounds for the therapeutic pipeline. Therefore, knowledge of how certain bacterial taxa are distributed in nature, in addition to the degree of variation of SM production within those taxa, is critical to informing these front-end discovery efforts and making the overall sample collection and bacterial library creation process more efficient. In the current study we employed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and the bioinformatics pipeline IDBac to analyze diversity within phylotype groupings and SM profiles of hundreds of bacterial isolates from two Eunapius fragilis freshwater sponges, collected 1.5 km apart. We demonstrated that within two sponge samples of the same species, the culturable bacterial populations contained significant overlap in approximate genus-level phylotypes but mostly non-overlapping populations of isolates when grouped lower than the level of genus. Further, correlations between bacterial phylotype and SM production varied at the species level and below, suggesting SM distribution within bacterial taxa must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Our results suggest that two E. fragilis freshwater sponges collected in similar environments can exhibit large culturable diversity on a species-level scale, thus researchers should scrutinize the isolates with analyses that take both phylogeny and SM production into account in order to optimize the chemical space entering into a downstream bacterial library.

	doi = {10.21203/rs.3.rs-43571/v3},
	abstract = {Background
Nutrient stoichiometry of phytoplankton frequently changes with aquatic ambient nutrient concentrations, which is mainly influenced by anthropogenic water treatment and the ecosystem dynamics. Consequently, the stoichiometry of phytoplankton can markedly alter the metabolism and growth of zooplankton. However, the effects of nutrient-imbalanced prey on the interplay between zooplankton and their gut microbiota remain unknown. Using metatranscriptome, a 16s rRNA amplicon-based neutral community model (NCM) and experimental validation, we investigated the interactions between Daphnia magna and its gut microbiota in a nutrient-imbalanced algal diet.
Results
Our results showed that in nutrient-depleted water, the nutrient-enriched zooplankton gut stimulated the accumulation of microbial polyphosphate in fecal pellets under phosphorus limitation and the microbial assimilation of ammonia under nitrogen limitation. Compared with the nutrient replete group, both N and P limitation markedly promoted the gene expression of the gut microbiome for organic matter degradation but repressed that for anaerobic metabolisms. In the nutrient limited diet, the gut microbial community exhibited a higher fit to NCM (R2=0.624 and 0.781, for N- and P-limitation, respectively) when compared with the Control group (R2=0.542), suggesting increased ambient-gut exchange process favored by compensatory feeding. Further, an additional axenic grazing experiment revealed that the growth of D. magna can still benefit from gut microbiota under a nutrient-imbalanced diet.
Conclusions
Together, these results demonstrated that under a nutrient-imbalanced diet, the microbes not only benefit themselves by absorbing excess nutrients inside the zooplankton gut but also help zooplankton to survive during nutrient limitation.},

The sandhopper Talitrus saltator s. l. (Montagu, 1808) typically lives on supralittoral shores where it plays an important ecological role. The purpose of this study was to investigate DNA damage levels on hemocytes of T. saltator by means of the Comet assay. Firstly, we tested the sensitivity and reproducibility of the Comet assay on hemocytes of T. saltator after in vitro exposure (1 h) to the genotoxicant methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The data demonstrated a DNA damage (defined as \% DNA tail) related to MMS exposure in a concentration-dependent manner. Next, we carried out the assay on hemocytes of T. saltator that were exposed in vivo (24 h and 7 days) to (a) lead (Pb), (b) benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), (c) mixtures of them. Our data on exposure to Pb or B(a)P showed DNA damage on the hemocytes of T. saltator in a concentration-dependent manner, but apparently with a non-synergistic effect of exposure to their mixtures. Our results provide a background for further studies in order to verify the applicability of Comet assay on T. saltator for assessing genotoxicity levels in sandy beaches subjected to pollution.},

	abstract = {Lakes are often defined by seasonal cycles. The seasonal timing, or phenology, of many lake processes, such as primary productivity, are changing in response to human activities. However, long-term records exist for few lakes, and extrapolating patterns observed in these lakes to entire landscapes is exceedingly difficult using the limited number of in situ observations that are available. Limited landscape level observations means we do not know how common shifts in lake phenology are at macroscales. Here, we use a new remote sensing dataset, LimnoSat-US, to analyze U.S. summer lake color phenology between 1984 and 2020 across more than 26,000 lakes. Our results show that summer lake color seasonality can be generalized into five distinct phenology groups that follow well-known patterns of phytoplankton succession. The frequency with which lakes transition from one phenology group to another is tied to lake and landscape level characteristics. Lakes with high discharge and low variation in their seasonal extent are generally more stable while lakes in areas with high interannual variations in climate and catchment population density show less stability. Our research reveals previously unexamined spatiotemporal patterns in lake seasonality and demonstrates the utility of LimnoSat-US, which, with over 22 million remote sensing observations of lakes, creates novel opportunities to systematically examine changing lotic ecosystems at a national scale.},

A lone wild wolf lives on a small group of uninhabited islands in British Columbia's Salish Sea, surrounded by freighter, oil tanker and other boat traffic and in close proximity to a large urban area. His name is Takaya, which is the Coast Salish First Nations people's word for wolf. Cheryl Alexander studied and documented this unique wolf for years, unravelling the many mysteries surrounding his life. Her documentation of Takaya's journey, his life on the islands and the development of their deep connection is presented alongside a stunning collection of her photography. Through journal entries, interviews, and a stunning collection of photography, Takaya: Lone Wolf addresses a number of profound questions and tells a story that is certain to inspire, enlighten, and touch the heart.

	abstract = {Abstract
The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is a marine bivalve species with vital roles in coastal ecosystems and aquaculture globally. While extensive genomic tools are available for C. gigas, highly contiguous reference genomes are required to support both fundamental and applied research. In the current study, high coverage long and short read sequence data generated on Pacific Biosciences and Illumina platforms from a single female individual specimen was used to generate an initial assembly, which was then scaffolded into 10 pseudo chromosomes using both Hi-C sequencing and a high density SNP linkage map. The final assembly has a scaffold N50 of 58.4 Mb and a contig N50 of 1.8 Mb, representing a step advance on the previously published C. gigas assembly. The new assembly was annotated using Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq data, identifying 30K putative protein coding genes, with an average of 3.9 transcripts per gene. Annotation of putative repeat elements highlighted an inverse relationship with gene density, and identified putative centromeres of the metacentric chromosomes. An enrichment of Helitron rolling circle transponsable elements was observed, suggesting their potential role in shaping the evolution of the C. gigas genome. This new chromosome-level assembly will be an enabling resource for genetics and genomics studies to support fundamental insight into bivalve biology, as well as for genetic improvement of C. gigas in aquaculture breeding programmes.

	abstract = {Nanoscience is a multidisciplinary area of science which enables researchers to create tools that help in understanding the mechanisms related to the interactions between nanomaterials and biomolecules (nanotechnology). Nanomaterials represent nanotechnology products. These products have an enormous impact on technical industries and the quality of human life. Nanomaterials directly or indirectly have to interact with biosystems. It is, therefore, essential to understand the beneficial and harmful interactions of nanomaterials with and within a biosystem, especially with reference to humans. This book provides primary and advanced information concerning the interactions between nanomaterials and the components of a typical biosystem to readers. Chapters in the book cover, in a topic-based approach, the many facets of nanomolecular interactions with biological molecules and systems that influence their behavior, bioavailability and biocompatibility (including nucleic acids, cell membranes, tissues, enzymes and antibodies). A note on the applications of nanomaterials is also presented in the conclusion of the book to illustrate the usefulness of this class of materials. The contents of the book will benefit students, researchers, and technicians involved in the fields of biological sciences, such as cell biology, medicine, molecular biology, food technology, cosmetology, pharmacology, biotechnology, and environmental sciences. The book also provides information for the material science personnel, enabling them to understand the basics of target-oriented nanomaterials design for specific objectives.},

Health, the environment, the welfare of society are pushed to the far edge of national interests. Instead, GDP and short-term monetary profit is prioritised over long-term impact on society and the environment. The world as we know it is set for collapse. Simultaneously, the science of evolution has itself evolved. In as much as "survival of the fittest" has been used to justify harsh, competition behaviour on the part of individuals and corporations, an updated understanding of evolution now tends to tell us a different story. What if written into the code of our DNA and RNA is a guide for telling us how to evolve morally and as a result improve our world and progress our epistemology?

Suspension-grown CHO cells were separately incubated with etoposide, bleomycin, and ethyl methanesulfonate and analyzed by an alkaline comet assay and GC-MS/MS. Although DNA strand breaks were detected by the comet assay after treatment with all three agents, GC-MS/MS could only detect DNA nucleobase lesions oxidatively induced by bleomycin. This demonstrates that although GC-MS/MS has limitations in detection of genotoxic effects, it can be used for selected chemical genotoxins that contribute to oxidizing processes. The comet assay, used in combination with GC-MS/MS, can be a more useful approach to screen a wide range of chemical genotoxins as well as to monitor other DNA-damaging factors.},

	abstract = {OGG1-deficient (Ogg1-/-) animals display increased propensity to age-induced and diet-induced metabolic diseases, including insulin resistance and fatty liver. Since the intestinal microbiome is increasingly understood to play a role in modulating host metabolic responses, we examined gut microbial composition in Ogg1-/- mice subjected to different nutritional challenges. Interestingly, Ogg1-/- mice had a markedly altered intestinal microbiome under both control-fed and hypercaloric diet conditions. Several microbial species that were increased in Ogg1-/- animals were associated with increased energy harvest, consistent with their propensity to high-fat diet induced weight gain. In addition, several pro-inflammatory microbes were increased in Ogg1-/- mice. Consistent with this observation, Ogg1-/- mice were significantly more sensitive to intestinal inflammation induced by acute exposure to dextran sulfate sodium. Taken together, these data indicate that in addition to their proclivity to obesity and metabolic disease, Ogg1-/- mice are prone to colonic inflammation. Further, these data point to alterations in the intestinal microbiome as potential mediators of the metabolic and intestinal inflammatory response in Ogg1-/- mice.},

With contributions from climate activists and engaged young authors, this volume explores the many ways in which people are proactively working to advance climate justice. The book pays special attention to Canada and the Great Lakes watershed, showing how the effects of climate change span local, regional, and global scales through the impact of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, with related economic and social effects that cross political jurisdictions. Examining examples of local-level activism that include organizing for climate-resilient and equitable communities, the dynamic leadership of Indigenous peoples (especially women) for water and land protection, and diaspora networking, Local Activism for Global Climate Justice also provides theoretical perspectives on how individual action relates to broader social and political processes. Showcasing a diverse range of inspirational and thought-provoking case studies, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of climate justice, climate change policy, climate ethics, and global environmental governance, as well as teachers and climate activists.},

	abstract = {Presents recent challenges related to new forms of pollution from industries and discusses adequate state-of-the-art technologies capable to remediate such forms of pollution. 
Over the past few decades the boom in the industrial sector has contributed to the release in the environment of pollutants that have no regulatory status and which may have significant impact on the health of humans and animals. These pollutants also referred to as "emerging pollutants", are mostly aromatic compounds which derive from excretion of pharmaceutical, industrial effluents and municipal discharge. It is recurrent these days to find water treatment plants which no longer produce water that fits the purpose of domestic consumption based on newly established guidelines. This situation has prompted water authorities and researchers to develop tools for proper prediction and control of the dispersion of pollutants in the environment to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to prevent the occurrence of outbreaks due to sudden load of these pollutants in the water system.
The chapters in this book cover a wide range of nano and bio-based techniques that have been designed for the real time detection of emerging contaminants in environmental water sources, geochemical models that are continuously improved for the prediction of inorganic contaminants migration from the mine solid wastes into ground and surface waters. Remediation strategies are also discussed and include effective techniques based on nanotechnology, advanced membrane filtration, oxidative and bio-degradation processes using various types of nanocatalysts, biocatalysts or supporting polymer matrices which are under advanced investigations for their implementation at large scale for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants from polluted water.

Nano and Bio-Based Technologies for Wastewater Treatment: Prediction and Control Tools for the Dispersion of Pollutants in the Environment is divided is two sections. The first section covers the occurrence of emerging pollutants in environmental water while the second section covers state-of-the-art research on the removal of emerging pollutants from water using sustainable technologies. A total of 13 chapters addressing various topics related to the two sections are essentially based on recent developments in the respective field which could have a significant impact on the enhancement of the performance of wastewater treatment plants around the world, and especially in developing countries where access to clean and safe water remains a daily challenge.

Although most of these pests can complete their life cycles in any given relative humidity, their prolonged development time, as well as decreased emergence rate and fecundity, have been well documented in several previous studies. In the present study, we evaluated the changes in energetic substances (lipids, soluble carbohydrates, glycogen, and proteins) accumulated in different life stages of larvae and adults of Tribolium castaneum in response to different relative humidity levels (5, 12, 22, 30, 45, and 65\%). The results showed that young larvae were more susceptible to low relative humidity levels and desiccation stress. Larvae tended to accumulate higher proportions of lipids during earlier stages while their energy content shifted towards proteins with an increase in their age. Adult beetles experienced a significant decrease in their protein content immediately after they initiated reproduction. The importance of these fluctuations in the biology of the red flour beetles was discussed in detail.},

Regulatory Toxicology in the European Union is the first book to cover regulatory toxicology specifically in Europe. It addresses the need for a wider understanding of the principles of regulatory toxicology and their application and presents the relationship between toxicology and legislative processes in regulating chemical commodities across Europe. This title has a broad scope, covering historical and current chemical regulation in Europe, the role of European agencies and institutions, and also the use of toxicology data for important classes of chemicals, including human and veterinary medicines, animal feed and food additives, biocides, pesticides and nanomaterials. This book is therefore extremely pertinent and timely in the toxicology field at present.

	abstract = {As a developed city in China, Wenzhou City has been suffered from bad water quality for years. In order to improve the river network water quality, an ecological water diversion project was designed and executed by the regional government. In this study, an investigation and analysis of the regional ecological water diversion project is made for the purpose of examining the water quality improvements. A numerical model is also established, different water diversion flow rates and sewer interception levels are considered during the simulation. Simulation results reveal that higher flow rate and sewer interception level will greatly improve the river network water quality in Wenzhou City. The importance of the flow rate and interception level has been proved and future work will be focused on increasing the flow rate and upgrading the sewer interception level.},

More specific disease orientated chapters comprehensively summarize the clinical, genetic, molecular, animal model, molecular pathology, diagnostic, counseling, and treatment aspects of each disorder. The book is organized into five sections that each emphasize a particular theme, general background to bone biology, general background to genetics and epigenetics, disorders of bone and joint, parathyroid and related disorders, and vitamin D and renal disorders. 
The first section is specifically devoted to providing an overview of bone biology and structure, joint and cartilage biology, principles of endocrine regulation of bone, and the role of neuronal regulation and energy homeostasis. The second section reviews the principles and progress of medical genetics and epigenetics related to bone disease, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genomic profiling, copy number variation, prospects of gene therapy, pharmacogenomics, genetic testing and counseling, as well as the generation and utilizing of mouse models.
The third section details advances in the genetics and molecular biology of bone and joint diseases, both monogenic and polygenic, as well as skeletal dysplasias, and rarer bone disorders. The fourth section highlights the central role of the parathyroids in calcium and skeletal homeostasis by reviewing the molecular genetics of: hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyrodism, endocrine neoplasias, and disorders of the PTH and calcium-sensing receptors. The fifth section details molecular and cellular advances across associated renal disorders such as vitamin D and rickets.

Identifies and analyzes the genetic basis of bone disorders in humans and demonstrates the utility of mouse models in furthering the knowledge of mechanisms and evaluation of treatments
Demonstrates how the interactions between bone and joint biology, physiology, and genetics have greatly enhanced the understanding of normal bone function as well as the molecular pathogenesis of metabolic bone disorders

	abstract = {Handbook of Epigenetics: The New Molecular and Medical Genetics, Second Edition, provides a comprehensive analysis of epigenetics, from basic biology, to clinical application. Epigenetics is considered by many to be the new genetics in that many biological phenomena are controlled, not through gene mutations, but rather through reversible and heritable epigenetic processes. These epigenetic processes range from DNA methylation to prions. The biological processes impacted by epigenetics are vast and encompass effects in lower organisms and humans that include tissue and organ regeneration, X-chromosome inactivation, stem cell differentiation, genomic imprinting, and aging. 
The first edition of this important work received excellent reviews; the second edition continues its comprehensive coverage adding more current research and new topics based on customer and reader reviews, including new discoveries, approved therapeutics, and clinical trials. From molecular mechanisms and epigenetic technology, to discoveries in human disease and clinical epigenetics, the nature and applications of the science is presented for those with interests ranging from the fundamental basis of epigenetics, to therapeutic interventions for epigenetic-based disorders.

Timely and comprehensive collection of fully up-to-date reviews on epigenetics that are organized into one volume and written by leading figures in the field

The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were characterized by grandiose engineering projects-the Erie Canal, the Saint Lawrence Seaway, and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal-that were designed to connect the Great Lakes to other bodies of water, carving new paths for commercial freighters.

[...]these manmade channels opened the doors to a host of invasive species that destroyed the lakes' native fish populations and led to several major die-offs.

A concise but thorough reference work, this book:- Covers key viral and bacterial diseases of notable fish species;- Reviews major well-established piscine pathogens as well as new, emerging and notifiable diseases; and- Contains the most up-to-date research contributed by a team of over fifty world experts.An invaluable bench book for fish health consultants, veterinarians and all those wanting instant access to information, this book is also a useful textbook for students specializing in fish health and research scientists initiating fish disease research programmes.Patrick T K Woo (ptkw) is University Professor Emeritus, University of Guelph, and has been a faculty member since 1974. His research program focused on parasitic flagellates which included those of medical and economic importance. The program had continuous NSERC support for over 40 years, until he closed his laboratory at U of G so he could, with his co-editors, focus on formulating and editing an interdisciplinary book series on 'climate change and fish health'. Patrick's research and travels, sponsored by other agencies (e.g. FAO, United Nations; National University of Singapore; CNPq, Brazil; MEC, Spain; NEC, Cdn.; CIDA, Cdn.; IDRC, Cdn) allowed him to work with colleagues in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas (e.g. 'determine the toxicity of cadmium on tilapia and its effects on immune response' in Singapore; 'develop and evaluate diagnostic techniques for human trypanosomiasis' in E \& W Africa; 'adapt an in vitro method to study fish innate immunity' in Spain). In addition to publishing papers and review articles in journals and books, Patrick edited a special journal issue and 14 academic books on fish health.

	abstract = {Since absolute dating of rock art is limited, relative chronologies remain useful in contextualising interpretations of ancient images. This book advocates the archival capacity of rock art and uses archival perspectives to analyse the chronology of paintings in order to formulate a framework for their historicised interpretations. The Western Cape painting sequence is customarily accepted to include the hunter-gatherer phase from c. 10,000 BP, pastoralism from c. 2,000 BP and finally the historical-cum-colonial period several centuries ago. Painting traditions with distinct depiction manners and content are conventionally linked to these broad periods. This study evaluates this schema in order to refine the diverse hunter-gatherer, herder and colonial era painting contexts and histories. Using superimpositions as one analytical tool, the notion of datum aided the referencing and correlation of layered imagery into a relative sequence. Although broad differences separate painting traditions, and these variations are generally indistinguishable within a single tradition, it is clear that the long-spanning hunter-gatherer segment of painting in this region reflects a hitherto unrecognised sub-tradition. Some painted themes such as elephants, fat-tailed sheep, handprints and possibly finger dots occur within various levels of the sequence, which this study views as shared graphic fragments occurring between and across traditions and sub-traditions. Through the archival concept of respect des fonds such observable complexities were clarified as coherent graphic narratives that run through the entire chronological sequence of the Western Cape rock paintings. Probing archaeological, ethnographic and historical sources revealed that while these themes remained fundamentally consistent throughout the stratigraphic sequence as preferred subject matter, their meanings might have transformed subliminally from earlier to later periods, possibly reflecting layered shifts in the socio-economic, cultural and political circumstances of the region. Fundamentally, the framework of image histories shown by the choice and sustenance of specific themes is understood to mean that their significance and specific graphic contexts throughout the chronological sequence are pivoted and mirrored through the long established hunter-gatherer rock paintings which predate periods of contact with other cultures. The resulting sequence and interpretation of these painted themes is a descriptive and organisational template reflecting the original organic character in the creation of the paintings and ordered cultural continuities in the use of animal/human symbolism. This book's agenda in part involves reviewing the Western Cape's changing social and historical landscape to show variation in painting over time and to project possible interpretative transformations. Painting sequences and cultural (dis)continuities are thus intricately entwined and can be disentangled through a recursive analytical relationship between archaeology, ethnography and history. This amalgamated analytical approach produces historicised narratives and contextual meanings for the rock paintings.},

	abstract = {With more than a thousand new entries and more than 2,300 word-frequency ratios, the magisterial fourth edition of this book-now renamed Garner's Modern English Usage (GMEU)-reflects usage lexicography at its finest. Garner explains the nuances of grammar and vocabulary with thoroughness, finesse, and wit. He discourages whatever is slovenly, pretentious, or pedantic.GMEU is the liveliest and most compulsively readable reference work for writers of our time. It delights while providing instruction on skillful, persuasive, and vivid writing. Garner liberates English from two extremes: both from the hidebound "purists" who mistakenly believe that split infinitives and sentence-ending prepositions are malfeasances and from the linguistic relativists who believe that whatever people say or write must necessarily be accepted.The judgments here are backed up not just by a lifetime of study but also by an empirical grounding in the largest linguistic corpus ever available. In this fourth edition, Garner has made extensive use of corpus linguistics to include ratios of standard terms as compared against variants in modern print sources. No other resource provides as comprehensive, reliable, and empirical a guide to current English usage.For all concerned with writing and editing, GMEU will prove invaluable as a desk reference. Garner illustrates with actual examples, cited with chapter and verse, all the linguistic blunders that modern writers and speakers are prone to, whether in word choice, syntax, phrasing, punctuation, or pronunciation. No matter how knowledgeable you may already be, you're sure to learn from every single page of this book.},

	abstract = {The distribution and function of microorganisms are of crucial importance for the flow of matter in the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. Effects of microbial communities on the carbon and nitrogen cycles are particularly important for producing climate gases such as CO2, CH4, or N2O. However, the biogeochemical cycles are reversely impacted by global climate change, for example by increasing temperature, increasing CO2concentration, or changing soil humidity. However microbes may respond differently, by accelerating or by alleviating, human-caused climate change. Understanding of microbial ecology in the different ecosystems on Earth, such as soil, oceans, or inland waters, is essential for our ability to assess the importance of biogeochemical cycles-climate feedbacks. Unfortunately, microbial communities are extremely complex in structure and function and can be affected by climate and other global changes in many ways, which impedes our ability to draw reliable conclusions. In this book, a broad range of renowned scientists reviews the most important hot-topics in the area of climate change and microbial ecology, thus providing a timely and authoritative overview of this increasingly important area. Individual chapters cover the various ecosystems on Earth as well as the different groups of microorganisms with respect to different cycles of matter. In addition, special chapters cover applied aspects, such as land-use and geoengineering. This is an essential book for every microbial ecologist from the PhD student to the experienced scientist and is also recommended for everyone interested in the field of global climate change.},

	abstract = {The challenges facing General Dwight Eisenhower before the Invasion of Normandy were not merely military but political as well. He knew that to liberate France, and to hold it, the Allies needed local help, which would necessitate coordinating with the highly independent French resistance groups known collectively as the maquis. The Allies' objective was to push the Germans out of France. The French objective, on the other hand, was a France free of all foreign armies, including the Allies. President Roosevelt refused to give full support to Charles de Gaulle, whom he mistrusted, and declined to supply the timing, location, and other key details of Operation Overlord to his Free French government. Eisenhower's hands were tied. He needed to involve the French, but without simultaneously involving them in operational planning.Into this atmosphere of tension and confusion jumped teams consisting of three officers each -- one from the British Special Operations Bureau, one from the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, one from the Free French Bureau Central de Renseignement -- as well as a radioman from any one of the three nations. Known as the Jedburghs, their primary purpose was to serve as liaisons to the maquis, working to arm, train, and equip them. They were to incite guerilla warfare.Benjamin Jones' Eisenhower's Guerrillas is the first book to show in detail how the Jedburghs -- whose heroism and exploits have been widely celebrated -- and the maquis worked together. Underscoring the critical and often overlooked role that irregular warfare played in Allied operations on the Continent, it tells the story of the battle for and liberation of France and the complexities that threatened to undermine the operation before it even began.},

	abstract = {PHF13 is a chromatin affiliated protein with a functional role in differentiation, cell division, DNA damage response and higher chromatin order. To gain insight into PHF13's ability to modulate these processes, we elucidate the mechanisms targeting PHF13 to chromatin, its genome wide localization and its molecular chromatin context. Size exclusion chromatography, mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography and ChIP sequencing demonstrate that PHF13 binds chromatin in a multivalent fashion via direct interactions with H3K4me2/3 and DNA, and indirectly via interactions with PRC2 and RNA PolII. Furthermore, PHF13 depletion disrupted the interactions between PRC2, RNA PolII S5P, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 and resulted in the up and down regulation of genes functionally enriched in transcriptional regulation, DNA binding, cell cycle, differentiation and chromatin organization. Together our findings argue that PHF13 is an H3K4me2/3 molecular reader and transcriptional co-regulator, affording it the ability to impact different chromatin processes.DOI:

The economic cost, of trying to contain the invaders, of decreased crop production and the need for increased and new pesticides, of losses of forest resources, is estimated at \$120 billion a year in the United States.

While some might argue that change is normal and that it shouldn't be surprising to see some species die out, Stohlgren says the loss of biodiversity has a real cost.

	abstract = {Total-reflection X-ray fluorescence, or TXRF, and its related methods have been used increasingly for multi element analysis in laboratories and industry worldwide. Providing reliable, economical readings of the minute mass or extremely low concentration of elements, TXRF is especially suitable for ultramicro- and trace analysis. It is also effective in the analysis of flat sample surfaces and stratified near-surface layers, offering a nondestructive means of quality control of wafers for the semiconductor industry by a fast mapping of possible unwanted contaminations.

The new edition is completely updated and nearly doubled. Particular emphasis has been placed on new methods and techniques including: Silicon-drift detector with Peltier-cooling, powerful and particular excitation by synchrotron radiation, simple wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometer especially for light element detection and speciation, TXRF after chemical and physical etching of thin layers to give information on the nanometer-scale, GI-XRF for non-destructive depth profiling of thin flat coverings and implantations, TXRF combined with EXAFS, XANES, XRD, and XPS to gain insight into the molecular and even into the electronic structure of atoms.
Total-Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence Analysis helps professionals evaluate the suitability of this method to their specific needs, pinpoint new applications, and gain insight into the future of TXRF. It is an excellent text for graduate students and a useful guide for scientists and technicians in a wide range of fields.

Total-Reflection X-ray Fluorescence Analysis and Related Methods, Second Edition features:


The uses of TXRF in ultramicro- and trace analysis, and in surface- and near-surface-layer analysis
Instrumentation and setups, particularly high-power X-ray sources, beam-adapting units, sample positioning, and energy-dispersive detection and registration
Explores new applications of TRXF since the publication of the first edition
Offers helpful tips on performing analyses, including sample preparations, and spectra recording and interpretation
Includes about 700 references for further study
Written by leading experts in X-ray spectral analysis, the second edition provides an overview of the field, reveals the advantages of TXRF over competing methods, and describes its application in numerous fields, including biology, biomonitoring, material and life sciences, medicine, toxicology, forensics, art history, and archaeometry.

With chapters on polar explorer films, silent cinema, documentaries, ethnographic and indigenous film, gender and ecology, as well as Hollywood and the USSR's uses and abuses of the Arctic, this book provides a groundbreaking account of Arctic cinemas from 1898 to the present. Challenging dominant notions of the region in popular and political culture, it demonstrates how moving images (cinema, television, video, and digital media) have been central to the very definition of the Arctic since the end of the nineteenth century. Bringing together an international array of European, Russian, Nordic, and North American scholars, Films on Ice radically alters stereotypical views of the Arctic region, and therefore of film history itself.Scott MacKenzie teaches in the Department of Film and Media, and is cross-appointed to the Graduate Program in Cultural Studies, at Queen's University, CanadaAnna Westerståhl Stenport is Associate Professor of Scandinavian Studies and Media and Cinema Studies, and Director of the European Union Center, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

	abstract = {Rural regions are experiencing fundamental challenges to their ways of life and social fabric, as traditional land-based occupations are in decline and younger and better-educated rural residents migrate to cities for greater work, social and cultural opportunities. Rural tourism offers a possible solution to the problems associated with lost economic opportunities and population decline that accompany the waning of agriculture. Many governments and regional authorities have embraced rural tourism as an opportunity to bring new money into rural regions, stimulating growth, providing employment opportunities and thus beginning to halt rural decline. However, the possibilities of rural tourism to promote rural regeneration have been criticised for being over-stated and unrealistic. Rural tourism has frequently been found to under-deliver in terms of expected economic benefits and job creation, and may sometimes exacerbate local hierarchies and inequalities. This edited collection questions the contribution tourism can and does make to rural regions. Drawing on a range of geographically diverse, research-driven case studies, the book is thematically organised to explore a variety of issues relevant to rural tourism, from the perspectives of local communities, businesses, government/policy makers and the tourists themselves.},

This is important because recommendations in the literature are often conflicting; part of the evaluation of the published results and reviews is to guide the reader to make suitable choices through discussion of the reasons for diverse recommendations. Also included is much more on the nutritional values of fruit and vegetables, and how these may vary and change postharvest. There is also additional information on the origin, domestication and taxonomy of fruit and vegetables, putting recommendations in context.


Fruits and Vegetables 3e is essential reading for fruit and vegetable technologists, food scientists and food technologists, agricultural scientists, commercial growers, shippers, packhouse operatives and personnel within packaging companies. Researchers and upper level students in food science, food technology, plant and agricultural sciences will find a great deal of use within this popular book.

In addition, it covers research ethics, laws and industrial pitfalls that are of particular importance for the future production of tissue constructs. 
Tissue Engineering is an interdisciplinary field of biomedical research, which combines life, engineering and materials sciences, to progress the maintenance, repair and replacement of diseased and damaged tissues. This ever-emerging area of research applies an understanding of normal tissue physiology to develop novel biomaterial, acellular and cell-based technologies for clinical and non-clinical applications. As evident in numerous medical disciplines, tissue engineering strategies are now being increasingly developed and evaluated as potential routine therapies for oral and craniofacial tissue repair and regeneration.
Diligently covers all the aspects related to stem cell biology and tissue engineering in dental sciences: basic science, research, clinical application and commercialization.
Provides detailed descriptions of new, modern technologies, fabrication techniques employed in the fields of stem cells, biomaterials and tissue engineering research including details of latest advances in nanotechnology.
Includes a description of stem cell biology with details focused on oral and craniofacial stem cells and their potential research application throughout medicine.

Concerns relating to government regulation and its impact on the practice of science
Key historical and contemporary events that have shaped our contemporary view of how science and politics intersect

	abstract = {Elaine DiMasi is a physicist and synchrotron x-ray scattering expert, and has made her career at Brookhaven National Laboratory since 1996. Research for her PhD (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) and postdoctoral appointment (BNL) focused on structure and electronic properties in metallic condensed matter systems. Since 1999 she has investigated numerous aspects of Biomineralization including: mineralization at Langmuir films, assembly and mineralization of extracellular matrix proteins, structures of organics assembled on mineral surfaces, and microbeam diffraction mapping of mineral-organic composites and biological minerals. More recent areas of interest include lipid-mineral interactions and soft X-ray microspectroscopy. DiMasi currently is engaged in building a state of the art synchrotron x-ray scattering facility at the National Synchrotorn Light Source II, dedicated to soft- and bio-materials, specializing in aqueous interfaces, providing the capabilities to measure hierarchical structures of biominerals for a wide range of length scales and in realistic material environments. 
Laurie B. Gower is an Associate Professor in the Department of Materials Science \& Engineering, and supervisor of the Biomimetics Laboratory at the University of Florida. Her Master's degree from University of Utah was in the area of Bioengineering (1990), and doctoral degree from UMASS at Amherst was in the area of Polymer Science \& Engineering (1997). In the latter case, her dissertation was focused on biomineralization, making use of model systems to examine the interactions between polypeptides and crystal growth, and correlating features observed in the in vitro systems to those observed in biominerals. Most of the research in her academic career has continued along these lines of examining potential mechanisms involved in biomineralization. She discovered a novel crystallization process that relies on a polymer-induc},

The work summarizes the cicada literature, providing a means for easy access to information previously published on a particular species or to allow researchers the ability to locate similar work that has been published on other species. A total of 2,591 references are included in the bibliography. The book is a source of biological and systematic information that could be used by zoologists, entomologists, individuals interested in crop protection, and students studying entomology as well as anyone interested in cicadas or who require specific information on the insects. Each genus/species is identified with the reference, the page number, any figures (if applicable), the topics covered by the reference, any synonymies, and any biogeographic information mentioned for the species in the individual reference. An added benefit to the catalog is that it is the first complete species list for the Cicadoidea, including all synonymies and new combinations through 2012. 
Provides nearly four times the number of references of the previous catalog, demonstrating the explosion of data since that timeContains all references found that mention a genus or species name in the workIncludes more than 300 additional references that were not in the two previous works on this subjectFeatures the first complete species list for the Cicadoidea, including all synonymies},

Oxidative stress biomarkers are very useful in assessing the health of aquatic life and more in depth studies are necessary to establish an exact cause effect relationship. Therefore, to study the effectiveness of this approach, a laboratory study was conducted in the fish Labeo rohita as a function of hexavalent chromium and the toxicity indices using a battery of oxidative stress biomarkers such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione reductase (GR) in the liver, muscle, gills, and brain have been studied along with biometric parameters, behavioral changes, and Cr bioaccumulation. A significant increased HSI was observed in contrast to CF which reduced significantly. SOD, CAT, and GR activity increased significantly in all the tissues of treated fishes. The bioaccumulation of Cr was highest in liver followed by gills, muscle, and brain. This study highlights the significance of using a set of integrated biomarker and advocate to include these parameters in National Water Quality Monitoring Program in areas potentially polluted with metals to assess the health of the ecosystem.},

The importance of ecosystems has been underestimated. We cannot simply hope ecosystems will benefit from legislation focused on other environmental and natural resource protections, such as those for wildlife, trees, air and water. An ecosystem, a community of organisms together with their physical environment, viewed as a system of interacting and interdependent relationships, has its own intricate administrative issues. Edited by Kalyani Robbins, a law professor, The Laws of Nature investigates how ecosystems function, their value to humans and wildlife, and what factors affect ecosystems' survival. This analysis is coupled with cutting-edge theories and regulatory proposals from legal scholars who study ecosystem questions. In the end, a thorough and multi-disciplinary understanding of the importance of ecosystem is presented.},

	abstract = {"In the delta, water is boss, change is the only constant, and creation and destruction exist side by side." The Peace-Athabasca Delta in northern Alberta is a globally significant wetland that lies within one of the largest unfragmented landscapes in North America. Arguably the world's largest boreal inland delta, it is renowned for its biological productivity and is a central feature of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Yet the delta and its indigenous cultures lie downstream of Alberta's bitumen sands, whose exploitation comprises one of the largest industrial projects in the world. Kevin Timoney provides an authoritative synthesis of the science and history of the delta, describing its ecology, unraveling its millennia-long history, and addressing its uncertain future. Scientists, students, leaders in the energy sector, government officials and policy makers, and conscientious citizens everywhere should read this lively work.},

This is difficult to address in the mammalian brain due to its enormous complexity, and invertebrates offer major advantages for learning and memory studies because of their relative simplicity.

Edited by two leaders in the field, "Invertebrate Learning and Memory "will offer a current and comprehensive review, with chapters authored by experts in each topic. The volume will take a multidisciplinary approach, exploring behavioral, cellular, genetic, molecular, and computational investigations of memory. Coverage will include comparative cognition at the behavioral and mechanistic level, developments in concepts and methodologies that will underlie future advancements, and mechanistic examples from the most important vertebrate systems (nematodes, molluscs, and insects). Neuroscience researchers and graduate students with an interest in the neural control of cognitive behavior will benefit, as will as will those in the field of invertebrate learning.

	abstract = {Of all vertebrates, fish exhibit unparalleled diversity of sexual plasticity and flexibility, ranging from gonochorism to unisexualism, and exceptional patterns of functional hermaphroditism. Fish farming and monosex aquaculture have led to reproductive dysfunction with males producing less milt, and females failing to ovulate and spawn. This book brings together relevant information on the role of the endocrine system on sexual differentiation in fish, and bridges the gap between molecular endocrinologists and fishery scientists.},

	abstract = {Explores new applications emerging from our latest understanding of proteins in solution and at interfaces 
Proteins in solution and at interfaces increasingly serve as the starting point for exciting new applications, from biomimetic materials to nanoparticle patterning. This book surveys the state of the science in the field, offering investigators a current understanding of the characteristics of proteins in solution and at interfaces as well as the techniques used to study these characteristics. Moreover, the authors explore many of the new and emerging applications that have resulted from the most recent studies. Topics include protein and protein aggregate structure; computational and experimental techniques to study protein structure, aggregation, and adsorption; proteins in non-standard conditions; and applications in biotechnology.

Proteins in Solution and at Interfaces is divided into two parts:


Part One introduces concepts as well as theoretical and experimental techniques that are used to study protein systems, including X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance, small angle scattering, and spectroscopic methods

Part Two examines current and emerging applications, including nanomaterials, natural fibrous proteins, and biomolecular thermodynamics
The book's twenty-three chapters have been contributed by leading experts in the field. These contributions are based on a thorough review of the latest peer-reviewed findings as well as the authors' own research experience. Chapters begin with a discussion of core concepts and then gradually build in complexity, concluding with a forecast of future developments.
Readers will not only gain a current understanding of proteins in solution and at interfaces, but also will discover how theoretical and technical developments in the field can be translated into new applications in material design, genetic engineering, personalized medicine, drug delivery, biosensors, and biotechnology.

	abstract = {During the same period in which Derek Walcott was pouring immense physical, emotional, and logistical resources into the foundation of a viable first-rate West Indian theatre company and continuing to write his inimitable poetry, he was also busy writing newspaper reviews, chiefly for the 
Trinidad Guardian. His prodigious reviewing activity extended far beyond those areas with which one might most readily associate his interests and convictions. As Gordon Rohlehr once presciently observed, "If one wants to see a quotidian workaday Walcott, one should go back to [his] well over five hundred articles, essays and reviews on painting, cinema, calypso, carnival, drama and literature," articles which "reveal a rich, various, witty and scrupulous intelligence in which generous humour counterpoints acerbity." These articles capture the vitality of Caribbean culture and shed additional light on the aesthetic preoccupations expressed in Walcott's essays published in journals. The editors have examined the corpus of Walcott's journalistic activity from its beginnings in 1950 to its peak in the early 1970s, and have made a generous selection of material from the
Guardian, along with occasional pieces from such sources as
Public Opinion (Kingston) and
The Voice of St. Lucia (Castries). The articles in Volume 2 are organized as follows: the performing arts; general surveys of anglophone Caribbean drama, theatre, and society; festivals, theatre companies, and productions; British and American drama; dance and music theatre; Carnival and calypso; and cinema screenings in Trinidad. Volume 2 additionally contains an exhaustive annotated and cross-referenced chronological bibliography of Walcott's journalism up to 1990. The co-editor Christopher Balme has written a searching introductory essay on a central theme - here, a survey of West Indian theatre and Walcott's engagement with it, particularly the idea of a 'National Theatre', coupled with an illustrative discussion of the playwright's seminal dramatic spectacle

This book examines why we deny or ignore this dependence and what we can do differently to help solve the environmental crisis. Written in an accessible and engaging style, Haydn Washington provides an excellent overview of humanity's relationship with Nature. The book looks at energy flow, nutrient cycling, ecosystem services, ecosystem collapse as well as exploring our psychological and spiritual dependency on nature. It also examines anthropocentrism and denial as causes of our unwillingness to respect our inherent dependence on the natural environment. The book concludes by bringing these issues together and providing a framework for solutions to the environmental crisis.},

By presenting a coherent interdisciplinary body of archaeological and environmental data, the volume offers an intensely deep, focused investigation of the various models of the ancient Maya political and economic systems. Research conducted over six seasons of fieldwork reveals a more centralized political system than expected and uncovers the workings of the ancient economic structure.

	abstract = {River Gomti, a tributary of river Ganga in northern India, is being polluted due to indiscriminate disposal of domestic sewage and industrial wastes that contain genotoxic chemicals. The study was conducted to evaluate the genotoxic potential of polluted water of river Gomti in two fish species, namely Channa punctatus and Mystus vittatus. The fishes were exposed in situ in nylon cages to the polluted water of river Gomti fixed near a distillery outlet located in Lucknow. The induction of DNA damage and micronuclei were determined in blood erythrocytes using comet assay and micronucleus test, respectively. The induction in micronuclei frequencies and DNA damage were found to be significantly elevated (p{\textless}0.01) in exposed specimens after 3days post-exposure as compared to the control, i.e. from laboratory-acclimatized fish specimens. The comparison of DNA damage between the two species indicated that C. punctatus is more sensitive to aquatic pollutants. Thus, this fish could be used as a bio-indicator of genotoxicity for bio-monitoring of water bodies. The results further revealed that the river Gomti is being contaminated with potential genotoxic and mutagenic chemicals produced from industrial and domestic activities; therefore, immediate measures are needed to reduce the inflow of pollutants in the river.},

	abstract = {Fish collected after a mass mortality at an artificial lake in south-east Queensland, Australia, were examined for the presence of nodularin as the lake had earlier been affected by a Nodularia bloom. Methanol extracts of muscle, liver, peritoneal and stomach contents were analysed by HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry; histological examination was conducted on livers from captured mullet. Livers of sea mullet (Mugil cephalus) involved in the fish kill contained high concentrations of nodularin (median 43.6 mg/kg, range 40.8-47.8 mg/kg dry weight; n = 3) and the toxin was also present in muscle tissue (median 44.0 µg/kg, range 32.3-56.8 µg/kg dry weight). Livers of fish occupying higher trophic levels accumulated much lower concentrations. Mullet captured from the lake 10 months later were also found to have high hepatic nodularin levels. DNA sequencing of mullet specimens revealed two species inhabiting the study lake: M. cephalus and an unidentified mugilid. The two mullet species appear to differ in their exposure and/or uptake of nodularin, with M. cephalus demonstrating higher tissue concentrations. The feeding ecology of mullet would appear to explain the unusual capacity of these fish to concentrate nodularin in their livers; these findings may have public health implications for mullet fisheries and aquaculture production where toxic cyanobacteria blooms affect source waters. This report incorporates a systematic review of the literature on nodularin measured in edible fish, shellfish and crustaceans. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {With BPA in baby bottles, mercury in fish, and lead in computer monitors, the world has become a toxic place. But as Emily Monosson demonstrates in her groundbreaking new book, it has always been toxic. When oxygen first developed in Earth's atmosphere, it threatened the very existence of life: now we literally can't live without it. According to Monosson, examining how life adapted to such early threats can teach us a great deal about today's (and tomorrow's) most dangerous contaminants. While the study of evolution has advanced many other sciences, from conservation biology to medicine, the field of toxicology has yet to embrace this critical approach.

In
Evolution in a Toxic World, Monosson seeks to change that. She traces the development of life's defense systems--the mechanisms that transform, excrete, and stow away potentially harmful chemicals--from more than three billion years ago to today. Beginning with our earliest ancestors' response to ultraviolet radiation, Monosson explores the evolution of chemical defenses such as antioxidants, metal binding proteins, detoxification, and cell death.

As we alter the world's chemistry, these defenses often become overwhelmed faster than our bodies can adapt. But studying how our complex internal defense network currently operates, and how it came to be that way, may allow us to predict how it will react to novel and existing chemicals. This understanding could lead to not only better management and preventative measures, but possibly treatment of current diseases. Development of that knowledge starts with this pioneering book.

However, the latest generation of molecular methods, using many genes, expressed sequence tags, and even whole genomes, has brought a new stability to the field. For the first time this book brings together theinformation from these varied fields, and demonstrates that it is indeed now possible to build a phylogenetic tree from a combination of both morphology and gene sequences.This thoroughly revised third edition of Animal Evolution brings the subject fully up to date, especially in light of the latest advances in molecular techniques. The book is generously illustrated throughout with finely detailed line drawings and clear diagrams, many of them new.},

In honor of Darwin's birthday, the National Research Council appointed a committee under the auspices of the U.S. National Committee (USNC) for DIVERSITAS to plan a Symposium on Twenty-first Century Ecosystems. The purpose of the symposium was to capture some of the current excitement and recent progress in scientific understanding of ecosystems, from the microbial to the global level, while also highlighting how improved understanding can be applied to important policy issues that have broad biodiversity and ecosystem effects. The aim was to help inform new policy approaches that could satisfy human needs while also maintaining the integrity of the goods and services provided by biodiversity and ecosystems over both the short and the long terms. 
This report summarizes the views expressed by symposium participants; however, it does not provide a session-by-session summary of the presentations at the symposium. Instead, the symposium steering committee identified eight key themes that emerged from the lectures, which were addressed in different contexts by different speakers. The focus here is on general principles rather than specifics. These eight themes provide a sharp focus on a few concepts that enable scientists, environmental NGOs, and policy makers to engage more effectively around issues of central importance for biodiversity and ecosystem management.

	abstract = {Background 
Bivalves are very ancient and successful conchiferan mollusks (both in terms of species number and geographical distribution). Despite their importance in marine biota, their deep phylogenetic relationships were scarcely investigated from a molecular perspective, whereas much valuable work has been done on taxonomy, as well as phylogeny, of lower taxa.
Methodology/Principal Findings
Here we present a class-level bivalve phylogeny with a broad sample of 122 ingroup taxa, using four mitochondrial markers (MT-RNR1, MT-RNR2, MT-CO1, MT-CYB). Rigorous techniques have been exploited to set up the dataset, analyze phylogenetic signal, and infer a single final tree. In this study, we show the basal position of Opponobranchia to all Autobranchia, as well as of Palaeoheterodonta to the remaining Autobranchia, which we here propose to call Amarsipobranchia. Anomalodesmata were retrieved as monophyletic and basal to (Heterodonta + Pteriomorphia).
Conclusions/Significance
Bivalve morphological characters were traced onto the phylogenetic trees obtained from the molecular analysis; our analysis suggests that eulamellibranch gills and heterodont hinge are ancestral characters for all Autobranchia. This conclusion would entail a re-evaluation of bivalve symplesiomorphies.},

	abstract = {The contemporary animal rights movement encompasses a wide range of sometimes-competing agendas from vegetarianism to animal liberation. For people for whom pets are family members--animal lovers outside the fray--extremist positions in which all human-animal interaction is suspect often discourage involvement in the movement to end cruelty to other beings. In Loving Animals, Kathy Rudy argues that in order to achieve such goals as ending animal testing and factory farming, activists need to be better attuned to the profound emotional, even spiritual, attachment that many people have with the animals in their lives. Offering an alternative to both the acceptance of animal exploitation and radical animal liberation, Rudy shows that a deeper understanding of the nature of our feelings for and about animals can redefine the human-animal relationship in a positive way. Through extended interviews with people whose lives are intertwined with animals, analysis of the cultural representation of animals, and engaging personal accounts, she explores five realms in which humans use animals: as pets, for food, in entertainment, in scientific research, and for clothing. In each case she presents new methods of animal advocacy to reach a more balanced and sustainable relationship association built on reciprocity and connection. Using this intense emotional bond as her foundation, Rudy suggests that the nearly universal stories we tell of living with and loving animals will both broaden the support for animal advocacy and inspire the societal changes that will improve the lives of animals--and humans--everywhere.},

Another theory revolves around the timing of the invasion of rainbow smelt to the lake in the early 1990s coinciding with increases in pickerel production. Rainbow smelt are small fish that graze on tiny organisms. It's unknown to what extent rainbow smelt has affected pickerel production in the lake and whether rainbow smelt comprises a significant part of the pickerel diet, particularly in the lake's north basin.},

	abstract = {Ant colony optimization is a population-based general-search technique that can be used for the solution of difficult combinatorial problems. Ant colony optimization uses the knowledge-reinforcing mechanism used by real-life ants while traversing possible paths in search of food, depositing a chemical substance (called pheromone), en-route and subsequently forming trails which can then be followed by other ants in the colony. With its strong mathematical foundation and its simplicity of use, ant colony optimization provides an alternative method to routing optimizations with a wide range of applications. This book presents topical research in the study of ant colonies, their behavior and application in computer technologies.},

The field of water and wastewater microbiology has advanced dramatically in recent years, spurred by growing awareness about health and environmental impacts. These advances have been thoroughly integrated into the Fourth Edition of
Wastewater Microbiology, widely regarded as the field's definitive text reference. In this
Fourth Edition, the book focuses more exclusively on issues particular to wastewater--microbial contaminants found in wastewater, methods of detection for these contaminants, methods of cleansing wastewater of microbial contamination, and the health effects of microbial contamination--with new information on fecal contamination and new molecular methods.
The many advances in wastewater microbiology have all been thoroughly integrated into this text, including:


A new chapter on microbial source tracking of fecal contamination of receiving waters

Recent information on disinfection methods such as UV disinfection and photoreactivation, solar radiation, photocatalysis, ultrasonic energy, ultra-high hydrostatic pressure, membrane filtration, and the use of nanomaterials

New methods for determining cell viability/activity in environmental samples

An expanded section on molecular methods

A new section on bacterial spores as indicators

Advances in the study of the activated sludge system as well as an expanded section on Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) in activated sludge

A new section on bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment, which is based on the use of microorganisms for the production of bioelectricity
In addition, the text includes updated content on risk assessment, methanogen classification, and methodology and inhibition of anaerobic digestion. Information concerning the growing fields of epidemiology and public health microbiology has been similarly expanded.
Complete with end-of-chapter questions, this is the single go-to reference in wastewater microbiology for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and professionals in sciences and engineering in the fields of microbiology and environmental/wastewater engineering and treatment, as well as for public health officials.

In order to assess the potential role of macroinvertebrates in VHSV transmission, Diporeia  spp., a group of amphipods that are preyed upon by a number of susceptible Great Lakes fishes, were collected from seven locations in four of the Great Lakes and analyzed for the presence of VHSV. It was demonstrated that VHSV is present in some Diporeia  spp. samples collected from lakes Ontario, Huron, and Michigan, but not from Lake Superior. Phylogenetic comparison of partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences (737 base pairs) of the five isolates to sequences of 13 other VHSV strains showed the clustering of Diporeia  spp. isolates with the VHSV genotype IVb. This study reports the first incidence of a fish-pathogenic rhabdovirus being isolated from Diporeia , or any other crustacean and underscores the role macroinvertebrates may play in VHSV ecology.},

	abstract = {Animals in complex human societies are often both meal and symbol, related to everyday practice and ritual. People in such societies may be characterized as having unequal access to such resources, or else the meaning of animals may differ for component groups. Here, in this book, 28 peer-reviewed papers that span 4 continents and the Caribbean islands explore in different ways how animals were incorporated into the diets and religions of many unique societies. The temporal range is from the Neolithic to the Spanish colonization of the New World as well as to modern tourist trade in indigenous animal art. The volume explores various themes including the interaction of foodways with complex societies, the interaction between diet and colonialism and the complex role that animals, and parts of animals, play in all human societies as religious, identity markers, or other types of symbols. Organized according to these themes, rather than geographic location or time period, the papers presented here crosscut such divisions. In so doing, this book presents an opportunity for scholars divided by geography especially, but also by temporal period, to explore each other's research and demonstrate that different archaeological settings can address the same problems cross-culturally.},

	abstract = {The story of how diesel engines and gas turbines, used to power cargo ships and jet airplanes, made today's globally integrated economy possible. 
The many books on globalization published over the past few years range from claims that the world is flat to an unlikely rehabilitation of Genghis Khan as a pioneer of global commerce. Missing from these accounts is a consideration of the technologies behind the creation of the globalized economy. What makes it possible for us to move billions of tons of raw materials and manufactured goods from continent to continent? Why are we able to fly almost anywhere on the planet within twenty-four hours? In
Prime Movers of Globalization, Vaclav Smil offers a history of two key technical developments that have driven globalization: the high-compression non-sparking internal combustion engines invented by Rudolf Diesel in the 1890s and the gas turbines designed by Frank Whittle and Hans-Joachim Pabst von Ohain in the 1930s. The massive diesel engines that power cargo ships and the gas turbines that propel jet engines, Smil argues, are more important to the global economy than any corporate structure or international trade agreement. Smil compares the efficiency and scale of these two technologies to prime movers of the past, including the sail and the steam engine. The lengthy processes of development, commercialization, and diffusion that the diesel engine and the gas turbine went through, he argues, provide perfect examples of gradual technical advances that receive little attention but have resulted in epochal shifts in global affairs and the global economy.},

Moving through all five boroughs, neighborhood by neighborhood, it offers the most complete overview of New York's significant places, past and present. The Fifth Edition continues to include places of historical importance--including extensive coverage of the World Trade Center site--while also taking full account of the construction boom of the past 10 years, a boom that has given rise to an unprecedented number of new buildings by such architects as Frank Gehry, Norman Foster, and Renzo Piano. All of the buildings included in the Fourth Edition have been revisited and re-photographed and much of the commentary has been re-written, and coverage of the outer boroughs--particularly Brooklyn--has been expanded.Famed skyscrapers and historic landmarks are detailed, but so, too, are firehouses, parks, churches, parking garages, monuments, and bridges. Boasting more than 3000 new photographs, 100 enhanced maps, and thousands of short and spirited entries, the guide is arranged geographically by borough, with each borough divided into sectors and then into neighborhood. Extensive commentaries describe the character of the divisions.Knowledgeable, playful, and beautifully illustrated, here is the ultimate guided tour of New York's architectural treasures.Acclaim for earlier editions of the AIA Guide to New York City:"An extraordinarily learned, personable exegesis of our metropolis. No other American or, for that matter, world city can boast so definitive a one-volume guide to its built environment."-- Philip Lopate, New York Times"Blithe in spirit and unerring in vision."-- New York Magazine"A definitive record of New York's architectural heritage... witty and helpful pocketful which serves as arbiter of architects, Baedeker for boulevardiers, catalog for the curious, primer for preservationists, and sourcebook to students. For all who seek to know of New York, it is here. No home should be without a copy."-- Municipal Art Society"There are two reasons the guide has entered the pantheon of New York books. One is its encyclopedic nature, and the other is its inimitable style--'smart, vivid, funny and opinionated' as the architectural historian Christopher Gray once summed it up in pithy W \& W fashion."-- Constance Rosenblum, New York Times"A book for architectural gourmands and gastronomic gourmets."-- The Village Voice},

	abstract = {Teaching for Student Learning: Becoming an Accomplished Teacher shows teachers how to move from novice to expert status by integrating both research and the wisdom of practice into their teaching. It emphasizes how accomplished teachers gradually acquire and apply a broad repertoire of evidence-based teaching practices in the support of student learning. The book's content stems from three major fields of study: 1) theories and research on how people learn, including new insights from the cognitive and neurosciences; 2) research on classroom practices shown to have the greatest effect on student learning; and 3) research on effective schooling, defined as school-level factors that enhance student achievement and success. Although the book's major focus is on teaching, it devotes considerable space to describing how students learn and how the most effective and widely-used models of teaching connect to principles of student learning. Specifically, it describes how research on teaching, cognition, and neuroscience converge to provide an evidence-based "science of learning" which teachers can use to advance their practice. Key features include the following: Evidence-Based Practice - This theme is developed through: 1) an ongoing review and synthesis of research on teaching and learning and the resulting guidelines for practice and 2) boxed research summaries within the chapters. Instructional Repertoire Theme - Throughout the book teaching is viewed as an extremely complex activity that requires a repertoire of instructional strategies that, once mastered, can be drawn upon to fit specific classrooms and teaching situations. Standards-based School Environments - Education today is dominated by standards-based school environments. Unlike competing books, this one describes these environments and shows how they impact curriculum design and learning activities. The objective is to show how teachers can make standards-based education work for them. Pedagogical Features - In addition to an end-of-book glossary, each chapter contains research boxes, reflection boxes, itemized end-of-chapter summaries, and end-of-chapter learning activities. Website - An accompanying website contains a variety of field-oriented and site-based activities that teachers can do alone or with colleagues.},

	doi = {10.4081/jlimnol.2010.174},
	abstract = {This paper illustrates the results of an analysis performed on historical data of the main meteorological and water quality variables collected during the last fifty years in the basin of Lake Trasimeno, a shallow lake subjected to important water level fluctuations. The results reveal a significant increase of the annual mean of minimum and maximum air temperature, water temperature and solar radiation, and a significant reduction of precipitation and cloud cover, which have mostly occurred during the last twenty years. The decadal rate of warming observed in the last twenty years for air temperature (0.33 °C decade-1) is consistent with the estimate reported by the IPCC for the land-surface temperature in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the surface water temperature in Lake Trasimeno shows a more marked increase (0.65 °C decade-1), comparable to that observed in other lakes of Mediterranean areas. On a monthly scale, the most significant variations are observed in late-spring and early summer months for temperature and solar irradiation, and in winter and spring months for rainfall, which result in an appreciable modification of the seasonal progression. The alterations of the thermal and hydrological balance of the lake have caused a progressive lowering of the water level and the emergence of evaporative conditions. As a consequence of the drought, a progressive accumulation of dissolved salts (3.5 106 kg y-1) is observed, which is partially explained by meteoric loading. The analysis also shows that an increase in the total alkalinity has occurred during the main drought phases of the last forty years, which has been shown to be consistent with what expected on the basis of the changes in the ionic composition of the waters. With decreasing water levels, a strong reduction in water transparency has also been observed, which does not appear to be connected with a change in the trophic state of the lake, but rather with the increase of suspended solids from bottom sediments, in agreement with the predictions based on resuspension models in shallow waters. On putting the results into the future scenario of climate change, an accelerating drought and progressive worsening of the water quality can be predicted for Lake Trasimeno in the near future.},

"The problem of course is when the algae grows along the shore it detaches, washes up on the shore and causes a significant decline in the use of the shore."  


The province managed to curb algae growth by cutting down on phosphorus in detergents and reducing phosphorus at wastewater treatment plants.


"In the late 1990s algae growth did start to increase and we now, of course, truly have problem conditions again," Moore said.},

	abstract = {Both by definition and by scope, ecotoxicology is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary science combining the disciplines of chemistry, biochemistry, toxicology, and ecology. Modeling is also increasingly used by ecotoxicologists to better understand the effects and fate of chemicals in the different compartments of the biosphere and to simulate them in the frame of predictive hazard and risk assessment schemes. 
Ecotoxicology Modeling is a comprehensive and well-documented text providing a collection of computational methods to the ecotoxicologists primarily interested in the study of the adverse effects of chemicals, their mechanisms of action and/or their environmental fate and behavior. Avoiding mathematical jargon, the book presents numerous case studies to enable the reader to understand the interest but also the limitations of linear and nonlinear models in ecotoxicology.
Written by an international team of scientists, Ecotoxicology Modeling is of primary interest to those whose research or professional activity is directly concerned with the development and application of models in ecotoxicology. It is also intended to provide the graduate and post-graduate students with a clear and accessible text covering the main types of modeling approaches used in environmental sciences.},

	abstract = {The situation of the Aral Sea is known as one of the worst man-made environmental crises of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Many have seen the satellite photos evidencing the startling shrinkage and deterioration of the sea, as it was a few decades ago and how it appears today. Whereas the Aral Sea was the world's fourth-largest inland body of water in 1960, it has now shrunk to a small fraction of that within three increasingly saline and polluted parts, primarily due to the diversion of waters for agricultural irrigation. The Aral Sea Encyclopedia is devoted to the remarkable phenomenon of the possibility of Aral Sea's imminent disappearance from the Earth in the time span of a single human generation. 
It first describes the sea before it started drying-out, and then the actions and efforts of the Central Asian countries, as well as the international community, to mitigate the socioeconomic and environmental hazards caused by this desiccation and increasing salinity. This comprehensive reference not only addresses the key environmental issues and presents national and international programs. It also documents the history of the related research studies, the involvement of prominent historical figures, and the chronology of events over three centuries, which became the milestones in the economic development of the Aral Sea and its subsequent diminution.
The publication of the Aral Sea Encyclopedia initiates a group of similar valuable references that gather multi-disciplinary perspectives on the world's seas, including planned volumes on the Caspian and Black Seas and the Sea of Japan.First volume of Springer Series on encyclopaedias of the seas Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras},

	abstract = {The Earth's biodiversity-the rich variety of life on our planet-is disappearing at an alarming rate. And while many books have focused on the expected ecological consequences, or on the aesthetic, ethical, sociological, or economic dimensions of this loss, Sustaining Life is the first book to examine the full range of potential threats that diminishing biodiversity poses to human health. Edited and written by Harvard Medical School physicians Eric Chivian and Aaron Bernstein, along with more than 100 leading scientists who contributed to writing and reviewing the book, Sustaining Life presents a comprehensive--and sobering--view of how human medicines, biomedical research, the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, and the production of food, both on land and in the oceans, depend on biodiversity. The book's ten chapters cover everything from what biodiversity is and how human activity threatens it to how we as individuals can help conserve the world's richly varied biota. Seven groups of organisms, some of the most endangered on Earth, provide detailed case studies to illustrate the contributions they have already made to human medicine, and those they are expected to make if we do not drive them to extinction. Drawing on the latest research, but written in language a general reader can easily follow, Sustaining Life argues that we can no longer see ourselves as separate from the natural world, nor assume that we will not be harmed by its alteration. Our health, as the authors so vividly show, depends on the health of other species and on the vitality of natural ecosystems. With a foreword by E.O. Wilson and a prologue by Kofi Annan, and more than 200 poignant color illustrations, Sustaining Life contributes essential perspective to the debate over how humans affect biodiversity and a compelling demonstration of the human health costs.

	abstract = {Valve closure behavior in freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea is a biologically sensitive endpoint. The purpose of this paper was to derive an electrophysiological response model of C. fluminea to assess copper (Cu)-sodium (Na) interactions in gill membrane, whereby valve closure behavior and Cu toxicity could be monitored. The proposed model was based on the integration of Cu bioavailability, Na and Cu internalizations, and electrochemically-based gill potentials. Based on Na active transport under non-equilibrium conditions, predicted gill potential of -8.2 mV agreed reasonably well with published the measured transepithelial potential of -7 mV in C. fluminea. Our proposed framework captured the general features observed in model applications including: (i) 50\% inhibitory Cu2+ activities for Na membrane potential (ENa) and uptake rate (JNa) were estimated to be 0.072 and 0.043 mM, respectively, with a stoichiometry of 3Cu2+: 1ENa and 1JNa; (ii) the external Cu2+-dependent internal Na concentration could be parsimoniously estimated, and (iii) the site-specific clam gill potentials could be monitored. Here we provided a new approach to monitor waterborne metal toxicity to reduce the nationwide economic losses due to bans on harvesting of contaminated clam and the potential risks to the health of clams.},

Thereafter, since many fishes live in detrimental environments, mainly induced by the continuous input of xenobiotic substances into waterways, the authors found it highly pertinent to include this topic.

	abstract = {Fish -- including cyclostomes, elasmobranchs, and teleosts -- display a wide variety of ways of coping with the stringent conditions they encounter in the aquatic environment. This diversity is especially evident in the female genital systems where some fish spawn profligate numbers of small eggs while others develop a few yolky eggs that may receive parental care. Parental care is carried to extremes in viviparity where eggs develop within the ovary or oviducts of the mother. 
This volume describes the myriad ways in which fish have approached problems of reproduction -- it is an amply illustrated comparative study of the microscopic structure of the female genital systems of fish. The timing of its appearance is auspicious in that it coincides with the decline of the golden age of descriptive morphology. It is a compilation of thousands of micrographs -- mostly electron micrographs -- from classic works in the field and should prove valuable to investigators studying fish in areas such as ecology, physiology, and reproductive biology who may view histology as essential in their work but have little background in this area. It includes chapters on the origin of genital systems, the structure of ovarian follicles, mechanisms of ovulation, the cortical reaction, oviducts, oviparity, and amazing examples of viviparity.

	abstract = {Biology is often viewed today as a bipartisan field, with molecular level genetics guiding us into the future and natural history (including ecology, evolution, and conservation biology,) chaining us to a descriptive scientific past. In Darwinian Detectives, Norman Johnson bridges this divide, revealing how the tried and true tools of natural history make sense of the newest genomic discoveries. Molecular scientists exploring newly sequenced genomes have stumbled upon quite a few surprises, including that only one to ten percent of the genetic material of animals actually codes for genes. What does the remaining 90-99\% of the genome do? Why do some organisms have a much lower genome size than their close relatives? What were the genetic changes that were associated with us becoming human? As molecular biologists uncover these and other new mysteries, evolutionary geneticists are searching for answers to such questions. Norman Johnson captures the excitement of the hunt for our own genetic history. Through lively anecdotes, he explores how researchers detect natural selection acting on genes and what this genetic information tells us about human origins.},

This report provides evidence for the decline of some pollinator species in North America, including America's most important managed pollinator, the honey bee, as well as some butterflies, bats, and hummingbirds. For most managed and wild pollinator species, however, population trends have not been assessed because populations have not been monitored over time. In addition, for wild species with demonstrated declines, it is often difficult to determine the causes or consequences of their decline. This report outlines priorities for research and monitoring that are needed to improve information on the status of pollinators and establishes a framework for conservation and restoration of pollinator species and communities.

The leading research paradigm can be synthesized in 'phenomenology to neurons to stimuli, and backwards', since as a starting point it has taken the phenomenal appearances in the visual field. Specifically, the leading theme of the volume is the co-presence and interaction of diverse types of spaces in vision, like the optical space of psychophysics and of neural elaboration, the qualitative space of phenomenal appearances, and its relation with the pictorial space of art. The contributors to the volume agree in arguing that those spaces follow different rules of organization, whose specific singularity and reciprocal dependence have to be individuated, as a preliminary step to understand the architecture of the conscious awareness of our environment and to conceive its potential implementation in constructing any kind of embodied intentional agents.

Against current orthodoxy, Barker develops a strong case for the development of agricultural systems in many areas as transformations in the life-ways of the indigenous forager societies, and argues that these were as much changes in social norms and ideologies as in ways of obtaining food.

Mockingbird Song, Jack Temple Kirby offers a personal and passionate recounting of the centuries-old human-nature relationship in the South. Exhibiting violent cycles of growth, abandonment, dereliction, resettlement, and reconfiguration, this relationship, Kirby suggests, has the sometimes melodious, sometimes cacophonous vocalizations of the region's emblematic avian, the mockingbird.



In a narrative voice marked by the intimacy and enthusiasm of a storyteller, Kirby explores all of the South's peoples and their landscapes--how humans have used, yielded, or manipulated varying environments and how they have treated forests, water, and animals. Citing history, literature, and cinematic portrayals along the way, Kirby also relates how southerners have thought about their part of Earth--as a source of both sustenance and delight.},

Designed as a text for intermediate to advanced students, this book utilizes numerous illustrations and an extensive literature base to impart the current state-of-the-art knowledge in this field. While many of the existing books in estuarine science are comprised of edited volumes, typically focused on highly specific topics in estuaries,Biogeochemistry of Estuaries provides, for the first time, a unique foundation in the areas of geomorphology, geochemistry, biochemistry, aqueous chemistry, and ecology, while making strong linkages (trhoughout the text) to ecosystem-based processes in estuarine sciences. Estuaries, located at the interface between land and the coastal ocean are dynamic, highly productive systems that, in many cases, have been historically associated with development of many of the great centers of early human civilization. Consequentially, these systems have and continue to be highly impacted by anthropogenic inputs. This timely book takes the foundational basis of elemental cycling in estuarine and applies it to estuarine management issues. Biogeochemistry of Estuaries will be welcomed by estuarine/marine scientists, ecologists, biogeochemists, and environmentalists around the world.},

	abstract = {Microbiologists are being challenged as foodborne outbreaks are increasingly being observed worldwide. Most of these outbreaks are associated with viral and bacterial pathogens such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, and lately Escherichia coli O157:H7, which emerged in the 1990s. Although parasites have been evolving with Man since antiquity, the control and eradication of these diseases are still far from being achieved. They are more frequently being reported in the literature as causative agents of food and waterborne illnesses. 
Foodborne Parasites examines the two major parasite groups that are transmitted via water or foods: the protozoa, which are single celled organisms, and the helminths. The helminths are classified in three sub groups: cestodes (tapeworms), nematodes (round worms), and trematodes (flukes). To better understand their significance, each chapter covers the biology, mechanisms of pathogenesis, epidemiology, treatment, and inactivation of these parasites.
This important new text is crucial to a better understanding of the biology and control of parasitic infections necessary to reduce and eliminate future outbreaks in the U.S. and elsewhere.Serves as a reference book for students and professionals in food science as well as public health Reviews the two major parasite groups that are transmitted via water or foods: the protozoa and the helminths Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras},

JIM PETTY, Regional Science Program Manager, US Geological Survey (GS) Central Region BRD, received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1975 from the University of Missouri-Columbia. Prior to assuming his current regional role, Dr. Petty conducted and directed research in all aspects of environmental chemistry from the development of analytical methods for emerging contaminants of concern and the identification of unknown contaminants to fate studies to better define the bioavailability/bioconcentration of contaminants and their potential adverse effects on organisms. Furthermore, he has developed and applied systems and approaches for ensuring science quality. Dr. Petty has served as the Chief, Environmental Chemistry Branch, USGS''s Columbia Environmental Research Center; Director of Analytical Research at the Fermenta Animal Health Company; he was the Chief of the Quality Assurance Branch of the US Environmental Protection Agency¢ s Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory-Las Vegas; and the Chief Chemist of the US Fish and Wildlife Service''s National Fisheries Contaminant Research Center. Dr. Petty is an adjunct professor of chemistry and member of the doctoral faculty of the University of Missouri-Columbia and has directed the thesis research of two doctoral students and one masters student. He has authored or co-authored more than 100 peer-reviewed publications, numerous presentations at scientific meetings, and six U.S. Government patents covering a wide array of research topics.


JAMES HUCKINS began his career rather abruptly after being drafted into the US Army''s Chemical Corps, while enrolled in geochemistry graduate school at the University of Missouri at Rolla. Afterwards, he was employed as an analytical methods chemist by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service''s (F\&WS) Fish Pesticide Research Laboratory. During this period he developed or co-developed a number of widely used analytical methods for organic contaminants and his research enabled the selective separation of toxic planar halogenated aromatic compounds from environmental matrices. Then his research interest broadened to include environmental chemistry and he served as leader of the Fate of the Chemical Section at the F\&WS''s/National Biological Survey''s National Fisheries Contaminant Research Center. More recently, he has served as leader of the Chemical Fate and Dynamics Section of the US Geological Survey''s Columbia Environmental Research Center. He is the author or co-author of four US Government Patents on passive sampling (including SPMDs) and five other US Government Patents related to chromatographic systems. During his career he has authored or co-authored about 90 peer-reviewed articles/publications and has received more than 15 awards for his research. These awards include the US Department of Interior''s meritorious Service Award and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry''s Government Service Award for his pioneering research on passive sampling technologies.


KEES BOOIJ was educated as a physical chemist and chemical technologist. He obtained his PhD in chemical oceanography in 1989 at the University of Groningen (The Netherlands) on solute exchange between sediment and water. Since 1989 he was employed as a scientist at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, working on the fate of organic contaminants in the marine environment. After some initial unsatisfactory experiences with batch extraction techniques for determining dissolved organic contaminant concentrations in sea water, he became interested in the evaluation of semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) for determining dissolved contaminants in both sea water and air. Early on he recognized the importance of boundary layers in exchange processes related to passive samplers. In a seminal paper on SPMDs, he demonstrated the dramatic effects on SPMD sampling rates of significant difference in facial flow velocities and highlighted methodology to account for this environmental variable. Over the past few years, his main interest has been to model the basic processes that govern the kinetics of solute exchange between passive samplers and water/air, aiming to strengthen passive sampling technology as a practical tool for contaminant fate assessment. He has authored or co-authored 25 publications in the peer-reviewed literature.},

The explosion of information at the cellular level, made possible in part by the continued emergence of powerful molecular and cellular techniques, has resulted in a greater degree of revision than that of any other edition. The first section, now titled Basic Cell Physiology and Growth of the Gl Tract contains numerous new chapters on topics such as transcriptional regulation, signaling networks in development, apoptosis, and mechanisms in malignancies. Most of the chapters in this section were edited by Juanita L. Merchant. Section II has been renamed Neural Gastroenterology and Motility and has been expanded from seven chapters with rather classic titles to more than twenty chapters encompassing not only the movement of the various parts of the digestive tract but also cell physiology, neural regulation, stress, and the regulation of food intake. Almost all of the chapters were recruited and edited by Jackie D. Wood. The third section is entirely new and contains chapters on Immunology and Inflammation which were edited by Kim E. Barrett. The fourth section on the Physiology of Secretion consists of chapters with familiar titles, but with completely updated information to reflect the advances in our understanding of the cellular processes involved in secretion. The last section on Digestion and Absorption contains new chapters on the intestinal barrier, protein sorting and ion channels along with those focusing on the uptake of specific nutrients. These chapters were recruited and edited by Hamid M. Said and Fayez K. Ghishan.

	abstract = {This book examines recent research into the molecular biology, genomics and transcriptomics of, and novel control strategies for, flatworm parasites. These include Cestodes (tapeworms) and Trematodes (flukes, schistosomes etc), which are the cause of a number of diseases of medical and veterinary importance. The book explores three main areas: phylogeny, genetics and transcriptomes; immunobiology, host-parasite interaction and control; and protein function, metabolism and physiology. Where appropriate, comparisons are made between different parasitic flatworms and between parasitic and free-living species. The book concludes by exploring future avenues for research. Contributors to the book include leading authorities from Europe, North and South America, and Australia.},

	abstract = {A brilliant writer and gifted big picture thinker, David Ehrenfeld is one of America's leading conservation biologists. Becoming Good Ancestors unites in a single, up-to-date framework pieces written over two decades, spanning politics, ecology, and culture, and illuminating the forces in modern society that thwart our efforts to solve today's hard questions about society and the environment. The book focuses on our present-day retreat from reality, our alienation from nature, our unthinking acceptance of new technology and rejection of the old, the loss of our ability to discriminate between events we can control and those we cannot, the denial of non-economic values, and the decline of local communities. If we are aware of what we are losing and why we are losing it, the author notes, all of these patterns are reversible. Through down-to-earth examples, ranging from a family canoe trip in the wilderness to the novels of Jane Austen to Chinese turtle and tiger farms, Ehrenfeld shows how we can use what we learn to move ourselves and our society towards a more stable, less frantic, and far more satisfying life, a life in which we are no longer compelled to damage ourselves and our environment, in which our children have a future, and in which fewer species are endangered and more rivers run clean. In the final chapter, he offers a dramatic view of the possibilities inherent in a fusion of the best elements of conservatism and liberalism. Our society has an inherent sense of what is right, says Ehrenfeld, and the creativity and persistence to make good things happen. It is now time to apply our intelligence, guided by our moral judgment, to the very large problems we all face. This book is an important first step.},

If you're still reading this (and thank you for hanging in) and are hoping, or expecting, for a miracle cure to the latest species invasion problem, sorry, I haven't got one. Nor does anybody else. Each situation is unique and needs its own solution. There is no magic book of impact-free management techniques for wildlife species that step outside their supposed bounds.


To truly manage a species is almost impossible, as every species is connected to many other species. The type of soil, the amount of water and the range of temperature dictates what kinds of plants will grow in an area; the type of plants that grow will sustain certain species of herbivores; the population size of herbivores will limit how many predators can survive here; and the wealth and pressure of developers (who are serving the needs of people in general) will determine how quickly all of the above is impacted upon, altered or even trashed.},

In 1999, sport and commercial fisherman agreed to an MNR five year rehabilitation plan to restore walleye, perch and other fish populations in the lake. Walleye increased in the western end of the lake but not the eastern end, where walleye from the Grand River tend to live. Some walleye from the western end do migrate into this district but in small numbers.


After the meeting, [Rob Culp], who is president of the Dunnville District Hunters and Anglers Club voiced his disappointment about the walleye cap. This year's quota equals last year's harvest, he said. If walleye caps set five years ago were not loosened up too soon, stock could have rebounded, he said. Based on past experience, he hoped the industry and ministry learned and will react more quickly to fish stock drops.},

	abstract = {He said authorities should look at all options to fix the problem, even drastic ones such as closing the Welland Canal, which allows access from Lake Ontario to the upper Great Lakes by ocean- going ships. The closure would surely cause economic, trade and logistical problems, but it would eliminate the spread of invasive species in all of the Great Lakes except Ontario, [Gary Fahnenstiel] said.


Fahnenstiel said he would support a proposal by some Canadian scientists to stop transatlantic shipping at Montreal and have loads transferred to Great Lakes ships. That would lead to an environmental solution - and full use of the underutilized Great Lakes fleet - without closing the canal, he said.


Since the 1830s, the Great Lakes have been invaded by many species. The sea lamprey decimated lake trout in several of the lakes by the 1940s. When the St. Lawrence Seaway was opened in 1959, ocean-going vessels brought more foreign species in their ballast holds.},

The book analyzes important new discoveries that have occurred recently and examines evidence that is not available elsewhere. Cameron and Groves argue that the existing evidence supports a recent origin for modern humans from Africa.

Currently, ocean-going vessels are  the No. 1 source of aquatic invasive species, which are completely  destroying the Great Lakes," says Nalbone.                 Another idea is to get smaller ships running on the seaway, taking  containers from ocean-going vessels in ports like Halifax and  Montreal, and bringing them to Great Lakes ports. That would have  the added benefit of keeping invasive species out of the Great Lakes.},

This book identifies the flaws in its application, which often have been swept under the carpet by those involved in the initiatives. The authors analyse them, and propose remedies for specific circumstances based on the lessons learned from CBNRM experience in southern Africa over more than a decade. The result is essential reading for all researchers, observers and practitioners who have focused on CBNRM in sustainable development programmes as a means to overcome poverty and conserve ecosystems in various parts of the globe. It is a vital tool in improving their methods and performance.

	abstract = {A charismatic naturalist, bird-watcher, teacher, artist, photographer, film-maker, and winner of the Nobel Prize, Niko Tinbergen was a prominent and influential scientist. Jointly with Konrad Lorenz, he laid the foundation for a new science, the biological study of animal behaviour. 'Ethology', and his talent for devising behaviour-testing experiments, provided an outlet for Niko's enthusiasm for gulls and sticklebacks, snow-buntings and foxes, wasps and falcons, andeven children.This first full-length biography of Niko Tinbergen, lavishly illustrated with many of Niko's own drawings, describes his background in Holland, a naturalists' paradise, and the beginnings of his investigations into the behaviour of birds, fish, and insects. Hans Kruuk also explores is Niko's relationship with his colleague and co-Nobelist Konrad Lorenz. These were two men full of contrasts: Niko a charming, self-effacing field man and experimenter; Konrad a flamboyant and egocentric German,always full of new ideas. Niko's Nature goes on to follow Niko's progress in Oxford after the Second World War, where he became the world authority on the behaviour of animals in the wild: his inspiring book The Study of Instinct remains an all-time classic.As a scientist Niko will always be known for the four fundamentally different ways in which he asked the question 'why does an animal do this?' These questions, about physiology, development, evolution, and function, became known as 'Tinbergen's four whys'. But Niko's successes came at a price - severe and devastating depressions that were to plague him throughout his career.In this fascinating and engaging story, Niko's long-time friend and student Hans Kruuk argues that his impact as a scientist and naturalist was in large part due to his skills as a communicator, photographer, and film-maker. Niko's Nature is an intimate and insightful portrait of an extraordinary figure.},

	abstract = {One of the most powerful nationalist ideas in modern Europe is the assertion that there is a link between people and their landscape. Focusing on the heart of German romanticism, the Rhineland, Thomas Lekan examines nature protection activities from Wilhelmine Germany through the end of the Nazi era to illuminate the relationship between environmental reform and the cultural construction of national identity. In the late nineteenth century, anxieties about national character infused ecological concerns about industrialization, spurring landscape preservationists to protect the natural environment. In the Rhineland's scenic rivers, forests, and natural landmarks, they saw Germany as a timeless and organic nation rather than a recently patchworked political construct. Landscape preservation also served conservative social ends during a period of rapid modernization, as outdoor pursuits were promoted to redirect class-conscious factory workers and unruly youth from crass materialism to the German homeland. Lekan's examination of Nazi environmental policy challenges recent work on the green Nazis by showing that the Third Reich systematically subordinated environmental concerns to war mobilization and racial hygiene. This book is an original contribution not only to studies of national identity in modern Germany but also to the growing field of European environmental history.},

	abstract = {A charismatic naturalist, bird-watcher, teacher, artist, photographer, film-maker, and winner of the Nobel Prize, Niko Tinbergen was a prominent and influential scientist. Jointly with Konrad Lorenz, he laid the foundation for a new science, the biological study of animal behaviour. 'Ethology', and his talent for devising behaviour-testing experiments, provided an outlet for Niko's enthusiasm for gulls and sticklebacks, snow-buntings and foxes, wasps and falcons, and even children.This first full-length biography of Niko Tinbergen, lavishly illustrated with many of Niko's own drawings, describes his background in Holland, a naturalists' paradise, and the beginnings of his investigations into the behaviour of birds, fish, and insects. Hans Kruuk also explores is Niko's relationship with his colleague and co-Nobelist Konrad Lorenz. These were two men full of contrasts: Niko a charming, self-effacing field man and experimenter; Konrad a flamboyant and egocentric German, always full of new ideas. Niko's Nature goes on to follow Niko's progress in Oxford after the Second World War, where he became the world authority on the behaviour of animals in the wild: his inspiring book The Study of Instinct remains an all-time classic.As a scientist Niko will always be known for the four fundamentally different ways in which he asked the question 'why does an animal do this?' These questions, about physiology, development, evolution, and function, became known as 'Tinbergen's four whys'. But Niko's successes came at a price - severe and devastating depressions that were to plague him throughout his career.In this fascinating and engaging story, Niko's long-time friend and student Hans Kruuk argues that his impact as a scientist and naturalist was in large part due to his skills as a communicator, photographer, and film-maker. Niko's Nature is an intimate and insightful portrait of an extraordinary figure.},

Barber says that the economic impact of the ban on imported leeches will be felt in Ontario bait and tourism industries for at least a decade. Ontario says it wants to ban the import of leeches because of the risk of importing exotic invading species with the leeches.


The leeches, often called bloodsuckers, that plague swimmers in some lakes are not the same leeches that the bait industry harvests and sells. Bait leeches are often referred to as stealth leeches. At the moment there is no successful commercial culture of leeches in North America.},

	abstract = {As humanity presses down inexorably on the natural world, people debate the extent to which we can save the Earth's millions of different species without sacrificing human economic welfare. But is this argument wise? Must the human and natural worlds be adversaries?In this book, ecologist Michael Rosenzweig finds that ecological science actually rejects such polarization. Instead it suggests that, to be successful, conservation must discover how we can blend a rich natural world into the world of economic activity. This revolutionary, common ground between development and conservation is called reconciliation ecology: creating and maintaining species-friendly habitats in the very places where people live, work, or play.The book offers many inspiring examples of the good results already achieved. The Nature Conservancy, for instance, has a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense, with more than 200 conservation projects taking place on more than 170 bases in 41 states. In places such as Elgin Air Force Base, the human uses-testing munitions, profitable timbering and recreation--continue, but populations of several threatened species on the base, such as the long-leaf pine and the red-cockaded woodpecker, have been greatly improved. The Safe Harbor strategy of the Fish \& Wildlife Service encourages private landowners to improve their property for endangered species, thus overcoming the unintended negative aspects of the Endangered Species Act. And Golden Gate Park, which began as a system of sand dunes, has become, through human effort, a world of ponds and shrubs, waterfowl and trees.Rosenzweig shows that reconciliation ecology is the missing tool of conservation, the practical, scientifically based approach that, when added to the rest, will solve the problem of preserving Earth's species.},

These exciting prospects are accompanied by considerable unease, however, about matters such as safety and ethics. This book identifies science-based and policy-related concerns about animal biotechnology?key issues that must be resolved before the new breakthroughs can reach their potential.

The book includes a short history of the field and provides understandable definitions of terms like cloning. Looking at technologies on the near horizon, the authors discuss what we know and what we fear about their effects?the inadvertent release of dangerous microorganisms, the safety of products derived from biotechnology, the impact of genetically engineered animals on their environment. In addition to these concerns, the book explores animal welfare concerns, and our societal and institutional capacity to manage and regulate the technology and its products. This accessible volume will be important to everyone interested in the implications of the use of animal biotechnology.},

Unless they are stopped, the carp will have a devastating effect on commercial and sports fishing in our Great Lakes. Asian carp daily consume up to 40 per cent of their body weight in zoo plankton, vegetation, or mussels and fish. Because the females can lay up to one million eggs, they can quickly displace local species from their native habitats.},

Additionally, it focuses on the role of DOM in elemental cycling - where the greatest informational need currently exists.  Biological cycling of the major elements through DOM is assessed throughout, with particular emphasis on the role of marine microbes as active agents in the processing of this materialThe ocean science community's advances for inclusion of DOM in both ecosystem and global circulation models are evaluated},

With wit, humor, a calm voice, and great authority, Swimming Lessons gives a clear view of what our world has become - not just our successes, but also the destruction set loose by our own genius and inventions. In addition, it offers practical, non-utopian suggestions for keeping afloat in the dangerous waters of the 21st century's globalized civilization.Whether it is describing a comical brainstorming session in a Washington boardroom or a close encounter with an Alaskan grizzly and her cubs, Swimming Lessons is a delight to read. Trained in history, medicine, and zoology, David Ehrenfeld brings a grand perspective to his challenging task. He writes not just as a scientist, but as one who values and understands the social sciences and humanities as well. In the first half of Swimming Lessons, we learn to recognize the lies we live: about education, new military weapons systems, biotechnology, electronic pseudocommunities, and accelerated obsolescence. We also learn about the deadly corporate economics that affect every aspect of our lives, even environmental conservation. The second half reveals the pitfalls and opportunities in the main tasks we face: relating to nature in a manmade world and restoring our damaged communities.},

The framework has seven stages, beginning with problem definition, continuing through assessment of risks and management options, and ending with an evaluation of the success of the management strategy. At the center of the framework is continuous and active involvement of all affected parties--particularly communities--in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the management strategy. A Risk-Management Strategy for PCB-Contaminated Sediments emphasizes the need to consider all risks at a contaminated site, not just human health and ecological effects, but also the social, cultural, and economic impacts. Given the controversy that has arisen at many PCB-contaminated sites, this book provides a consistent, yet flexible, approach for dealing with the many issues associated with assessing and managing the risks at Superfund and other contaminated sites.

	abstract = {In 1988, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began an investigation of the benefits and costs of extending several locks on the lower portion of the Upper Mississippi River-Illinois Waterway (UMR-IWW) in order to relieve increasing waterway congestion, particularly for grain moving to New Orleans for export. With passage of the Flood Control Act of 1936, Congress required that the Corps conduct a benefit-cost analysis as part of its water resources project planning; Congress will fund water resources projects only if a project's benefits exceed its costs. As economic analysis generally, and benefit-cost analysis in particular, has become more sophisticated, and as environmental and social considerations and analysis have become more important, Corps planning studies have grown in size and complexity. The difficulty in commensurating market and nonmarket costs and benefits also presents the Corps with a significant challenge. The Corps' analysis of the UMR-IWW has extended over a decade, has cost roughly \$50 million, and has involved consultations with other federal agencies, state conservation agencies, and local citizens. The analysis has included many consultants and has produced dozens of reports. 
In February 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) requested that the National Academies review the Corps' final feasibility report. After discussions and negotiations with DOD, in April 2000 the National Academies launched this review and appointed an expert committee to carry it out.},

The USGS will no doubt continue to evolve and adapt to meet changing national needs. In fact, the recent integration of the National Biological Service and parts of the U.S. Bureau of Mines into the USGS presents an ideal opportunity to examine the agency's vision, mission, role, and scientific opportunities as the organization begins the early years of the twenty-first century. The USGS recognized the need to adapt to changing demands when it asked the National Research Council (NRC) to undertake this study. The NRC formed a multidisciplinary committee of 16 experts to address issues related to the future roles, challenges, and opportunities of the agency.},

To analyse the potential threat of so-called No-BOBs (No ballast on board ships), a local team led by [Hugh MacIsaac], of which Bandoni is a member, will join a binational effort this year, boarding up to 40 No-BOB ships at their first Great Lakes ports of call and taking samplings of what's lurking at the bottom of their holds.                 At the current rate of unwanted foreign species entering the Great Lakes, Bandoni says "it's very possible" the researchers might even detect a potential newcomer.

Our Common Journey examines these questions to draw strategic connections between scientific research, technological development, and societies' efforts to achieve environmentally sustainable improvements in human well-being. The book argues that societies should approach sustainable development not as a destination but as an ongoing, adaptive learning process. It proposes a strategy for using scientific and technical knowledge to better inform future action in the areas of fertility reduction, urban systems, agricultural production, energy and materials use, ecosystem restoration, and biodiversity conservation.
Our Common Journey documents large-scale historical currents of social and environmental change and reviews methods for "what if" analyses of possible future development pathways and their implications for sustainability. The book also identifies the greatest threats to sustainability -- in areas such as human settlements, agriculture, industry, and energy -- and explores the most promising opportunities for circumventing or mitigating these threats.
World human population is expected to reach upwards of 9 billion by 2050 and then level off over the next half-century. How can the transition to a stabilizing population also be a transition to sustainability? How can science and technology help to ensure that human needs are met while the planet's environment is nurtured and restored?

Our Common Journey examines these momentous questions to draw strategic connections between scientific research, technological development, and societies' efforts to achieve environmentally sustainable improvements in human well being. The book argues that societies should approach sustainable development not as a destination but as an ongoing, adaptive learning process. Speaking to the next two generations, it proposes a strategy for using scientific and technical knowledge to better inform future action in the areas of fertility reduction, urban systems, agricultural production, energy and materials use, ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation, and suggests an approach for building a new research agenda for sustainability science.

Our Common Journey documents large-scale historical currents of social and environmental change and reviews methods for "what if" analysis of possible future development pathways and their implications for sustainability. The book also identifies the greatest threats to sustainability?in areas such as human settlements, agriculture, industry, and energy?and explores the most promising opportunities for circumventing or mitigating these threats. It goes on to discuss what indicators of change, from children's birth-weights to atmosphere chemistry, will be most useful in monitoring a transition to sustainability.},

	abstract = {IN MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S TIME, every third land bird in North America was a passenger pigeon. Ranging across Eastern Canada and the United States, these handsome birds moved in flocks so large they literally darkened the skies. In 1914, the last surviving passenger, a female named Martha, died in a Cincinnati zoo. The loss of the passenger pigeon is perhaps the best known of the human-caused species extinctions in North America. It was not the first, it may not have been the biggest and it certainly will not be the last. One hundred years ago our ancestors clubbed, shot, trapped, drugged and poisoned the passenger pigeon with incredible abandon. The very abundance of these birds, as with the buffalo, seemed to trigger a kind of contempt. Cruella De Vil, the villain in Disney's 101 Dalmatians, expresses this bizarre quirk of human psychology when she proclaims, "I love the smell of near extinction." Since then we have experienced a partial change of heart. Today we see individuals, descendants of those same ancestors that trashed the passenger pigeon, going to great lengths to save an obscure, economically useless, and slightly comical-looking bird called the burrowing owl. The last century has witnessed the development of a remarkable movement to identify endangered birds, mammals, fishes and plants, and to protect them from extinction. The story of the endangered species movement is really the story of a single, widely distributed and highly problematic species: Homo sapiens. It is a classically human story, pitting ignorance against scholarship, avarice against altruism, indifference against compassion. Endangered species grab our attention because we tend to respond, as a culture and perhaps as a species, to crises. Look at our society's approach to the two important activities of medical care and forest fire protection. Crisis response activities in both fields are highly organized, staffed and funded. Preventative activities, on the other hand, are assigned a much lower status, with small programs and intermittent funding. So too with endangered species; nowhere can you find data on the biology and dynamics of passenger pigeon populations when they were healthy, yet we carefully husbanded the last survivor, and marked not only the day but the hour of her passing. Our instinctive attitude toward other species seems to range from indifference to antipathy. Driving into a Saskatchewan farmyard once, I encountered a group of kids huddled around a tiger salamander that had made the fatal mistake of leaving a nearby dugout. The little girls in the group played at being terrified, and the little boys played at being brave, as they methodically smashed the salamander to bits. Concern for other species, particularly for those that have no immediate economic value to us, is a learned response, one we still struggle with. Economists tell us that the marketplace can assign a correct utilitarian value to every species. Market logic would determine the value of the cotton or the wheat plant, for example, to be quite substantial. On the other hand, the value of Furbish's lousewort, a curious plant found only on the Saint John River in New Brunswick and Maine, would be zero, since it has no marginal or exchange value. Fortunately, we are beginning to assign non-market, social values to species like the lousewort, the burrowing owl and the horned toad. But these values are in direct opposition to our present socio-economic system, according to which the lousewort and its friends are "useless." The commonly held view is that anthropogenic, or human-caused, species extinctions are a phenomenon of contemporary North American culture and technology. European immigrants certainly disrupted the natural ecology of this continent, but their actions were part of a universal tradition. Anthropologists now conclude that human-caused species extinctions have occurred throughout history. We tend to arrive on new land masses like the Hell's Angels at a church picnic: unexpected, ignorant and destructive. The pattern is monotonously similar. When immigrant humans colonize a new land mass, within hundreds or a few thousand years, a suite of wildlife species disappears. Yet it is also useful to acknowledge that the natural world can be ruthless with its creatures. There have been, and will be, species extinctions that humans have had absolutely no part in. Our ability to control nature is so extensive that it is difficult for us to accept that change is a fundamental dynamic of nature. The world around us is more a process than a fixed entity, as Canada's recent climate history amply demonstrates. Much of the country was empty and lifeless at the end of the last Ice Age, a mere 10,000 years ago.},

Williams offers his own perspective on modern evolutionary theory, including discussions of the gene as the unit of selection, clade selection and macroevolution, diversity within and among populations, stasis, and other timely and provocative topics. In dealing with the levels-of-selection controversy, he urges a pervasive form of the replicator-vehicle distinction. Natural selection, he argues, takes place in the separate domains of information and matter. Levels-of-selection questions, consequently, require different theoretical devices depending on the domains being discussed. In addressing these topics, Williams presents a synthesis of his three decades of research and creative thought which have contributed greatly to evolutionary biology in this century.},

Ottawa issued a report that, for the first time, acknowledged the pollution is damaging the environment. Later it announced Canada's mills face stiff penalties if they don't "virtually eliminate" dioxin and furan emissions by the end of 1993. But it also said they could request extensions.                 * Great Lakes. A federal report acknowledged for the first time that toxic pollution in the Great Lakes is a threat to human health. Shortly before the report was released, Ottawa announced that as part of its Green Plan, it would spend \$25 million to promote and research pollution prevention and virtual elimination of toxic emissions into the lakes.

Now, with a small amount of funding from Wildlife Habitat Canada, Keddy is doing further research on purple loosestrife at Presqu'ile Provincial Park near Brighton, Ont.
