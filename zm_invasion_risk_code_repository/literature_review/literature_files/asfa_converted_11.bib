	abstract = {Population and economic growth means increased demand on an already-taxed water supply.

Given the demands on the province's water supply in the south, the idea of interbasin diversion could be on the table, said Tricia Stadnyk, a professor and Canada Research Chair in hydrologic modelling with the University of Calgary's Schulich School of Engineering.

Water chemistry, invasive species, water sharing In such a scenario, it would be important to keep in mind that such diversions change the water type, because the water source is changed.

"Right down from the temperature of the water that affects the ability of fish to spawn, to the aquatic biota that can live within that water because of sensitivities to pH and other aspects of water quality."},

	abstract = {Summary
Choosing the optimum assembly approach is essential to achieving a high-quality genome assembly suitable for comparative and evolutionary genomic investigations. Significant recent progress in long-read sequencing technologies such as PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) also brought about a large variety of assemblers. Although these have been extensively tested on model species such as Homo sapiens and Drosophila melanogaster, such benchmarking has not been done in Mollusca which lacks widely adopted model species. Molluscan genomes are notoriously rich in repeats and are often highly heterozygous, making their assembly challenging. Here, we benchmarked 10 assemblers based on ONT raw reads from two published molluscan genomes of differing properties, the gastropod Chrysomallon squamiferum (356.6Mb, 1.59\% heterozygosity) and the bivalve Mytilus coruscus (1593Mb, 1.94\% heterozygosity). By optimising the assembly pipeline, we greatly improved both genomes from previously published versions. Our results suggested that 40-50X of ONT reads are sufficient for high-quality genomes, with Flye being the recommended assembler for compact and less heterozygous genomes exemplified by C. squamiferum, while NextDenovo excelled for more repetitive and heterozygous molluscan genomes exemplified by M. coruscus. A phylogenomic analysis utilising the two updated genomes with other 32 published high-quality lophotrochozoan genomes resulted in maximum support across all nodes, and we show that improved genome quality also leads to more complete matrices for phylogenomic inferences. Our benchmarking will ensure the efficiency in future assemblies for molluscs and perhaps also other marine phyla with few genomes available.

Wildlife Species: A species, subspecies, variety, or geographically or genetically distinct population of animal, plant or other organism, other than a bacterium or virus, that is wild by nature and is either native to Canada or has extended its range into Canada without human intervention and has been present in Canada for at least 50 years.Extinct (X): A wildlife species that no longer exists.Extirpated (XT): A wildlife species that no longer exists in the wild in Canada, but exists elsewhere.Endangered (E): A wildlife species facing imminent extirpation or extinction.Threatened (T): A wildlife species that is likely to become Endangered if nothing is done to reverse the factors leading to its extirpation or extinction. Special Concern (SC): A wildlife species that may become Threatened or Endangered because of a combination of biological characteristics and identified threats.Not at Risk (NAR): A wildlife species that has been evaluated and found to be not at risk of extinction given the current circumstances. Data Deficient (DD): A category that applies when the available information is insufficient (a) to resolve a wildlife species' eligibility for assessment or (b) to permit an assessment of the wildlife species' risk of extinction.Species at Risk: A wildlife species that has been assessed as Extirpated, Endangered, Threatened or Special Concern.},

Lake Ontario Waterkeeper, \$100,000: By collecting, archiving, and sharing Canada's water stories, the Watermark Project protects Canada's water heritage. Through the Project, participants discover their personal connection to water, or their "watermark." The Project includes building a digital platform to store, exhibit and share "watermarks," creating a community management program to train volunteers to collect "watermarks" and disseminate information about urban waters, and producing the first collection of "watermarks" to seed an archive.              Groupe D'Education Et D'Ecosurveillance De L'Eau, \$20,000: Imagine 3,000 Quebec youth aged 10 to 21 involved in the protection and conservation of aquatic ecosystems. That's exactly what the Adopt a River network is. In partnership with local stakeholders, young students will study their urban waterways while being encouraged to take care of it. More than a simple educational project, Adopt a River offers the unique opportunity for an educational experience, and to be proactive in solving current problems. It gives young people a chance to get actively involved in water conservation while allowing them to apply their knowledge. Thanks to support from a network of organizations and schools across the province, the project will offer young people a unique scientific experience and the opportunity to get involved in their community, while working toward a common goal: preserving urban waterways.},

	abstract = {OTTAWA, Nov. 29 /CNW/ - Two birds considered extremely rare to Canada were both re-assessed as Endangered despite recovery initiatives. The White-headed Woodpecker and Sage Thrasher are just two of the 52 Canadian wildlife species that were assessed for risk of extinction or extirpation by COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) when it met in Ottawa, November 22-26, 2010. Of the thirty-two species that were re-assessed after 10 years, as required by the Species at Risk Act, only four were found to be less at risk.              There are now 617 wildlife species in various COSEWIC risk categories, including 270 Endangered, 153 Threatened, 172 Special Concern, and 22 Extirpated (i.e. no longer found in the wild in Canada). In addition to these wildlife species that are in COSEWIC risk categories, there are 14 wildlife species that are Extinct.              Wildlife Species: A species, subspecies, variety, or geographically or genetically distinct population of animal, plant or other organism, other than a bacterium or virus, that is wild by nature and is either native to Canada or has extended its range into Canada without human intervention and has been present in Canada for at least 50 years. Extinct (X): A wildlife species that no longer exists. Extirpated (XT)*: A wildlife species that no longer exists in the wild in Canada, but exists elsewhere. Endangered (E)*: A wildlife species facing imminent extirpation or extinction. Threatened (T)*: A wildlife species that is likely to become Endangered if nothing is done to reverse the factors leading to its extirpation or extinction. Special Concern (SC)*: A wildlife species that may become Threatened or Endangered because of a combination of biological characteristics and identified threats. Not at Risk (NAR): A wildlife species that has been evaluated and found to be not at risk of extinction given the current circumstances. Data Deficient (DD): A category that applies when the available information is insufficient (a) to resolve a wildlife species' eligibility for assessment or (b) to permit an assessment of the wildlife species' risk of extinction.},

	abstract = {Today, the evidence suggests that training and job opportunities are limited and research funding has stagnated. As a result, we have seen a decline in Canada's international contribution to new species descriptions falling from 6th in the 1980s to 14th in the 2000s. The Expert Panel also observed that although Canada has impressive biodiversity collections and a strong digital infrastructure, most information is trapped in cabinets rather than being accessible on the internet. As a result, Canada's data sharing efforts compare poorly internationally. Approximately 80 per cent of Canada's online biodiversity information is being held outside Canada.              "The Expert Panel's report is the most comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of Canada's taxonomic expertise and biodiversity collections available," said Elizabeth Dowdeswell, President of the Council of Canadian Academies. "I look forward to a discussion of the findings when we host Dr. [Thomas E. Lovejoy] in Ottawa on November 29th, for a workshop on the future of Canadian taxonomy. This event will initiate an important conversation regarding the opportunities and challenges identified in the Panel's report, including a vision for Canada."

	abstract = {Ontario's dependence on imported fossil fuels for the energy requirements of society and industry is environmentally and economically unsustainable. Dr. [Greg Naterer] at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology is developing new energy technologies that include thermochemical hydrogen production, micro energy sources powered by nanotechnology and "entropy-based design" to improve energy efficiency. His research will reduce the environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions of power systems, as well as develop technology commercialization opportunities for the province's energy sector.                Good crop yields depend on an adequate supply of nitrogen. But what's the optimum amount of nitrogen? That's the question Dr. [Laura Van Eerd] wants to answer at a new facility at the University of Guelph dedicated to innovation in soil fertility and plant nutrition in horticultural crops. The goal of Dr. Van Eerd's research is the development of new approaches to maintaining or improving crop yields by optimizing nitrogen use, while minimizing its environmental impact on ground water - a subject of tremendous interest to the agricultural sector. Dr. Van Eerd's research will also be used to assess new legislation regarding nutrient management and drinking water source protection in Ontario.                Systematics is the science that names, classifies and determines the evolutionary relationships of organisms. It's becoming increasingly important to Ontario as the province's unique biodiversity becomes ever more threatened by global warming, invasive species and habitat loss. At a new Laboratory for Molecular Systematics at the University of Ottawa, Dr. [Julian Starr] is using DNA fragment and sequencing techniques to study the Cyperaceae (sedges) and other land plants. This plant group represents one of the most diverse, ecologically significant and economically important plant families on earth and it dominates vast tracks of Ontario's land. But this unique diversity is threatened and Dr. Starr hopes to save it for future generations. In the process he aims to develop new molecular techniques for recognizing biodiversity and combating its loss on earth.},

	abstract = {Ever wonder what Santa does for his summer holidays? It seems he goes to Muskoka. Located in Bracebridge, Santa's Village has just celebrated SO surreal years as a winter-in-thesummer wonderland, complete with a candy cane water park, a Christmas Ball Ferris Wheel and live reindeer. Situated on the 45th parallel, precisely halfway between the North Pole and the equator (or so the shtick goes), the village was dreamed up by Bracebridge residents back in the 19505. The idea was to attract tourists and cottagers to the town. And it worked-Santa welcomed his five millionth visitor last summer. Curiously, people can't seem to get enough of attractions like Santa's Summer Sleigh River Boat cruise, which subjects passengers to piped-in carols in the middle of July; or Mrs. Claus's bakeshop, where you can pick up gingerbread cookies and homemade fudge. For the kid who really doesn't want to sit on Santa's knee, there is the adjoining Sportsland theme park, where he can play Mister Rudolph's Birdies and Bogeys minigolf course or try his hand at Babe Rudolph's Batting Challenge.              One of the gems of the Bruce Peninsula, the sleepy town of Lion's Head offers more than just a pit stop on the way to Tobermory. Lion's Head Beach Park is a scenic place for lunch: picnic tables and harbourside barbecues are set against a dramatic backdrop of limestone cliffs. After lunch, take a roadside walk from the beach to the trailhead, passing dozens of apple trees along the way. The [Bruce Trail] joins with the Lion's Head Provincial Nature Reserve, home to a pair of lo,ooo-year-old glacial potholes. Novice hikers be warned: after the second pothole, the trail leading to McKay's Harbour gets very challenging. The terrain is rocky, with sudden dips and steep climbs. It's worth the effort, though: the clifftop views of Georgian Bay are spectacular. For an aprèshike drink, stop by Lion's Head Inn and sample Bruce County's own premium lager on tap or hop over to Mary-Dale's, a local favourite, for a meal. If you decide to stay the night, camping is available at Lion's Head Beach Park. The best time to visit is summer or fall, as most tourist sites, such as the Artists' Co-Op Gallery (home to handcrafted works by artists from the Grey and Bruce counties), close after Thanksgiving. Outside of peak season, charming clothing and tinker shops such as The Cottage and the Port Authority are open to visitors every Saturday up until Christmas.              One of the prettiest towns in the land, Creemore is becoming Ontario's equivalent of the Hamptons. It's easy to see why Torontonians are flocking here for a relaxing getaway (and after they've spent a weekend, why they stay for their retirement). Lying in a valley between the aptly named Mad and Noisy Rivers, surrounded by the undulating purple hills of Mulmur, Creemore has retained its turn-of-the-century charm. In the heart of the village, Creemore Springs Brewery (139 Mill St., 1-800-267-2240) makes its lager the old-fashioned way, in copper kettles, using water from a nearby spring. Take a guided tour to see how the beer is mashed, mixed and bottled; afterward, sample some in the gift shop, located in the town's first hardware store. If in need of some sustenance, drop by Creemore Picnic, a café and cooking studio where you can pick up gourmet offerings (Moroccan chicken tajine) or simple standbys like freshly baked scones. Stroll over to the Station on the Green; the former site of the town's train station, it is now home to the Saturday farmers' market. Adjacent to the Green is Creemore's historic 1892 jail, which is worth a (very) quick look-at 300 square feet, it's North America's smallest slammer. Inviting home decor shops, antique stores, eateries and art galleries line the main street. Dash over to Mad River Pottery, a serene store of porcelain and stoneware by local craftsman Paul Vorstermans. His sturdy bowls and platters often carry a pine motif and make for a classy souvenir.},

	abstract = {TORONTO, Nov. 27 /CNW/ - Gord Miller, Environmental Commissioner of Ontario (ECO), released his fourth annual report to the Legislature today, calling on Ontario to "think beyond the near and now" in confronting the environmental challenges facing the province. The essential need to preserve Ontario's biological diversity is a major theme of this year's report, which has articles on the large number of species at risk in Ontario, the severe shortage of native tree seeds, and the threats to native animal and plant species from urban sprawl, industry, forestry and invasive species. Biodiversity is a concern that brings together some of the most serious environmental issues facing Ontario, said Miller. Provincial ministries work away at fragments of these issues, he added, but what is needed is an integrated strategy that would deal with these interrelated problems in a coordinated way.                 One of the key findings in this year's ECO report deals with the environmental impacts of discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants, a major cause of water pollution in Ontario. The report also covers other risks to ground and surface water - from paper mill sludge in gun club berms and sewage sludge spread on farmlands, to the improper disposal of dead farm animals. Ontario is using up its deposits of sand and gravel for road construction, according to the report, without fully considering the environmental effects on aggregate-rich areas such as the Niagara Escarpment. Future generation of electricity - a significant source of smog and greenhouse gases - for Ontario's growing population must be balanced with protection of the environment, said Commissioner [Miller].                 Although invasive species have been called the number one threat to the biodiversity of the Great Lakes Basin, Ontario's slow and piecemeal efforts to combat this threat don't begin to reflect the seriousness of the problem. More than 160 of these species have invaded the Great Lakes Basin since the 1800s, including zebra mussels, sea lampreys, and gypsy moths. Today the emerald ash borer is threatening to spread to southwestern Ontario, putting at risk one billion ash trees in Ontario, and the Asian carp, which "vacuums" up fish, mussels and vegetation, is now found only a few kilometers from Lake Michigan.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence indicates Asian carp, prolific non-indigenous aquatic nuisance species, may now be within 25 miles of Lake Michigan - putting the entire Great Lakes Basin ecosystem at highest risk of invasion.  Three species of Asian carp (silver, bighead, and black) were purposefully introduced to the southern USA to control problematic algal blooms and populations of snails that affected the fish aquaculture industry.  The bighead and silver carp species escaped from confinement during major flood events in the early 1990's, and entered the Mississippi River.  Since this time, they have moved up through the Mississippi River system, and now occur in the Illinois River and are approaching the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal, which is connected, to the Great Lakes near Chicago, Illinois.  It is believed that, based upon their current rate of dispersal, Asian carp could reach Lake Michigan from the Mississippi -Illinois system within this year.  In addition, one Bighead carp was collected in a net in Lake Erie in 2000 by scientists at the University of Guelph and another was found in a fountain in downtown Toronto, most likely the result of intentional releases.                 The Corps of Engineers, working in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency, initially began design and construction of an electronic dispersal barrier to determine if the movement of invasive species from the Great Lakes basin into the Mississippi River system could be halted. The round goby (another well known non-indigenous aquatic invasive species) was the initial focus of this effort. Although this project was not completed in time to prevent the movement of the round goby into the Mississippi River, this \$2.2 million barrier system may be effective in preventing the movement of Asian carp into the Great Lakes. The electrical barrier was turned on in April 2002. However, as currently authorized, this barrier is only a limited life, experimental prototype and is scheduled to be removed at the end of the 18- month Corps investigation. It will require more extensive testing and modification to ensure that it effectively prevents movement of Asian carp into the Great Lakes. The current prototype design and funding level does not provide for a backup electrical generator, so that in the absence of electrical power, the barrier will fail (the Chicago area experiences frequent electrical supply interruptions).                 Both governments need to consider implementing regulatory controls to prevent introduction of Asian carp via other pathways such as the food and bait fish industries, the aquarium trade, and aquaculture. Other issues that should be considered include establishing regulatory controls to prevent importation of live species of Asian carp, educating the retailers and purchasers of Asian carp for food about the threat of Asian carp to the Great Lakes ecosystem, and discouraging transport of personally-caught bait or water (boat wells, fish lockers) from one water body to another within the Mississippi River-Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River ecosystems.},

	abstract = {If you can plan far in advance to avoid programming conficts, the bustling CBC building offers two special event spots: the Barbara Frum Atrium, a 10-storey, glass-roofed area (500 for dinner, 900 for cocktails); and the semicircular Artists' Lounge (60 for dinner, 100 for cocktails), bordered by floor-to-ceiling windows. The scene stealers, however, are six rehearsal halls (150 for receptions, 120 for dinner) and a trio of rooftop studios (600 for cocktails, 400 for dinner), all with high-tech AV equipment and special lighting options to captivate your audience. Studio 40, the largest at 14,000 square feet, comes complete with catwalks--ideal for more outrageous orators. The studios and rehearsal halls suit last-minute revellers (note: space cannot be confirmed until 30 days prior to an event).              Don't judge a place by the loftiness of its name. Le Parc, with two separate locations, is no elite venue. Prices match its suburban status (i.e., they're not as likely to cause coronaries). Although the biggest ballroom of the lot sports a decidedly unromantic name (it's made up of two adjoining spaces, called simply Le Parc 1 and Le Parc 2), decadence is in abundance in this sprawling, chandeliered 15,000-square-foot space (seats 1,700,1,000 with dancing); massive Italian weddings, engagement parties and birthdays are prime on Le Pare's Looking list, Pre-dinner cocktail receptions take place in the light and breezy private atrium (named Le Parc 1 Reception), featuring floor-to-ceiling windows, cascading flowers and greenery. The on-site chef, known simply as Chef Mario, can whip up an eight-course Italian dinner no problemo. Most pastas are made from scratch on-site, fit to please the most finicky of nonnas.              The strategy 16 years ago was to target local suits, though weddings and private home affairs have now become staples. Not to mention the swanky business brunch: gingerbread pancakes with apple butter, banana pancakes with cinnamon-rum syrup, lemon-poppy seed hotcakes with lemon-scented honey bacon, and chive potato pancakes with whipped butter. Evening menus begin with spicy Atlantic salmon tartare with chipotle oil on Armenian flatbread points, or potato latkes sandwiching sauteed wild mushrooms and herb-speckled mayo. For the corporate buffet: sausage and wild mushroom lasagna with red pepper-tomato sauce. Golden onion and zucchini lasagna is topped with a white wine and parmesan cream sauce. Holiday sweet tables see raspberry and ginger creme brulee garnished with melted chocolate biscuit and two white chocolate and macadamia nut cookies. Dinner requests lean to rack of lamb with eggplant pancakes and basil olive oil, presented with a lobster-filled baked potato and a harvest of seasonal grilled vegetables. Raspberry and ginger creme brulee completes the dinner combo.},

	abstract = {Dr. [John Madsen] said a tiny minority of irresponsible fishing enthusiasts in the U.S. is suspected of deliberately spreading hydrilla to water bodies. The reason: some fishers believe hydrilla improves habitat for largemouth bass. As well, fish searching for food along the edge of a hydrilla mat become easier to catch.                 So serious is the hydrilla situation in Florida that, in 1987, the state tried introducing the Pakistani hydrilla tuber weevil, which feeds on the weed. Unfortunately, the weevil eats hydrilla tubers only when water recedes from the plants, which occurs commonly in Pakistan but is rare in Florida, except when lakes are drained. Another biocontrol agent, hydrilla leaf-mining fly is from Pakistan, was also released in 1987 with greater success.                 Most alien plants now established in the U.S. were introduced for food, fiber, or ornamental purposes. An estimated 5,000 introduced plant species have escaped and now exist in U.S. natural ecosystems, compared with a total of about 17,000 species native to the U.S. In Florida alone, more than 900 alien plant species imported mainly as ornamentals for cultivation have escaped and become established in the ecosystem.},

	abstract = {The collected works of Anne Sexton showcase the astonishing career of one of the twentieth century's most influential poets For Anne Sexton, writing served as both a means of expressing the inner turmoil she experienced for most of her life and as a therapeutic force through which she exorcised her demons. Some of the richest poetic descriptions of depression, anxiety, and desperate hope can be found within Sexton's work. The Complete Poems, which includes the eight collections published during her life, two posthumously published books, and other poems collected after her death, brings together her remarkable body of work with all of its range of emotion. With her first collection, the haunting To Bedlam and Part Way Back, Sexton stunned critics with her frank treatment of subjects like masturbation, incest, and abortion, blazing a trail for representations of the body, particularly the female body, in poetry. She documented four years of mental illness in her moving Pulitzer Prize-winning collection Live or Die, and reimagined classic fairy tales as macabre and sardonic poems in Transformations. The Awful Rowing Toward God, the last book finished in her lifetime, is an earnest and affecting meditation on the existence of God. As a whole, The Complete Poems reveals a brilliant yet tormented poet who bared her deepest urges, fears, and desires in order to create extraordinarily striking and enduring art.},

Leopold Bloom, who is sure that his wife is being unfaithful, must come to terms with how that affects their marriage and whether it changes the nature of their love for one another. Richly detailed stream-of-consciousness narration immerses the reader in the thoughts and emotions of the characters as they deal with the normal events of daily life in Dublin, as well as grander issues like sexuality, prejudice, birth, and death. This is an unabridged version of Irish author James Joyce's groundbreaking modernist tale, which parallels Homer's Odyssey. It was first published serially in the American journal The Little Review between 1918 and 1921, and published in novel form in 1922 in Paris.},
