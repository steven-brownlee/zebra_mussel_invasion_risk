	abstract = {The water quality and resources of Lake Ontario's nearshore ecosystem undergo heightened stress, particularly along the northwest shoreline. Hydrodynamic processes linking the distinct nearshore and offshore trophic structures play a crucial role in transporting nutrient-loaded water along and across the shore. Despite the pivotal connection between algae growth and the development of nuisance proportions, the scales over which these processes operate remain poorly understood. This study delves into the exchange dynamics between nearshore and offshore areas of Lake Ontario throughout 2018, employing a validated three-dimensional numerical model. A virtual passive age tracer is utilized to discern horizontal mixing time scales between nearshore regions of the lake (water depth {\textless} 30 m) and offshore locations. The dispersal pattern, as revealed by a passive tracer released from eight points around the model lake's perimeter, indicates more extensive diffusion in late summer when lake-wide stratification is established, compared to the mixed period. Coastal upwelling events, leading to intrusions of hypolimnetic waters, significantly contribute to net cross-shore transport, with the most pronounced effects observed in May and June when the offshore thermocline is shallow. In the northern part of the lake, dispersal predominantly occurs alongshore, mirroring the prevailing cyclonic (counterclockwise) coastal circulation during the stratified season. This pattern is a consequence of a 45\% increase in upwelling events compared to three decades ago. In the northwestern and southern sectors of the lake, elevated cross-shore mixing is attributed to geomorphology-induced cross-basin currents.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Noise pollution is a major stressor in the marine environment; however, responses of economically and ecologically important invertebrates, such as oysters, are largely unknown. Under laboratory conditions, we measured acute behavioural and physiological responses of eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) to sound treatments mimicking human activity in the environment. Oysters immediately reduced their valve gape under simulated pile driving sound, but not drilling or boating sound. Pile-driving sound also reduced adductor muscle glycogen, but not triglyceride. None of the sound treatments affected longer-term (12 hours) valve activity levels after the administration of sounds. Interestingly, neither acute nor longer-term valve gaping responses were correlated with glycogen content on the individual level, suggesting that the observed behavioural responses to sound were not mechanistically driven by energetic physiology. Our results suggest that C. virginica responds to some, but not all, anthropogenic sounds. Future studies assessing downstream effects on growth, reproduction, and survival in the wild are needed to better understand the effects of anthropogenic sounds on oyster populations and the biological communities they support.},

In this work, the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHs) from eight productive oyster areas in the Gulf of Mexico were measured on sediment, water, and tissues from C. virginica. In water, the highest AHs concentration was detected in Tamiahua (0.50 ng/mL), while for PAHs, the highest concentration was {\textgreater} 0.10 ng/mL in Tampamachoco. In sediment, Tamiahua and Tampamachoco lagoons had the highest AHs concentrations with values near 2.5 g/g dry weight. Considering the PAHs, Tamiahua, Carmen, and Tampamachoco lagoons registered the highest levels, with values {\textgreater} 60 ng/g dry weight. In tissues from C. virginica, La Pesca, Cármen and Mecoacán presented the highest PAHs concentrations with values between 0.20 and 0.25 g/g dry weight. From the molecular analysis of genes related with different phases of the xenobiotic detoxification process such as hypoxia inducible factor (HIF1A), cytochrome P450 10 (CYP10), flavin mono-oxygenase (FMO), glutathione S-transferase (GST1), multidrug resistant protein (MDR1), catalase (CAT), among others, the differences between lagoons were significant (P {\textless} 0.05) and generally with Las Enramadas showing the highest expression levels. From genes evaluated in this study, HIF1A, CYP 10, FMO, MDR1 and CAT presented the highest expression differentials between lagoons, suggesting their utility as potentials molecular markers in the assessment of the oil spill effect on marine invertebrates.},

	abstract = {Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) are an abundant and economically important species across the North Sea. Partly because of their potent filter feeding and associated shell biofilm, they are able to influence and alter the surrounding marine ecosystem. As a result of proliferating offshore wind farms (OWFs), whose turbine foundations are rapidly colonised by suspension feeding artificial hard substrate communities dominated by M. edulis, as well as planned co-location strategies of these OWFs with mussel mariculture, their numbers will only increase towards the future. On top of these local stressors, global climate change is exerting additional pressure on the marine environment. This study focusses on the link between M. edulis, its microbial shell biofilm and the local nitrogen cycling by quantifying the magnitude and underlying pathways of mussel-associated nitrous oxide (N2O) production. A set of closed-core incubations established nitrifier denitrification as the main chemical pathway of M. edulis related N2O production, although ammonium, nitrite and nitrate all acted as possible precursors. Additional future-climate experiments revealed that blue mussel’s total N2O production, as well as its metabolic activity and the relative contribution of its shell biofilm, were affected by warming (+ 3°C), acidification (- 0.3 pH units), or the combination of both. Because the effects of temperature and acidity were often of an antagonistic nature, the results suggest a relatively small net effect on local N2O production in future-climate marine environments. However, N2O production rates were several orders of magnitude lower than other measured N species (NH4+, NO2- and NO3-), making substantial mussel-associated N2 production likely. This would greatly affect the local eutrophication levels or even bioavailable nitrogen concentrations.},

Synergistic or additive effects were not seen for plastic microparticles (50 mg L−1) in combination with cypermethrin (10 and 1000 μg L−1) based on evaluation of skeletal abnormalities or arrested development and death of significant numbers of larvae during the embryotoxicity assay. This behaviour was also apparent for male gametes pretreated with PS and PMMA microplastics and cypermethrin, where a reduction in sperm fertilisation ability was not evidenced. However, a modest reduction in the quality of the offspring was noted, suggesting that there may be some transmissible damage to the zygotes. PMMA microparticles were more readily taken up than PS microparticles, which could suggest surface chemical identity as potentially modulating the affinity of larvae for specific plastics. In contrast, significantly reduced toxicity was noted for the combination of PMMA microparticles and cypermethrin (100 μg L−1), and may be related to less ready desorption of the pyrethroid than PS, as well as cypermethrin activating mechanisms that result in reduced feeding and hence decreased ingestion of microparticles.},

The hazards posed by the presence of pharmaceutical is one which affects both freshwater organisms and human health—via non-target effects and by the contamination of drinking water sources. The molecular and phenotypic alterations of five pharmaceuticals which are commonly present in the aquatic environment were explored in daphnids under chronic exposures. Markers of physiology such as enzyme activities were combined with metabolic perturbations to assess the impact of metformin, diclofenac, gabapentin, carbamazepine and gemfibrozil on daphnids. Enzyme activity of markers of physiology included phosphatases, lipase, peptidase, β-galactosidase, lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase activities. Furthermore, targeted LC-MS/MS analysis focusing on glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the TCA cycle intermediates was performed to assess metabolic alterations. Exposure to pharmaceuticals resulted in the changes in activity for several enzymes of metabolism and the detoxification enzyme glutathione-S-transferase. Metabolic perturbations on key pathways revealed distinct groups and metabolic fingerprints for the different exposures and their mixtures. Chronic exposure to pharmaceuticals at low concentrations revealed significant alterations of metabolic and physiological endpoints.},

We hypothesized that population genetic structure measures will be influenced by the biological traits of organisms. Data were pulled from public databases, as well as taxon-specific literature. The R pipeline includes fifteen modules that can be adapted and applied to a diverse set of animal groups, geographic regions, genes, and traits. Habitat, larval diet, geographical distance, latitude, and longitude were all significantly related to population genetic structure in Diptera.

A trophic cascade triggered by the invasion of the predatory zooplankter spiny water flea (Bythotrephes cederstromii) resulted in increased phytoplankton due to decreased zooplankton grazing. Here, we show that increased phytoplankton biomass led to an increase in lake anoxia. The temporal and spatial extent of anoxia experienced a step change increase coincident with the invasion. Anoxia was driven by phytoplankton biomass and stratification changes, and anoxic factor increased by 10 days. In particular, anoxia established more quickly following spring stratification. A shift in spring phytoplankton phenology encompassed both abundance and community composition. Diatoms (Bacillaryophyta) drove the increase in spring phytoplankton biomass, but not all phytoplankton community members increased, shifting the community composition. We infer that increased phytoplankton biomass increased labile organic matter and drove hypolimnetic oxygen consumption. These results demonstrate how a species invasion can shift lake phenology and biogeochemistry.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Footnotes* https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7570133},

The virus has shown the ability to adapt to a wide range of hosts, so the question of the possible involvement of aquafauna and animals of coastal ecosystems in maintaining its circulation remains open. Methods: the aim of this work was to study the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 for cells of freshwater fish and reptiles, including those associated with aquatic and coastal ecosystems, and the effect of ambient temperature on this process. In a continuous cell culture FHM (fathead minnow) and diploid fibroblasts CGIB (silver carp), SARS-CoV-2 replication was not maintained at either 25 °C or 29 °C. At 29 °C, the continuous cell culture TH-1 (eastern box turtle) showed high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, comparable to Vero E6 (development of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) and an infectious titer of 7.5 ± 0.17 log10 TCID50/mL on day 3 after infection), and primary fibroblasts CNI (Nile crocodile embryo) showed moderate susceptibility (no CPE, infectious titer 4.52 ± 0.14 log10 TCID50/mL on day 5 after infection). At 25 °C, SARS-CoV-2 infection did not develop in TH-1 and CNI. Conclusions: our results show the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to effectively replicate without adaptation in the cells of certain reptile species when the ambient temperature rises.},

	abstract = {Plastic-based contamination has become a major cause of concern as it pervades many environments such as air, water, sediments, and soils. This study sought to examine the presence of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in freshwater mussels placed at rainfall/street runoff overflows, downstream (15 km) of the city centre of Montréal, and 8 km downstream of a municipal effluent dispersion plume. MPs and NPs were determined using flow cytometry and size exclusion chromatography using fluorescence detection. Following 3 months of exposure during the summer season, mussels contained elevated amounts of both MPs and NPs. The rainfall overflow and downstream of the city centre were the most contaminated sites. Lipid peroxidation, metallothioneins, and protein aggregates (amyloids) were significantly increased at the most contaminated sites and were significantly correlated with NPs in tissues. Based on the levels of MPs and NPs in mussels exposed to municipal effluent, wastewater treatment plants appear to mitigate plastic contamination albeit not completely. In conclusion, the data support the hypothesis that mussels placed in urbanized areas are more contaminated by plastics, which are associated with oxidative damage. The highest responses observed at the overflow site suggest that tire wear and/or asphalt (road) erosion MPs/NPs represent important sources of contamination for the aquatic biota.},

	abstract = {R-type lectins are a widespread group of sugar-binding proteins found in nearly all domains of life, characterized by the presence of a carbohydrate-binding domain that adopts a β-trefoil fold. Mytilectins represent a recently described subgroup of β-trefoil lectins, which have been functionally characterized in a few mussel species (Mollusca, Bivalvia) and display attractive properties, which may fuel the development of artificial lectins with different biotechnological applications. The detection of different paralogous genes in mussels, together with the description of orthologous sequences in brachiopods, supports the formal description of mytilectins as a gene family. However, to date, an investigation of the taxonomic distribution of these lectins and their molecular diversification and evolution was still lacking. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the evolutionary history of mytilectins, revealing an ancient monophyletic evolutionary origin and a very broad but highly discontinuous taxonomic distribution, ranging from heteroscleromorphan sponges to ophiuroid and crinoid echinoderms. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of mytilectins display a chimera-like architecture, which combines the β-trefoil carbohydrate recognition domain with a C-terminal pore-forming domain, suggesting that the simpler structure of most functionally characterized mytilectins derives from a secondary domain loss.},

This review summarizes the reports on various HABs that are able to bring about marine fish kills. The predominant HABs, their toxins, and their effects on fishes spread across various parts of the globe are discussed. The mechanism of HAB-driven fish kills is discussed based on the available reports, and existing mitigation methods are presented. Lapses in the large-scale implementation of mitigation methods demonstrated under laboratory conditions are projected. Clay-related technologies and nano-sorption-based nanotechnologies, although proven to make significant contributions, have not been put to use in real-world conditions. The gaps in the technology transfer of the accomplished mitigation prototypes are highlighted.

	abstract = {The first ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) in Portugal dates from 2008 when 11 people reported CFP symptoms after consuming a 30 kg amberjack caught around the Selvagens Islands (Madeira Archipelago). Since then, 49 human poisonings have been reported. The emergence of a new threat challenged scientists and regulators, as methods for toxic microalgae analyses and ciguatoxin (CTX) detection were not implemented. To minimise the risk of ciguatera, the Madeira Archipelago authorities interdicted fisheries in Selvagens Islands and banned the capture of amberjacks weighing more than 10 kg in the entire region of Madeira Archipelago. The accurate identification and quantification of the benthic toxin-producing algae species spreading to new areas require efforts in terms of both microscopy and molecular techniques. Two ciguatera-causing dinoflagellates, Gambierdiscus excentricus and Gambierdiscus australes, were identified in the Madeira Island and Selvagens sub-archipelago, respectively. Regarding the CTX analysis (N2a cell-based assay and LC-MS) in fish, the results indicate that the Selvagens Islands are a ciguatera risk area and that fish vectoring CTX are not limited to top predator species. Nevertheless, advances and improvements in screening methods for the fast detection of toxicity in seafood along with certified reference material and sensitive and selective targeted analytical methods for the determination of CTX content are still pending. This study aims to revise the occurrence of ciguatera cases in the Madeira Archipelago since its first detection in 2008, to discuss the risk management strategy that was implemented, and to provide a summary of the available data on the bioaccumulation of CTX in marine fish throughout the marine food web, taking into consideration their ecological significance, ecosystem dynamics, and fisheries relevance.},

We characterized 14 drinking water reservoirs and their watersheds across the warming temperate/subtropical southeastern USA. Selected reservoirs had at least three years of accessible summer water quality data during 2010–2020, including Secchi depth, nutrients, and algal biomass as chlorophyll a, and depth profiles for temperature and dissolved oxygen. Most watersheds, including lands within a 10-km radius of the reservoirs, had sustained substantial urbanization and/or intensive industrialized animal production, in some cases including the discharge of partially treated human sewage or livestock slaughterhouse wastes near or into the reservoirs. Five reservoirs were assessed as mesotrophic; the others were eutrophic. Most were stratified, but ephemeral near-surface thermoclines were common, and many were too shallow (median depth 5.0 m) to maintain uniform temperatures in the relatively warm hypolimnia. Bottom-water hypoxia/anoxia occurred throughout the summers but, surprisingly, in 8 of 14 reservoirs hypoxia commonly extended to surface waters. In the Southeast as in many regions, drinking water reservoirs are poorly protected and degrading as livestock production and/or urban development increasingly characterize their watersheds. The eutrophication trajectory of these valuable resources should be used as an indicator of ecosystem health and water quality in developing more protective management and policy actions.},

Short-chained PFASs dominated aboveground tissues, whereas long-chained PFASs were most abundant in the plant roots. Our results showed that the presence or absence of exodermal Casparian strips, as well as the hydrophobicity and anion exchange capacities of PFASs, could explain the translocation of PFASs within plants. Significant associations found between accumulated PFAS concentrations and levels of gibberellins (GA1 and GA15), methionine, and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) imply potential effects of PFASs on plant development and growth. This study provides the first evidence of associations between PFAS accumulation in plants and growth hormone levels, possibly leading to growth reduction of the apical dome and effects on the cell cycle in pericycle cells and methionine metabolism in plants.},

	abstract = {The anthropogenic deterioration of aquatic ecosystems affects water resources due to agricultural malpractices, pollution from domestic septic tanks, recreational activities, and poor watershed management, among other factors. This study examines the management of Las Curias Reservoir, San Juan, Puerto Rico, after the 2016 arrival of the invasive aquatic fern Salvinia molesta. In September 2019, a community-led initiative introduced the Cyrtobagous salviniae weevil, an effective biological control agent for S. molesta, and commenced a mechanical removal campaign using an aquatic harvester. Limnological sampling (September 2019 to September 2022) and drone flights were employed to measure physicochemical and floating plant cover changes, respectively, in the reservoir. Monitoring of weevils in the reservoir demonstrated rapid establishment and dispersal, which resulted in visible damage including browning of plants and eventually sinking of entire mats. From 23 July 2019, the reservoir surface was predominantly covered by salvinia, occupying an area of 17.7 ha (100\% coverage). This coverage decreased to 12.6 ha (71\%) by 29 January 2021. By 12 August 2022, the coverage had been substantially reduced to just 1.1 ha, representing only 6\% of the reservoir surface. In 2022, the reservoir recorded an average dissolved oxygen concentration of 2.4 mg L−1 (±0.0, n = 144), the highest in the study period and indicative of ecosystem recovery. After three years of control efforts, dissolved oxygen, pH, and specific conductance returned to levels recorded prior to Salvinia molesta introduction. This ecosystem recovery, a first in Puerto Rico, could be attributed to early use of mechanical control and the long-term impact of biological control.},

	abstract = {Mytella strigata is a highly adaptable invasive alien species that has been established in coastal China since 2014. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is an important tool for studying the evolution and population genetics of invasive species. In this study, the mitochondrial genome of M. strigata from China was sequenced by Illumina high-throughput sequencing and characterized with 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs). By assessing the selective pressure of 13 PCGs, the nad2 gene had the fastest evolutionary rate and was finally selected for population genetic analysis. A total of 285 nad2 sequences from seven M. strigata populations in China were analyzed and showed obviously T-rich and C-rich characteristics. According to population genetic diversity analysis, all the seven populations had haplotype (gene) diversity (Hd) ≥ 0.5 and nucleotide diversity (Pi) {\textless} 0.005. Haplotype networks showed a “star” distribution. Population historical dynamic analyses showed that Fu’s Fs and Tajima’s D values of all populations were negative except the Qukou (QK) and Beihai (BH) populations. The Zhangzhou (ZJ) and Xiamen (XM) populations were unimodal while the other populations were multimodal. These results suggested that the population of M. strigata in China may have passed the bottleneck period and is currently in a state of population expansion.},

	abstract = {Cyanobacterial blooms (CYBs) have become a global environmental issue, posing risks to edible bivalves. Toxic cyanobacteria and thermal stress represent the two key co-occurring stressors to bivalves experiencing CYBs. To investigate the combined effects of these stressors on the edible bivalve Corbicula fluminea, the responses to oxidative stress and the molecular mechanisms of physiological adaptations in C. fluminea were examined under co-exposure to toxic Microcystis aeruginosa and thermal stress. The activity of antioxidant enzymes, including GST, SOD, CAT, GPx and GR, was significantly influenced by the interaction between temperature and M. aeruginosa (p {\textless} 0.05). A positive correlation was observed between toxic M. aeruginosa exposure and elevated SOD and GPx activities at 30 °C, demonstrating that SOD and GPx may help C. fluminea defend effectively against MCs under thermal stress. Furthermore, significant interactive effects between toxic M. aeruginosa and temperature were also observed in ROS and MDA (p {\textless} 0.05). The results of the PCA and IBR index also evidenced the apparent influence of toxic M. aeruginosa and thermal stress on oxidative stress responses of C. fluminea. The eggNOG and GO annotations confirmed that a substantial portion of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) exhibited associations with responses to oxidative stress and transporter activity. Additionally, KEGG analysis revealed that abundant DEGs were involved in pathways related to inflammatory responses, immune functions and metabolic functions. These findings improve our understanding of the mechanism of the physiological adaptation in bivalves in response to cyanotoxins under thermal conditions, potentially enabling the evaluation of the viability of using bivalves as a bioremediation tool to manage CYBs in eutrophic waters.},

It has been an object of scientific interest for over a century, but the most intense period of research started in 1997 and resulted in the production of numerous papers of a multidisciplinary range. The lake is especially well analyzed in terms of its sediments, which were studied using geophysical methods and using traditional lake cartography based on the sampling of sediments and their geochemical characterization. Nearly two decades of research has resulted in the extraction of over 1200 sediment samples, which facilitated the analysis and the description of five main sediment types that can be found at the bottom of Wigry Lake, i.e., carbonate gyttja, lacustrine chalk, clastic sediment, fluvial-lacustrine sediment, and organic gyttja. A very thorough vertical as well as spatial examination of Wigry Lake sediments, together with paleobiological research and isotopic dating, allowed researchers to analyze the history of environmental changes in the lake and its immediate vicinity, including anthropogenic changes. Wigry Lake had been preserved as a pristine lake for a long time, and, despite the significant growth of anthropopressure, which began in the 17th century and intensified in the 20th century, it retained its natural character to a large extent. This was possible mainly due to the favorable morphometry of the lake (large depth and capacity of the reservoir) and different forms of active and passive protection, introduced mainly after the establishment of the Wigry National Park in 1989.},

The present study investigated the effects of Cr6+ exposure on the tissue distribution, proximate composition, and histopathology of an aquatic mollusk, periwinkle (Littorina littorea). The animals were exposed to sublethal concentrations of Cr6+ (0.42, 0.84, and 4.2 mg/L) for 30 days. Exposure to Cr6+ resulted in changes in the proximate composition and histological architecture of L. littorea. There was a low potential for bioaccumulation of Cr6+ in the tissue of L. littorea. Thus, its consumption did not pose any serious health risks to humans.AbstractThe increased use of hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) in various industrial applications has contributed to its elevated levels in the environment, especially the aquatic environment. Thus, there is the potential for accumulation of Cr6+ in the tissues of aquatic organisms and consequent toxic effects. The toxic effects of Cr6+ in aquatic organisms have been widely reported; however, little is known about the patterns of tissue accumulation of Cr6+ and its toxicity in aquatic mollusks. Thus, the present study investigated the effects of Cr6+ exposure on the tissue distribution, proximate composition, and histopathology of an aquatic mollusk, periwinkle (Littorina littorea). The animals were exposed to sublethal concentrations of Cr6+ (0.42, 0.84, and 4.2 mg/L) for 30 days, after which the condition index, tissue accumulation, proximate composition, and histopathological effects were determined. The control animals were maintained in a medium that did not contain Cr6+ (0 mg/L). The condition index did not differ significantly among the groups. The levels of Cr6+ in the tissues differed significantly among the different tissue types while there was no significant effect of the exposure concentration, except in the foot tissue. The proximate parameters (protein, carbohydrates, lipid, crude fiber, and moisture contents) differed significantly among the groups. The protein contents of the exposed animals were significantly lower than those of the control animals and the histological architecture of the major organs was altered in the chromium-exposed animals. The findings from this study indicate a low potential of L. littorea to bioaccumulate Cr6+ in its tissues at the low exposure concentrations tested in this study; as such, its consumption may not pose any serious health risks to humans. However, changes in the proximate composition and histological architecture of the exposed L. littorea show that Cr6+ is potentially toxic to periwinkles.},

	abstract = {The present study was carried out within the MICROLIM project funded by the German Research Foundation DFG, which aims at an overall assessment of microplastic concentrations in different environmental compartments of the Lake Tollense catchment. Here, we address potential input sources of microplastic and their occurrence in the catchment and provide first estimates of emission volumes based on population density, agricultural activities and traffic. The land cover of the Lake Tollense catchment, located in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany, is dominated by agriculture and comprises the city of Neubrandenburg in the Northern part of the lake and additional minor settlements in the rural areas. The catchment area is divided into six sub-catchments according to the lake’s tributaries. The methodological approach comprised (1) a literature review of potential sources of microplastic, their potential composition, application approaches and possible effects on the environment, (2) the determination of land use types within the lake Tollense catchment via a descriptive land-use analysis and examination of the identified land-use types for the occurrence of microplastic-emitting applications according to the initial literature review and (3) a quantitative estimation of the emission volumes of the population (including tourists), transport and agricultural activities in the catchment area, applying specific emission rates. Potential microplastic emissions could be identified from urban agglomerations and the agricultural and transport sectors. The first quantifications of the emission potential of particulate matter in the size of 10 µm (PM10) from the transport sector resulted in an average of 14.5 tons per year on state and federal roads. The total annual emission volume of the population in the study area is estimated at an average of 138.6 tons per year. The calculated volumes of particulate emissions from roads and traffic indicate that transport is the most important emission source in the Lake Tollense catchment area.},

	abstract = {Pheromones play a vital role in regulating fish behavior, including reproduction, aggregation, hazard recognition and food location. To gain a better understanding of chemical communication in fish produced by density changes, this study analyzed the metabolites released by turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) under different stocking densities. The experiment was conducted at low (LD: 3.01 kg/m2), medium (MD: 6.62 kg/m2) and high (HD: 10.84 kg/m2) densities for 15 days. High-throughput non-targeted metabolomics (LC-MS/MS) was used to identify variations in metabolites released into the aquatic environment by turbot at different densities. Results showed that 29 and 47 metabolites were significantly upregulated in the MD and HD groups, respectively, compared with the LD group. Among them, hexadecanedioic acid, xanthine, phenethylamine, proline and styrene were significantly upregulated in the MD vs. LD, HD vs. MD and HD vs. LD. The VIP diagram of OPLS-DA alignment showed that phenethylamine was the most important metabolite shared by MD vs. LD, HD vs. MD and HD vs. LD. Key gene changes in the GH/IGF-1 signaling pathway, HPI axis of turbot were studied using qRT-PCR for density treatment. The results demonstrated that the expression of GH, GHR and IGF-1 was significantly lower, while the expression of CRH and ACTH was higher in the HD group. Additionally, plasma levels of cortisol, glucose, triglycerides and T3 were also highest in the HD group compared with the LD and MD groups. Phenylethylamine concentration was positively correlated with the HPI axis and negatively correlated with the GH/IGF-1 signaling pathway. To investigate the impact of phenethylamine accumulation on turbot, an acute treatment experiment with phenethylamine was set up. Its concentration in the aquatic environment was set at 0 (CON), 10−7 (LP) and 10−5 (HP) mol/L via exogenous addition, and turbot were exposed to these environments for 2 days. There was a high degree of concordance between the GH/IGF-1 signaling pathway (GH, GHR, IGF-1), HPI axis (CRH, ACTH) and plasma physiological changes (cortisol, glucose, triglycerides, T3) in the phenethylamine-treated group and the density-treated group. Therefore, accumulation of phenethylamine with increasing stocking density may be a potential cause of density stress. Phenylethylamine has a dose-dependent and trace effect as a pheromone.},

	abstract = {Simple SummarySerotonin (5-HT) is a highly effective oxytocin widely used in aquaculture. However, the role of 5-HT in mollusks remains unclear. Limited research has been conducted on the structures of 5-HT receptor genes, particularly those associated with ovulatory function. In this study, 5-HT receptors were screened and characterized in the whole genome of Sinonovacula constricta. Some 5-HT-binding receptors had been tentatively identified, and their expression pattern exhibited a circadian rhythm. The findings will contribute to a deeper comprehension of the biological role of 5-HT in bivalve ovulation induction and enhance the investigation into its molecular mechanism.AbstractSerotonin (5-HT) is primarily distributed in the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems, where it plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological functions such as digestion, reproduction and establishing animal emotions. 5-HT is an effective oxytocin widely used in molluscan aquaculture, and its physiological functions are performed by binding to corresponding 5-HT receptors (5-HTRs). In this study, seven 5-HTR genes of Sinonovacula constricta (Sc5-HTRs) were identified and analyzed, and they were designated as Sc5-HT1A, Sc5-HT1D, Sc5-HT2-1, Sc5-HT2-2, Sc5-HT2-3, Sc5-HT4 and Sc5-HT6. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the seven Sc5-HTRs were conserved among mollusks, and the Sc5-HTRs were all transmembrane proteins. The seven Sc5-HTR genes were distributed on chromosome 1, 2, 13 and 14. After injecting 5-HT, there was a significant increase in mRNA expression levels of Sc5-HT1A (p {\textless} 0.05) and Sc5-HT2-3 (p {\textless} 0.01), while Sc5-HT4 decreased significantly (p {\textless} 0.01) compared to control groups which might be effective 5-HT receptors. Furthermore, two of the receptors (Sc5-HT2-3 and Sc5-HT4) were expressed in the circadian rhythm patterns, indicating their potential influence on the nocturnal spawning of S. constricta. Overall, these findings provide a theoretical basis for understanding the structures and functions of 5-HTR gene family members, and may facilitate the artificial propagation of mollusks.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryTo clarify the specific nutritional needs for ovary maturation of the commercially important crab Portunus trituberculatus, we compared the biochemical composition of the ovary, hepatopancreas, and muscle at five ovarian developmental stages, and also analyzed their relation to the ovarian developmental stage of P. trituberculatus. We found that the branched-chain amino acids, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, and monounsaturated fatty acids accumulated in the ovary and hepatopancreas, and positively correlated with the ovary maturation stage. Also, we found an increasing tendency of carotenoid and phosphatidylcholine in phospholipid from the pre-developmental stage to the proliferative stage in the ovary, but not in the hepatopancreas and muscle, indicating their crucial role for oocyte development. Our study suggests the involvement of these compositions in the broodstock diet, which will promote the ovarian maturation of adult P. trituberculatus and ensure high-quality larval production.AbstractThe swimming crab Portunus trituberculatus is one of the most important economic species in China and its mature ovary often determines its commercial value and production. Although the ovary maturation of crustaceans is generally affected by exogenous nutrition, the specific nutritional needs of ovary maturation of P. trituberculatus are poorly understood. To this end, we collected the P. trituberculatus samples with five ovarian maturation stages and measured their biochemical composition of the ovary, hepatopancreas, and muscle at each ovarian developmental stage. We further analyzed their relation to the ovarian developmental stage of P. trituberculatus by principal components analysis (PCA). We found the levels of branched-chain amino acids, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA), and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) in the ovary and hepatopancreas increased during the ovary maturation process, and also passively correlated with ovarian developmental stage, which highlights the necessity of these specific nutrients for oogenesis and for improving the nutrient quality of crabs. In addition, we found an increasing tendency of carotenoid content and phosphatidylcholine in phospholipid in the ovary from the pre-developmental stage to the proliferative stage, but not in the hepatopancreas and muscle, which highlights the possible involvement of carotenoids during the rapid oocyte development process. Our study may provide valuable information for developing a suitable broodstock diet that promotes the ovarian maturation of adult P. trituberculatus and ensures high-quality larval production.},

	abstract = {Thiamine (vitamin B1) is required by all living organisms in multiple metabolic pathways. It is scarce in natural systems, and deficiency can lead to reproductive failure, neurological issues, and death. One major cause of thiamine deficiency is an overreliance on diet items containing the enzyme thiaminase. Thiaminase activity has been noted in many prey fishes and linked to cohort failure in salmonid predators that eat prey fish with thiaminase activity, yet it is generally unknown whether evolutionary history, fish traits, and/or environmental conditions lead to production of thiaminase. We conducted literature and GenBank BLAST sequence searches to collect thiaminase activity data and sequence homology data in expressed protein sequences for 300 freshwater and marine fishes. We then tested whether presence or absence of thiaminase could be predicted by evolutionary relationships, trophic level, omega-3 fatty acid concentrations, habitat, climate, invasive potential, and body size. There was no evolutionary relationship with thiaminase activity. It first appears in Class Actinoptergyii (bony ray-finned fishes) and is present across the entire Actinoptergyii phylogeny in both primitive and derived fish orders. Instead, ecological factors explained the most variation in thiaminase: fishes were more likely to express thiaminase if they fed closer to the base of the food web, were high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, lived in freshwater, and were from tropical climates. These data provide a foundation for understanding sources of thiaminase leading to thiamine deficiency in fisheries and other organisms, including humans that eat uncooked fish.},

Here we present evidence of the feasibility of sensing plastics in water using hyperspectral near-infrared to shortwave-infrared imaging techniques. We captured hyperspectral images of nine polymers submerged to four depths (2.5–15 mm) in water using a hyperspectral imaging system that utilizes near-infrared to shortwave-infrared light sources. We also developed algorithms to predict the reflectance spectra of each polymer in water using the spectra of the dry plastics and water as independent variables in a multiple linear regression model after a logarithmic transformation. A narrow 1100–1300 nm wavelength range was advantageous for detection of polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride in water down to the 160–320 µm size range, while a wider 970–1670 nm wavelength range was beneficial for polypropylene reflectance spectrum prediction in water. Furthermore, we found that the spectra of the other five polymers, comprising polycarbonate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, phenol formaldehyde, polyacetal, and polymethyl methacrylate, could also be predicted within their respective optimized wavelength ranges. Our findings provide fundamental information for direct sensing of plastics in water on both benchtop and airborne platforms.},

This is because increasing pollution is causing fundamental changes to the welfare of animals and the marine ecosystem. A primary focus is on the impact of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs), as evidenced by our bibliometric network analysis (BNA). However, while research is focused on the accumulation of these pollutants in aquatic organisms, their effects on redox homeostasis are still seldom discussed despite the role played by reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial well-being in maintaining an optimal state of health. However, some scientific evidence suggests that the accumulation of MPs and NPs in organisms at the base of the trophic chain can cause a transfer of these substances towards more complex organisms, reaching humans through the consumption of aquatic fauna as food. Therefore, in this review, we have tried to discuss the effects of these substances on oxidative stress in aquatic organisms, even if studies in this regard are still scarce.},

To identify the functional genes affecting gonad development in M. unguiculatus, the transcriptome of gonads in mussels stimulated by shade-drying and those not stimulated were compared. Differential gene expression analysis revealed that there were 22 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the testis and 70 DEGs in the ovary among the experimental groups. KEGG enrichment analysis identified a total of 11 pathways that might be related to environmental stimuli affecting gonadal development. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), the cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR), hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 (HCRTR2), and gamma-aminobutyric acid type B receptor (GABBR) were highly expressed in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway, indicating that these genes might be involved in the transduction of environmental information that stimulates gonadal development. Meanwhile, nuclear receptor co-repressor 2 (NCoR2) was highly expressed in the notch signaling pathway, indicating that NCoR2 might be involved in the regulation of gonad development. To validate the transcriptome data, we selected five DEGs in the KEGG signaling pathway, including AChRs, CCKAR, HCRTR2, GABAB, and NCoR2, for real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), which produced results consistent with the RNA-Seq data. The transcriptome analysis and gene pathway identification in this study have enhanced our comprehension of the reproductive mechanisms in M. unguiculatus.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryInternal loading can significantly delay the improvement of eutrophication in lakes. When external nutrient inputs are controlled and internal loading intensifies, the dissolved oxygen condition at the water-sediment interface improves during non-algal bloom seasons, but more anaerobic conditions occur during algal bloom seasons. Macroinvertebrates, living at the water-sediment interface, are particularly sensitive to such changes. Our results indicate that, in large shallow Lake Taihu, the changes in dissolved oxygen conditions at the water-sediment interface, caused by intensified internal loading, significantly affect the community structure, diversity, and response to eutrophication of macroinvertebrates.AbstractIn eutrophic lakes, even if external loading is controlled, internal nutrient loading delays the recovery of lake eutrophication. When the input of external pollutants is reduced, the dissolved oxygen environment at the sediment interface improves in a season without algal blooms. As an important part of lake ecosystems, macroinvertebrates are sensitive to hypoxia caused by eutrophication; however, how this change affects macroinvertebrates is still unknown. In this study, we analysed the monitoring data of northern Lake Taihu from 2007 to 2019. After 2007, the external loading of Lake Taihu was relatively stable, but eutrophication began to intensify after 2013, and the nutrients in the sediments also began to decline, which was related to the efficient use of nutrients by algal blooms. The community structure and population density of macroinvertebrates showed different responses in different stages. In particular, the density of oligochaetes and the Shannon–Wiener index showed significant differences in their response to different stages, and their sensitivity to eutrophication was significantly reduced. Under eutrophication conditions dominated by internal loading, frequent hypoxia occurs at the sediment interface only when an algal bloom erupts. When there is no bloom, the probability of sediment hypoxia is significantly reduced under the disturbance of wind. Our results indicate that the current method for evaluating lake eutrophication based on oligochaetes and the Shannon–Wiener diversity index may lose its sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Flow control flushing water from reservoirs has been imposed in South Korea for mitigating harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CyanoHABs) in rivers. This measure, however, can cause water shortage in reservoirs, as the measure adopting this flow control may require an additional amount of water which exceeds the water demand allocated to the reservoirs. In terms of sustainability, a trade-off between improving water quality and alleviating water shortage needs to be considered. This study aimed at establishing a practical framework for a decision support system for optimal joint operation of the upstream reservoirs (Andong and Imha) to reduce the frequency of CyanoHABs in the Nakdong River, South Korea. Methodologically, three models were introduced: (1) a machine learning model (accuracy 88\%) based on the k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor) algorithm to predict the occurrence of CyanoHABs at a selected downstream location (the Chilgok Weir located approximately 140 km downstream from the Andong Dam), (2) a multiobjective optimization model employing NSGA-II (Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) to determine both the quantity and quality of water released from the reservoirs, and (3) a river water quality model (R2 0.79) using HEC-RAS to simulate the water quality parameter at Chilgok Weir according to given upstream boundary conditions. The applicability of the framework was demonstrated by simulation results using observational data from 2015 to 2019. The simulation results based on the framework confirmed that the frequency of CyanoHABs would be decreased compared with the number of days when CyanoHABs were observed at Chilgok Weir. This framework, with a combination of several models, is a novelty in terms of efficiency, and it can be a part of a solution to the problem of CyanoHABs without using an additional amount of water from a reservoir.},

This study aimed to quantify adenine nucleotides in the stygophilous freshwater amphipod Synurella ambulans and to evaluate the potential of adenylate energy charge (AEC) as a physiological biomarker of general stress in the HZ of the Sava River at sites with different intensities of environmental and anthropogenic stress. Field studies were conducted seasonally (in December 2018 and April, July, and October 2019) at two sampling sites, one upstream (1-UP) and the other downstream (2-DOWN) of the discharge from the wastewater treatment plant using the standard piston pump. The amphipod population from site 1-UP had significantly higher AEC values than the population from site 2-DOWN in all seasons except summer. Coordinated changes in AEC values with the ATP/ADP ratio indicated differences in energy status between the two populations. However, no changes in the apparent equilibrium constant of adenylate kinase were observed, except in spring at site 1-UP. Multiple linear regression models showed the strongest associations of AEC with Fe and Zn accumulated in amphipods, followed by environmental factors (conductivity, dissolved O2, and concentrations of nitrites and phosphates in the interstitial water). AEC was shown to be a useful index of environmental stress in S. ambulans because it can directly measure the change in available energy and thus the metabolic stress to which the organism is exposed. Finally, seasonal and spatial variations in AEC values reflected ecological status in the HZ.},

This study aimed to monitor SARS-CoV-2 RNA presence in 168 raw wastewater samples collected from six wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and 57 mollusk samples obtained from eight harvesting sites in Campania, Italy. The monitoring period spanned from October 2021 to April 2022, and the results were compared and correlated with the epidemiological situation. In sewage, the ORF1b region of SARS-CoV-2 was detected using RT-qPCR, while in mollusks, three targets—RdRp, ORF1b, and E—were identified via RT-dPCR. Results showed a 92.3\% rate of positive wastewater samples with increased genomic copies (g.c.)/(day*inhabitant) in December–January and March–April 2022. In the entire observation period, 54.4\% of mollusks tested positive for at least one SARS-CoV-2 target, and the rate of positive samples showed a trend similar to that of the wastewater samples. The lower SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate in bivalve mollusks compared to sewages is a direct consequence of the seawater dilution effect. Our data confirm that both sample types can be used as sentinels to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the environment and suggest their potential use in obtaining complementary information on SARS-CoV-2.},

In this study, we investigated the adverse effects that could occur from pure polyethylene (PE) MPs and PE contaminated with phenanthrene (Phe) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) in D. magna and podocopid ostracods. The organisms were exposed to different sizes (1–5, 27–32, 45–53, and 212–250 μm) and concentrations of MPs (0, 16, 160, 1600, 16,000 particles/mL) using a static and dynamic model of exposition. The results indicate that both daphnia and ostracods can ingest MPs, and the effect observed in most cases is directly proportional to the concentration of MPs. Exposure to pure MP did not affect the organisms. However, at 21 days, they induced a significant decrease (p {\textless} 0.05) in neonatal daphnia compared to the control. MP + CPF negatively affected the crustaceans when concentration, and exposure time were increased and when the size of the MPs was decreased. Neonatal daphnia were the most sensitive compared to juveniles and adults. MP + Phe caused mortality when increasing the concentration of MPs and in D. magna juveniles with increasing size, while in ostracods, mortality increased with decreasing particle size. The effect of the MPs in crustaceans would depend on the concentration, exposure time, size of the organisms, and size of the MPs. It is also shown that the toxicity of PE increases when these particles are associated with a contaminant, which would indicate its role as a transporter of organic contaminants.},

	abstract = {Metallic trace elements toxicity has been associated with a wide range of morphological abnormalities in fish, both in natural aquatic ecosystems and controlled environments. The bioaccumulation of metallic trace elements can have devastating effects on several aspects of fish health, encompassing physiological, reproductive, behavioural, and developmental functions. Considering the significant risks posed by metallic trace elements-induced toxicity to fish populations, this review aims to investigate the deleterious effects of prevalent metallic trace elements toxicants, such as mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), and copper (Cu), on the neurological, reproductive, embryonic, and tissue systems of fish. Employing diverse search engines and relevant keywords, an extensive review of in vitro and in vivo studies pertaining to metallic trace elements toxicity and its adverse consequences on fish and their organs was conducted. The findings indicate that Cd was the most prevalent metallic trace elements in aquatic environments, exerting the most severe impacts on various fish organs and systems, followed by Cu and Pb. Moreover, it was observed that different metals exhibited varying degrees and types of effects on fish. Given the profound adverse effects of metallic trace elements contamination in water, immediate measures need to be taken to mitigate water pollution stemming from the discharge of waste containing metallic trace elements from agricultural, industrial, and domestic water usage. This study also compares the most common methods for treating metallic trace elements contamination in water.},

Concentrations of Cd, Pb, Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Mg, and Kwere determined in the muscles, liver, and gonads sabrefish from Rybinsk Reservoir areas with different anthropogenic loads. The tissue samples were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry. Heavy metals accumulated more intensively in the body of fish from more polluted areas of the reservoir. Among the analyzed elements, the maximum accumulation levels were found for K, Zn, and Fe and the minimum levels were observed for Cd and Pb. The gonads contained the largest concentration of Cd and Mn, the muscles contained the highest concentrations of Mg, and the other elements mainly accumulated in the liver of sabrefish. The THQ and HI values for all elements did not exceed 1, which suggests that there is no potential non-carcinogenic risk to human health. The target values of carcinogenic risk (TR) for cadmium ranged from 8.32 × 10−6 to 1.22 × 10−4 in the muscles. The increased content of cadmium in the gonads of sabrefish not only poses a risk to human health, but also to the reproduction of this species in the Rybinsk Reservoir.},

	abstract = {The current climate change scenario caused by anthropogenic activities has resulted in novel environmental pressures, increasing the occurrence and severity of fungal infections in the marine environment. Research on fungi in several taxonomic groups is widespread although not the case for elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). In this context, the aim of the present study was to screen the oral fungal microbiota present in artisanally captured Rioraja agassizii, a batoid that, although endangered, is highly fished and consumed worldwide. Oropharyngeal samples were obtained by swabbing and the samples were investigated using morphological and phenotypic methods by streaking on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) and subculturing onto CHROMagar Candida (BD Difco) and CHROMagar Candida Plus (CHROMagarTM), as well as molecular techniques by amplification of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal DNA region and a MALDI-TOF MS assessment. The findings indicated the presence of Candida parapsilosis (seven isolates), Candida duobushaemulonii (one isolate) and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa (three isolates), several of these reported for the first time in Rioraja agassizii. In addition, a 100\% agreement between the MALDI-TOF results and partial ITS region sequencing was noted, demonstrating that the MALDI-TOF MS is a rapid and effective alternative for yeast identification in Rioraja agassizii isolates and potentially in other elasmobranch species. These findings highlight the need for further research to determine the potential impact on elasmobranch health, ecology, and commercial fisheries. Furthermore, this research is paramount in a One Health framework and may be employed to predict elasmobranch responses to an evolving ocean, keep healthy populations in check, monitor species, and assess the public health consequences of consuming these species.},

	abstract = {The marine environment is a rich source of bioactive compounds. Therefore, the sea cucumber was isolated from the Red Sea at the Al-Ain Al-Sokhna coast and it was identified as surf redfish (Actinopyga mauritiana). The aqueous extract of the surf redfish was utilized as an ecofriendly, novel and sustainable approach to fabricate zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs). The biosynthesized ZnO-NPs were physico-chemically characterized and evaluated for their possible antibacterial and insecticidal activities. Additionally, their safety in the non-target organism model (Nile tilapia fish) was also investigated. ZnO-NPs were spherical with an average size of 24.69 ± 11.61 nm and had a peak at 350 nm as shown by TEM and UV-Vis, respectively. XRD analysis indicated a crystalline phase of ZnO-NPs with an average size of 21.7 nm. The FTIR pattern showed biological residues from the surf redfish extract, highlighting their potential role in the biosynthesis process. DLS indicated a negative zeta potential (−19.2 mV) of the ZnO-NPs which is a good preliminary indicator for their stability. ZnO-NPs showed larvicidal activity against mosquito Culex pipiens (LC50 = 15.412 ppm and LC90 = 52.745 ppm) and a potent adulticidal effect to the housefly Musca domestica (LD50 = 21.132 ppm and LD90 = 84.930 ppm). Tested concentrations of ZnO-NPs showed strong activity against the 3rd larval instar. Topical assays revealed dose-dependent adulticidal activity against M. domestica after 24 h of treatment with ZnO-NPs. ZnO-NPs presented a wide antibacterial activity against two fish-pathogen bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophila. Histopathological and hematological investigations of the non-target organism, Nile tilapia fish exposed to 75–600 ppm ZnO-NPs provide dose-dependent impacts. Overall, data highlighted the potential applications of surf redfish-mediated ZnO-NPs as an effective and safe way to control mosquitoes, houseflies and fish pathogenic bacteria.},

Further, as they are connected via water channels or small crevices in bedrock, we defined the Vjetrenica Cave System as a system comprising Vjetrenica and Bjelušica Caves and Lukavac Spring. Altogether, 93 troglobiotic, i.e., obligate subterranean aquatic (48) and terrestrial (45), taxa were reported for the system, verifying the Vjetrenica Cave System as the second richest locality in subterranean biodiversity in the world. The global uniqueness of the system is also reflected in the fact that as many as 40 troglobiotic species were described from the system. Finally, we reviewed the factors endangering this unique subterranean community and questioned whether it will withstand human-induced changes and pressures due to infrastructural development in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina.},

	abstract = {Cosmetics have always been in demand across the globe among people of all age groups. In the modern cosmetic world, nanostructured materials have proven hugely advantageous in producing cosmeceuticals or ‘nano-cosmeceuticals’ and various beauty products. The application of nanostructured materials in cosmetic products possesses some challenges in terms of short- and long-term safety and environmental issues, despite their growing popularity. The nanostructured particles in cosmeceuticals provide a targeted route of administration due to their high penetrability, site selectivity, high effectiveness, prolonged activity, and drug encapsulation potential. However, standard methods for toxicity evaluation may not be relevant for cosmeceuticals, leading to the need for an alternative methodology. This review article compiles detailed descriptions of all significant aspects of nanostructured materials in the cosmetics industry, which include the synthesis and characterization of relevant nanostructured materials for cosmeceuticals, state-of-the-art practices, mechanisms for the synthesis of advanced materials, toxicological concerns in terms of health risks in humans, and environmental concerns. Also, a proposal for new approaches in terms of regulatory measures to mitigate these problems has been suggested. The primary focus of this article is to provide a comprehensive outlook on this subject area and contribute to the exploration of new prospects and emerging roles of nanostructured materials in the cosmetics industry.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryThe formation of primordial germ cells (PGCs) is the basis of molluskan reproduction, but limited information is reported on this topic. PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain-containing proteins (PRDMs), especially PRDM1 (also known as BLIMP1) and PRDM14, have been reported to be essential for the formation of PGCs. In this study, we systematically characterized the putative PRDMs in a bivalve mollusk species, Mulinia lateralis, and analyzed their sequence structures, phylogenetic relationships, and expressional profiles. Furthermore, we analyzed the temporal–spatial expression patterns of Ml-prdm1 and Ml-prdm14 RNA in early embryos and larvae. Our study suggests that Ml-prdm1 may function as an important regulator of PGC formation in M. lateralis.AbstractMollusca represents one of the ancient bilaterian groups with high morphological diversity, while the formation mechanisms of the precursors of all germ cells, primordial germ cells (PGCs), have not yet been clarified in mollusks. PRDI-BF1 and RIZ homology domain-containing proteins (PRDMs) are a group of transcriptional repressors, and PRDM1 (also known as BLIMP1) and PRDM14 have been reported to be essential for the formation of PGCs. In the present study, we performed a genome-wide retrieval in Mulinia lateralis and identified 11 putative PRDMs, all of which possessed an N-terminal PR domain. Expressional profiles revealed that all these prdm genes showed specifically high expression levels in the given stages, implying that all PRDMs played important roles during early development stages. Specifically, Ml-prdm1 was highly expressed at the gastrula stage, the key period when PGCs arise, and was specifically localized in the cytoplasm of two or three cells of blastula, gastrula, or trochophore larvae, matching the typical characteristics of PGCs. These results suggested that Ml-prdm1-positive cells may be PGCs and that Ml-prdm1 could be a candidate marker for tracing the formation of PGCs in M. lateralis. In addition, the expression profiles of Ml-prdm14 hinted that it may not be associated with PGCs of M. lateralis. The present study provides insights into the evolution of the PRDM family in mollusks and offers a better understanding of the formation of PGCs in mollusks.},

This study aims to survey the presence of the main human-pathogenic microsporidia in digestive samples of edible marine fish in the Comunidad Valenciana, Spain. For this purpose, 138 farmed fish and 113 wild fish from commercial fishing were simultaneously tested using a specific polymerase chain reaction assay. We detected, for the first time, the presence of the zoonotic species Encephalitozoon intestinalis/hellem in both studied fish groups, together with the presence of microsporidia from the family Enterocytozoonidae. In marine fish, E. intestinalis/hellem suggests a potential risk for public health. However, additional studies in the characterization and epidemiology of these pathogenic microsporidia species in fish are necessary.AbstractMicrosporidia are widely spread obligate intracellular fungal pathogens from vertebrate and invertebrate organisms, mainly transmitted by contaminated food and water. This study aims to detect the presence of major human-pathogenic microsporidia, i.e., Enterocytozoon bieneusi, Encephalitozoon intestinalis, Encephalitozoon hellem, and Encephalitozoon cuniculi, in the gastrointestinal tract of commercially harvested marine fish from Mediterranean coast of the Comunidad Valenciana, Eastern Spain. A total of 251 fish, 138 farmed fish and 113 wild fish from commercial fishing were tested by SYBR Green real-time PCR, enabling the simultaneous detection of the four targeted species. E. intestinalis/hellem was found in 1.45\% of farmed fish and 7.96\% of wild fish, while Enterocytozoonidae was detected in 2.90\% and 18.58\% of farmed and wild fish, respectively. E. cuniculi was not detected in any of the analyzed specimens. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first report of E. intestinalis/hellem in fish, particularly in marine fish. Although the role of fish in these species’ epidemiology remains unknown, this finding points out a potential public health risk linked to fish consumption. Further studies are necessary to characterize these microsporidia in fish hosts better and to elucidate their epidemiological role.},

In response, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) and the Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research (CIGLR) created an annual sampling program to detect, monitor, assess, and predict HABs in western Lake Erie (WLE). Here we describe the data collected from this monitoring program from 2012 to 2021. This dataset includes observations on physicochemical properties, major nutrient fractions, phytoplankton pigments, microcystins, and optical properties for western Lake Erie. This dataset is particularly relevant for creating models, verifying and calibrating remote sensing algorithms, and informing experimental research to further understand the water quality dynamics that influence HABs in this internationally significant body of freshwater.

	abstract = {In everyday life, humans rely on working memory (WM) processes to make sense of relationships between linguistic elements that are not linearly adjacent. For example, to understand the sentence The dog that the cat chased is cute, we encode the referent the dog into WM, maintain and retrieve it after reading the verb chased in order to interpret the dog as the object of chased. Increased grammatical complexity of the sentence has been shown to increase the effort needed to retrieve the target representation (Gibson, 1998; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005). In this dissertation, I focus on how changing the properties of the target representation - its complexity and internal coherence - affects the effort needed for the three WM processes, especially the under-studied maintenance process. Understanding this interaction can help inform our understanding of how humans package and store linguistic units in WM and better characterize WM architecture during sentence comprehension. To give a multi-dimensional view of the impact on WM processes, I approached the question from both behavioral and neural perspectives. Furthermore, through EEG experiments, I examined the role of the Sustained Anterior Negativity (SAN) in maintenance during sentence comprehension.Chapters 2 and 3 investigate how encoding, maintenance and retrieval of complex noun phrase (NP) representations differ from those of their simple counterparts through both a behavioral and neural lens, respectively. Through self-paced reading experiments in Chapter 2, I demonstrate that while the effects of representational complexity on encoding and retrieval were inconsistent, having a complex target NP always facilitated maintenance. This facilitation results from two factors: increased distinctiveness of the complex representations leading to decreased vulnerability to interference, and increased activation level due to increased encoding effort. Chapter 3 describes an EEG experiment that followed up the behavioral experiments in Chapter 2. Previous works (Fiebach et al., 2002; King and Kutas, 1995; Phillips et al., 2005) found the SAN when there was increased processing cost during maintenance. In this EEG experiment, the sentences with simple NPs elicited a sustained global negativity relative to sentences with complex NPs during maintenance, giving evidence that increased representational complexity of the target NP decreases maintenance effort.Chapter 4 investigates how the encoding, maintenance and retrieval of internally coherent NP representations differ from those of their incoherent counterparts using both behavioral and EEG experiments. Additionally, these experiments further explore the role of representational complexity and how it interacts with internal coherence. Two self-paced reading experiments revealed that having a coherent target NP facilitates encoding, early maintenance and to a lesser extent, retrieval. They also provided evidence for less effort during early maintenance of complex target NPs. Accordingly, in the EEG experiment, the conditions with simple or incoherent target NPs triggered a SAN during early maintenance relative to the conditions with complex or coherent target NPs. All these experiments together suggest that having coherent features eases both encoding and early maintenance processes.Overall, the findings demonstrate that increasing complexity or coherence at the representation level consistently facilitates WM maintenance. They also show that the SAN provides a viable ERP index for processing effort during maintenance though its behavior might be modulated by predictive processes.},

	abstract = {Adopting cannibalism substantially affects individual fitness, and recognizing the presence of other cannibals provides additional benefits such as the opportunity to prepare for hunting or defense. This recognition can be facilitated by perceiving conspecific chemical cues. Their role in cannibalistic interactions is less studied than in interspecific predation and it is unclear whether these cues inform individuals of danger or of food availability. Interpretation of these cues is crucial to balance the costs and benefits of anti-predator and feeding strategies, which can directly influence individual fitness. In this study we aimed to test whether damselfly larvae shift towards bolder and more exploratory (cannibalistic) behavior, or become more careful to avoid potential cannibals (as prey) in response to such cues. We conducted behavioral and respiratory experiments with Ischnura elegans larvae to investigate their response to chemical cues from older and larger conspecific larvae. We found that I. elegans larvae decrease their activity and shift their respiratory-related behavior, indicating activation of anti-predator defense mechanisms in response to conspecific chemical cues. Our findings indicate that individuals exposed to conspecific chemical cues balance catching prey with staying safe.},

Here, we expand the list of shallow-marine bivalves known to be exploited worldwide, with 720 exploited bivalve species added beyond the 81 in the United Nations FAO Production Database, and investigate their diversity, distribution and extinction vulnerability using a metric based on ecological traits and evolutionary history. The added species shift the richness hotspot of exploited species from the northeast Atlantic to the west Pacific, with 55\% of bivalve families being exploited, concentrated mostly in two major clades but all major body plans. We find that exploited species tend to be larger in size, occur in shallower waters, and have larger geographic and thermal ranges—the last two traits are known to confer extinction-resistance in marine bivalves. However, exploited bivalve species in certain regions such as the tropical east Atlantic and the temperate northeast and southeast Pacific, are among those with high intrinsic vulnerability and are a large fraction of regional faunal diversity. Our results pinpoint regional faunas and specific taxa of likely concern for management and conservation.Marine bivalves are important components of ecosystems and are exploited for food across the world. This study expands the list of marine bivalves known to be exploited worldwide and then uses a trait-based approach to identify intrinsically vulnerable species and to pinpoint regions with high levels of extinction-prone exploited species, helping to prioritize areas for conservation effort.},

Therefore, in this preliminary study, the accumulation of microplastics, plasticizers, and additives in the freshwater bivalves Anodonta cygnea was investigated through active biomonitoring. Specimens bought commercially were exposed in three rivers in Central Italy for different exposure times: short (1 month) and long (3 months). The gills and the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) were analyzed separately to evaluate the possible uptake and ingestion of particles via Micro-FTIR. For the first time, small microplastics (SMPs, 5–100 µm), plasticizers, additives, and other micro-litter components, e.g., natural and non-plastic synthetic fibers (APFs), were identified in the bivalve A. cygnea. The most abundant polymer in the gills (94.4\%) and in the GITs (66.1\%) was polyamide, which had the highest concentration in each river. A decrease in SMPs’ abundance was observed over time in the gills in each river, while the abundance in the GIT increased. Compared to polymers, a greater variety of APFs was observed in rivers. The APFs changed during the time of exposure and between different rivers more evidently than polymers, allowing for a clearer identification of the possible sources. These results highlighted the plastic pollution caused by SMPs using freshwater bivalves as sentinel organisms and the need to further investigate the additives that can be proxies of the presence of microplastics in the environment and biota.},

This study used different field measurements and laboratory tests of lake water to determine the impact of water hyacinth phytoremediation capacity. A total of eight sampling stations were used for the two lakes: Lake Koka and Lake Ziway, Ethiopia. Sampling stations were selected from sites infested with water hyacinth (low, medium, and high) and non-water hyacinth aquatic plants during wet or rainy and dry or non-rainy seasons to compare the effects of plants on water quality in the two lakes. All the sampled stations had various human interventions. The water samples were tested for the selected physico-chemical properties, namely, phosphate, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), the five-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), water temperature, and heavy metals (Chromium (Cr), Lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), Zinc (Zn), and Copper (Cu)). These water quality variables were compared by means of ANOVA. Despite the chemical oxygen demand (COD) of Lake Ziway, this study found no significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05) variation in the concentrations of Cu, EC, pH and water temperature between wet and dry seasons in either lake. Variations in Zn concentration and other physico-chemical parameters (EC, BOD5, COD, nitrate, phosphate) between low, medium, and high levels of water hyacinth were significant in both lakes (p {\textless} 0.05). Water hyacinth has shown significant phytoremediation nature during wet and dry seasons. The lowest average heavy metal, phosphate, and nitrate concentrations; and significant pH and temperature variations were observed in Lakes Koka and Lake Ziway, among water hyacinth and other grass-infested sites. These findings suggest water hyacinth plant as a promising nature-based solution for removing undesirable chemicals from contaminated water bodies.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryConsumers have expressed concern regarding the food safety of aquatic products in light of escalating global environmental pollution. The potential accumulation of heavy metals in red swamp crayfish, an omnivorous aquatic species, may present a significant risk to human health. Hence, a comprehensive multi-point sampling was carried out in Qianjiang, the foremost export city in China, followed by a meticulous risk evaluation of the red swamp crayfish originating from Qianjiang. In the study, we found eight significant interaction relationships that may be utilized to construct predictive models for the spatial distribution of heavy metals in crayfish tissue. The findings indicate that the abdomen muscle of crayfish does not present any discernible risk to human well-being. However, a minute fraction of crayfish hepatopancreas samples exhibited excessive levels of arsenic, rendering it inadvisable for excessive consumption.AbstractDue to rapidly expanding crayfish consumption worldwide, the food safety of red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) is of great concern. China is the largest consumer and producer of crayfish globally. As of yet, it is unknown whether the main crayfish production cities in China are within safe levels of toxic heavy metals and metalloids. For 16 consecutive years, Qianjiang city ranked first in China in processing export volumes of red swamp crayfish. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the enrichment levels and associated health risks of the species in Qianjiang. In our research, samples of four crayfish tissues, including the head, hepatopancreas, gills, and muscles, were collected from 38 sampling sites distributed in Qianjiang to evaluate the concentration levels of five heavy metals (Pb, Hg, Cd, As, and Cu). The concentration levels of all five metals in muscle did not surpass the national standard. Furthermore, eight significant correlations have been found. For further in-depth assess risk of crayfish in Qianjiang, estimated daily intake (EDI), target hazard quotient (THQ), carcinogenic risk (CR), and estimated maximum allowable consumption rates (CRmm) were evaluated in the abdomen muscle and hepatopancreas. The THQ values for each metal were found to be less than 1, while the CR values were below 10–6. Additionally, the CRmm for adults was determined to be 17.2 meals per month. These findings, based on the analysis of five metallic elements included in this study, suggest that the consumption of crayfish abdomen muscle in Qianjiang does not pose any significant health risks. However, it is noteworthy that certain regions exhibit elevated levels of arsenic in the hepatopancreas, surpassing the national standard, thereby rendering them unsuitable for excessive consumption. In general, the findings can be used to provide guidance for safe dietary practices in China.},

Due to their potentially harmful effects on ecosystems and organisms, MPs are regarded as emerging pollutants. The highly problematic aspect of MPs is their interaction with organic and inorganic pollutants; MPs can act as vectors for their further transport in the environment. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of ageing on the changes in physicochemical properties and size distribution of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), as well as to investigate the adsorption capacity of pristine and aged PET MPs, using pharmaceutical diclofenac (DCF) as a model organic pollutant. An ecotoxicity assessment of such samples was performed. Characterization of the PET samples (bottles and films) was carried out to detect the thermooxidative aging effects. The influence of the temperature and MP dosage on the extent of adsorption of DCF was elucidated by employing an empirical modeling approach using the response surface methodology (RSM). Aquatic toxicity was investigated by examining the green microalgae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata. It was found that the thermooxidative ageing process resulted in mild surface changes in PET MPs, which were reflected in changes in hydrophobicity, the amount of amorphous phase, and the particle size distribution. The fractions of the particle size distribution in the range 100–500 μm for aged PET are higher due to the increase in amorphous phase. The proposed mechanisms of interactions between DCF and PET MPs are hydrophobic and π–π interactions as well as hydrogen bonding. RSM revealed that the adsorption favors low temperatures and low dosages of MP. The combination of MPs and DCF exhibited higher toxicity than the individual components.},

	abstract = {Cathodic protection is widely used to protect metal structures from corrosion in marine environments using sacrificial galvanic anodes. These anodes, either in Zinc, or preferentially nowadays in Al-Zn-In alloys, are expected to corrode instead of the metal structures. This leads to the release of dissolved species, Zn2+, Al3+, and In3+, and solid phases such as Al(OH)3. Few studies have been conducted on their effects on marine organisms, and they concluded that further investigations are needed. We therefore evaluated the effects of Zn and Al-Zn-In anodes on oysters stabulated in tanks, under controlled conditions defined through a comparison with those prevailing in a given commercial seaport used as reference. We analyzed the entire metabolome of gills with a non-targeted metabolomic approach HRMS. A modelling study of the chemical species, corresponding to the degradation products of the anodes, likely to be present near the exposed oysters, was also included. We identified 16 and two metabolites modulated by Zn- and Al-Zn-In-anodes, respectively, that were involved in energy metabolism, osmoregulation, oxidative stress, lipid, nucleotide nucleoside and amino acid metabolisms, defense and signaling pathways. The combination of chemical modelling and metabolomic approach, used here for the first time, enlightened the influence of Zn present in the Al-Zn-In anodes.},

	abstract = {Copper (Cu) contamination has become a severe problem in freshwater environments worldwide. The freshwater mussel Anodonta woodiana is used as a unique bioindicator to monitor Cu contamination in freshwater environments. However, Cu toxicity and response mechanisms in A. woodiana are still largely unknown. A sublethal acute exposure experiment (2.0 mg/L Cu exposure for 72 h) was conducted to investigate the effects of Cu bioaccumulation on ionoregulatory homeostasis, histological features, and transcriptome responses using A. woodiana gills as indicator tissue. The gill bioaccumulation capacity was up to 474. Cu bioaccumulation decreased Na+ and Mg2+ concentrations (p {\textless} 0.05) by 82\% and 17\%, respectively, and induced cilia loss, epithelial desquamation, and filament atrophy of the gills. Transcriptome analysis identified 3160 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 1870 upregulated and 1290 downregulated genes. GO enrichment analysis showed that cellular processes, metabolic processes, biological regulation, and responses to stimuli contained the most DEGs in the biological processes. KEGG pathway analysis showed that apoptosis, arginine and proline metabolism, the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, apoptosis-multiple species, histidine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction, and the p53 signaling pathway were significantly enriched. These findings provide comprehensive evidence for exploring Cu toxicity and response mechanisms in freshwater mussels.},

The severity of this adverse scenario presents unprecedented challenges to human health, water supply, agriculture, forestry, ecological systems, and biodiversity, among other areas. Despite the progress made in various biomonitoring techniques tailored to specific countries and biotic communities, significant constraints exist, particularly in assessing and quantifying biodiversity and its interplay with detrimental factors. Incorporating modern techniques into biomonitoring methodologies presents a challenging topic with multiple perspectives and assertions. This review aims to present a comprehensive overview of the contemporary advancements in freshwater biomonitoring, specifically by utilizing omics methodologies such as genomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and multi-omics. The present study aims to elucidate the rationale behind the imperative need for modernization in this field. This will be achieved by presenting case studies, examining the diverse range of organisms that have been studied, and evaluating the potential benefits and drawbacks associated with the utilization of these methodologies. The utilization of advanced high-throughput bioinformatics techniques represents a sophisticated approach that necessitates a significant departure from the conventional practices of contemporary freshwater biomonitoring. The significant contributions of omics techniques in the context of biological quality elements (BQEs) and their interpretations in ecological problems are crucial for biomonitoring programs. Such contributions are primarily attributed to the previously overlooked identification of interactions between different levels of biological organization and their responses, isolated and combined, to specific critical conditions.},

CyanoHABs were detected from August through mid-October in both lakes. Blooms were temporally and spatially isolated, i.e., rarely concurrently detected at 3 (4.2\%) or more of the 12 sites, and blooms (75.6\%) were more frequently detected at only 1 of the 12 sites in the 10 min interval photologs. Both lakes lacked consistent meteorological and water quality precursor conditions. CyanoHABs were detected during the expected calm ({\textless}1 kph), sunny (600–900 W/m2), and warm water ({\textgreater}23 °C) episodes. However, more CyanoHABs were detected during overcast/shady ({\textless}250 W/m2) and windier (1 to 20 kph) and/or in cooler water (16 to 21 °C). More importantly, the majority of the sunny, calm, and/or warm water episodes did not experience a bloom. This suggests that nutrient availability was essential to trigger blooms in these two lakes, and we speculate that the nutrients originate from the decomposition of nearshore organic matter and runoff from the largest precipitation events.},

	abstract = {The current study aimed to determine the acute and sub-chronic toxicity of ammonia to juvenile surf clams (Mactra chinensis Philippi). Acute toxicity tests were conducted with seven concentrations of ammonium chloride using a 96 h static-renewal approach. Sub-chronic ammonia exposure tests (20 d exposures) were conducted with 6 concentrations at 20 °C. The 96 h median lethal concentration (96 h LC50) was 11.1 (10.0; 12.0) mg/L total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and 0.56 (0.50; 0.60) mg/L unionized ammonia (NH3). The relative growth rate was significantly reduced at concentrations higher than 1.6 mg/L TAN (0.075 mg/L NH3) in the 20 d tests. The estimated maximum acceptable toxicant concentration (MATC) based on the reduced growth of juvenile M. chinensis was between 0.8 and1.6 mg/L TAN (0.038–0.075 mg/L NH3). Histopathological changes were evaluated in the surviving clams after 20 days of exposure. Exposure to 14.1 mg/L TAN (0.661 mg/L NH3) resulted in changes in the mantle, foot and digestive diverticulum. We also examined the antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in 10 d and 20 d at 6 different levels (plus a control) of ammonia from 0.8 mg/L to 14.1 mg/L TAN. Ammonia exposure at 0.8 mg/L TAN (0.038 mg/L NH3) significantly affected SOD and CAT activities. The level of enzymic activity decreased with the increasing concentration of TAN. The results improved our understanding of oxidative damage under ammonia exposure and provided data for the aquaculture of sunray surf clams.},

	abstract = {One of the most deadly neglected tropical diseases known to man is schistosomiasis. Understanding how the disease spreads and evaluating the relevant control strategies are key steps in predicting its spread. We propose a mathematical model to evaluate the potential impact of four strategies: chemotherapy, awareness programs, the mechanical removal of snails and molluscicides, and the impact of a change in temperature on different molluscicide performances based on their half-lives and the length of time they persist in contact with target species. The results show that the recruitment rate of humans and the presence of cercaria and miracidia parasites are crucial factors in disease transmission. However, schistosomiasis can be entirely eradicated by combining all of the four strategies. In the face of climate change and molluscicide degradation, the results show that increasing the temperatures and the number of days a molluscicide persists in the environment before it completely degrades decreases the chemically induced mortality rate of snails while increasing the half-life of different molluscicides increases the death rate of snails. Therefore, eradicating schistosomiasis effectively necessitates a comprehensive integration of all preventative measures. Moreover, regions with different weather patterns and seasonal climates need strategies that have been adapted in terms of the appropriate molluscicide and time intervals for reapplication and effective schistosomiasis control.},

	doi = {10.3390/biology12060811},
	abstract = {Simple SummaryThe potential risks posed by microplastics is fully recognised by the scientific community. Because of the multiple pathways that allow microplastics to reach aquatic ecosystems, researchers have focused their work on the ingestion and impact of microplastics on aquatic organisms. However, the main mechanisms through which microplastics shape ecological responses at different levels in the ecological hierarchy remain understudied, and a high degree of data fragmentation exists in the literature. Functional traits, having indirect effects on the three components of individual fitness: growth, reproduction, and survival, represent the main door through which anthropogenic disturbance can enter, impacting the ecological hierarchy, community structure and composition, and ecosystems’ features. In light of this, this meta-analysis aims at using data available in the literature to understand and assess how the impacts from microplastics spread across the ecological hierarchy, from the individual to the ecosystem level, and how and if microplastics pollution is negatively affecting biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and the provision of ecosystem goods and services. Developing trait-based indicators represents a useful step to investigate the impacts of microplastics on ecosystems, and at the same time, could be used to guide policy makers in the development of adequate management plans capable of safeguarding ecosystems, together with the valuable goods and services they offer.AbstractMicroplastics represent an ever-increasing threat to aquatic organisms. We merged data from two global scale meta-analyses investigating the effect of microplastics on benthic organisms’ and fishes’ functional traits. Results were compared, allowing differences related to vertebrate and invertebrate habitat, life stage, trophic level, and experimental design to be explored. Functional traits of aquatic organisms were negatively affected. Metabolism, growth, and reproduction of benthic organisms were impacted, and fish behaviour was significantly affected. Responses differed by trophic level, suggesting negative effects on trophic interactions and energy transfer through the trophic web. The experimental design was found to have the most significant impact on results. As microplastics impact an organism’s performance, this causes indirect repercussions further up the ecological hierarchy on the ecosystem’s stability and functioning, and its associated goods and services are at risk. Standardized methods to generate salient targets and indicators are urgently needed to better inform policy makers and guide mitigation plans.},

	abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems are under pressure due to human activity. In the summer of 2022, the Odra River (Central Europe) suffered a massive death of fish and mollusks. This paper aims to show selected water quality parameters before and during the ecological disaster and find which parameters may have been crucial to the development of this disaster. We used the Kruskal–Wallis test and Spearman’s correlation to check the water parameters’ spatial and temporal diversification. In addition, non-metric multidimensional scaling was performed. The water quality parameters of the Odra system were analyzed in sections: middle Odra, lower Odra, transitional waters, and Szczecin Lagoon. Human activity has led to the formation of a system with unusual characteristics, disturbing the river’s natural continuum and related processes. The year 2022 in the middle Odra differed from the previous years in having a high water temperature ({\textgreater}24 °C), high ammonium concentrations ({\textgreater}4 mg/L), and relatively low nitrate concentrations ({\textless}6.5 mg/L). At the same time, salt pollution in the river was very high (maximum 1.4 g/L). In June and July 2022, we observed low chlorophyll a concentrations in the middle Odra (on average 2.3 µg/L and 4.4 µg/L, respectively), presumably due to salinity stress and high temperatures, suppressing freshwater phytoplankton taxa. This circumstance has created the appropriate conditions for developing euryhaline and thermophilic Prymnesium parvum. Because of decaying organisms, hypoxia occurred in the lower Odra (0.26 mg/L of dissolved oxygen in surface waters), and oxygen conditions worsened in the transitional waters ({\textless}4 mg/L). The zonal deaths of fish and mollusks result from multiple stressors induced by human activity. This disaster has proven that it is necessary to improve selected water quality parameters to reduce the risk of such disasters. The most urgent recommendations are to reduce the salt pollution of the upper section of the Odra, reduce nutrient inputs, and improve the condition of smaller rivers feeding the main course of the Odra.},

	abstract = {To date, a rather large set of both mathematical theories for species delimitation, based on single-locus genetic data, and their implementations as software products, has been accumulated. Comparison of the efficiencies of different delineation methods in the task of accumulating and analyzing data with reference to different taxa in different regions, is vital. The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency of fifteen single-locus species delimitation methods using the example of a fish species found in a single lake in European Russia (Lake Plescheyevo) with reference to other sequences of revealed taxa deposited in international databases. We analyzed 186 original COI sequences belonging to 24 haplotypes, and 101 other sequences previously deposited in GenBank and BOLD. Comparison of all 15 alternative taxonomies demonstrated that all methods adequately separate only the genera, while the number of delimited mOTUs differed from 16 (locMin) to 43 (HwM/CoMa). We can assume that the effectiveness of each method is correlated with the number of matches based on Ctax and MatchRatio criteria. The most comparable results were provided by bGMYC, mPTP, STACEY, KoT and ASAP and the most synchronous results were obtained from bGMYC, mPTP, STACEY and ASAP. We believe that these results are maximally realistic in the number of revealed mOTUs. A high genetic diversity, resulting in the existence of several mOTUs and phylogenetic lineages within many species, demonstrates the usefulness of the “polymorphic species” concept, which does not underestimate species richness and does not prevent the rational use and protection of biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The role of microplastics (MPs) in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is increasingly attracting global research attention due to their unique ecological and environmental effects. The ubiquitous use of plastics and their release into the environment by anthropic/industrial activities are the main sources for MP contamination, especially of water bodies. Because of their physical and chemical characteristics, MPs represent an ideal substrate for microbial colonization and formation of biofilm, where horizontal gene transfer is facilitated. In addition, the widespread and often injudicious use of antibiotics in various human activities leads to their release into the environment, mainly through wastewater. For these reasons, wastewater treatment plants, in particular hospital plants, are considered hotspots for the selection of ARGs and their diffusion in the environment. As a result, the interaction of MPs with drug-resistant bacteria and ARGs make them vectors for the transport and spread of ARGs and harmful microorganisms. Microplastic-associated antimicrobial resistance is an emerging threat to the environment and consequently for human health. More studies are required to better understand the interaction of these pollutants with the environment as well as to identify effective management systems to reduce the related risk.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryAmmonia (NH3/NH4+) is one of the most common contaminants in the aquaculture environment. Ammonium transporter 1 (AMT1) is a member of the Amt/Mep/Rh family that facilitates movement of ammonia across plasma membranes. However, the role of AMT1 in mollusks remains unclear. In this work, we found that the activation of AMT1 expression in razor clam (Sinonovacula constricta) can be significantly induced under high ammonia exposure, and AMT1 synergizes with Rhesus glycoprotein (Rh) to facilitate ammonia transport. The results will help to better understand the biological functions of AMT1 in razor clam ammonia excretion and improve studies of its molecular mechanism.AbstractAmmonium transporter 1 (AMT1), a member of ammonia (NH3/NH4+) transport proteins, has been found to have ammonia transport activity in plants and microorganisms. However, the functional characteristics and molecular mechanisms of AMT1 in mollusks remain unclear. The razor clam (Sinonovacula constricta) is a suitable model species to explore the molecular mechanism of ammonia excretion because of the high concentration of ambient ammonia it is exposed to in the clam–fish–shrimp polyculture system. Here, the expression of AMT1 in S. constricta (Sc-AMT1) in response to high ammonia (12.85 mmol/L NH4Cl) stress was identified by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, RNA interference, and immunofluorescence analysis. Additionally, the association between the SNP\_g.15211125A {\textgreater} T linked with Sc-AMT1 and ammonia tolerance was validated by kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP). A significant upregulated expression of Sc-AMT1 was observed during ammonia exposure, and Sc-AMT1 was found to be localized in the flat cells of gill. Moreover, the interference with Sc-AMT1 significantly upregulated the hemolymph ammonia levels, accompanied by the increased mRNA expression of Rhesus glycoprotein (Rh). Taken together, our findings imply that AMT1 may be a primary contributor to ammonia excretion in S. constricta, which is the basis of their ability to inhabit benthic water with high ammonia levels.},

	abstract = {The Gumelnița site belongs to the Kodjadermen-Gumelnița-Karanovo VI (KGK VI) communities (c. 4700–3900 cal BC) and comprises the tell-type settlement and its corresponding cemetery. This paper reconstructs the diet and lifeways of the Chalcolithic people in the northeastern Balkans using archaeological remains found at the Gumelnița site (Romania). A multi-bioarchaeological investigation (archaeobotany, zooarchaeology, anthropology) was conducted on vegetal, animal, and human remains, alongside radiocarbon dating and stable isotope analyses (δ13C, δ15N) of humans (n = 33), mammals (n = 38), reptiles (n = 3), fishes (n = 8), freshwater mussels shells (n = 18), and plants (n = 24). According to the results of δ13C and δ15N values and FRUITS, the inhabitants of Gumelnița had a diet based on crops and using natural resources, such as fish, freshwater molluscs and game. Although domestic fauna was occasionally exploited for meat, it had a role in providing secondary products. Crops were heavily manured, and chaff and other crop waste may have been necessary fodder for cattle and sheep. Dogs and pigs fed on human waste, although the diet of the latter is more similar to that of wild boars. Foxes had a diet close to dogs, which may indicate synanthropic behaviour. Radiocarbon dates were calibrated with the percentage of freshwater resources obtained by FRUITS. As a result, the corrected dates for the freshwater reservoir effect (FRE) have a delay of an average of 147 years. According to our data, this agrarian community developed a subsistence strategy under the pressure of some climatic changes that started after 4300 cal BC, corresponding to KGK VI rapid collapse/decline episode tracked recently (that begins around 4350 cal BC). This matching of our data in the two models (climatic and chrono-demographic) allowed us to capture the economic strategies that led to the resilience of those people more than other contemporary KGK VI communities.},

We evaluated the following parameters: E. coli cell viability, toxicity and protein damage, sodA promoter induction and ROS generation. It was found that FLU, Nor-FLU, NA, CA and their mixtures are toxic and they have the potency to generate oxidative stress in E. coli strains. We also detected that the wastewater, in comparison to the microbial medium, had an influence on the toxic activity and oxidative stress synthesis of the tested chemicals and their mixtures. Regardless of the environment under study, the strongest toxic activity and oxidative stress generation were detected after bacterial incubation with NA at a concentration of 1 mg/dm3 and the mixture of FLU (1 mg/dm3) with Nor-FLU (0.1 mg/dm3) and with NA (0.1 mg/dm3). The ROS synthesis and sodA promoter induction suggest that, in the case of the examined compounds and their mixtures, oxidative stress is the mechanism of toxicity. The analysis of the types of interactions among the substances constituting the mixtures in the wastewater revealed synergism, potentiation and antagonism.},

	abstract = {Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) contamination in the Toce River in northern Italy was studied by collecting data from 2016 to 2021 upstream and downstream of a production factory which in the past had discharged technical DDT. Analysis of sediments and of bioaccumulation in different benthic invertebrate taxa (Gammaridae, Diptera, Ephemeroptera Baetidae and Heptageniidae) was carried out to assess the transfer of DDT from sediments to benthic invertebrates and the environmental risk of this legacy pollutant for the river ecosystem. DDT and its metabolites dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD), here called DDx, were analyzed by isotope dilution gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). DDx values in sediments in upstream stations (1.14–2.25 ng g−1 1\% Organic Carbon) were lower than downstream of the industrial site (5.60–7.60 ng g−1 1\% Organic Carbon), often exceeding Sediment Quality Guidelines for total DDx. Peak levels derived from new inputs of parental DDT, as confirmed by fingerprint analysis. Bioaccumulation was higher at downstream sites (up to 5107 ng g−1 lipid weight), confirming the bioavailability of residual DDT as well as active metabolism, with the formation of DDD and DDE. The Biota-Sediment Accumulation Factor evidenced the highest values (over 4.2) for Diptera and Gammaridae, highlighting that invertebrates can transfer contamination from sediments to the trophic chain. Linear regression models were developed to estimate DDx concentrations in benthic invertebrates from DDx concentrations in sediments. However, determination coefficients R2 remained in the range of 0.36–0.51, highlighting the necessity of bioaccumulation analysis to fully estimate environmental risk. The results show that DDT contamination, even if residual, may still represent a risk due to its effective transfer to the trophic chain.},

The current analysis discovered four significant evidence-based points. First, the field-collected populations showed that the BYS was a more sensitive, concentrative, and accumulative biopolymer for the three metals than for total soft tissues (TST). Second, the results of the interspecific comparison showed that the mussels’ BYS was a significantly better biomonitoring biopolymer for identifying coastal areas exposed to Zn, Cd, and Cu pollution and demonstrated the role of the BYS as a route for the excretion of metal wastes. Third, the BYS was more reflective of metal bioavailability and pollution in coastal waters. Fourth, and most crucially, the field-based cage transplantation investigation amply demonstrated the accumulation and removal of the three metals by the BYS in the Straits of Johore in both contaminated and unpolluted areas. In conclusion, the mussel BYS was verified to be a superior biopolymer to TST for determining Zn (as well as Cd and Cu) bioavailability and contamination in tropical coastal waters.AbstractThe present study aimed to confirm the use of the byssus (BYS) of the green-lipped mussel Perna viridis as a biomonitoring biopolymer for zinc (Zn) by comparing it to copper (Cu) and cadmium (Cd) pollution in coastal waters under experimental field conditions, based on the transplantation of caged mussels between polluted and unpolluted sites in the Straits of Johore (SOJ). Four important evidential points were found in the present study. First, the 34 field-collected populations with BYS/total soft tissue (TST) ratios {\textgreater} 1 indicated that the BYS was a more sensitive, concentrative, and accumulative biopolymer for the three metals than TST. Significant (p {\textless} 0.05) and positive correlations between BYS and TST in terms of the levels of the three metals were observed. Second, the data obtained in the present study were well-supported by the interspecific comparison, which indicated that the BYS of P. viridis was a significantly better biomonitoring biopolymer for the identification of coastal areas exposed to Zn, Cd, and Cu pollution and played the role of an excretion route of metal wastes. Third, the higher positive correlation coefficients for the metals between the BYS sedimentary geochemical fractions than the TST sedimentary geochemical fractions indicated that the BYS was more reflective of metal bioavailability and contamination in coastal waters. Fourth, and most importantly, the field-based cage transplantation study clearly indicated the accumulation and elimination of the three metals by the BYS in both polluted and unpolluted sites in the Straits of Johore. In sum, the BYS of P. viridis was confirmed as a better biopolymer than TST for Zn, as well as Cd and Cu, bioavailability and contamination in tropical coastal waters.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryThe effects of the presence of predators (fish and shrimp) on the assemblage composition and diversity of phytoplankton were accurately characterized using outdoor mesocosms containing natural phytoplankton and zooplankton communities coupled with high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that the alpha diversity of phytoplankton and the relative abundance of Chlorophyceae increased with the addition of the fish Pelteobagrus fulvidraco, while the former decreased and the latter increased with the addition of the shrimp Exopalaemon modestus. The alpha diversity of phytoplankton and the relative abundance of Chlorophycea increased with the addition of fish and shrimp together, but these changes were less than the sum of the individual impacts of these two predators.AbstractIntraguild predation (IGP) can have a significant impact on phytoplankton biomass, but its effects on their diversity and assemblage composition are not well understood. In this study, we constructed an IGP model based on the common three-trophic food chain of “fish (or shrimp)–large branchiopods (Daphnia)–phytoplankton”, and investigated the effects of IGP on phytoplankton assemblage composition and diversity in outdoor mesocosms using environmental DNA high-throughput sequencing. Our results indicated that the alpha diversities (number of amplicon sequence variants and Faith’s phylogenetic diversity) of phytoplankton and the relative abundance of Chlorophyceae increased with the addition of Pelteobagrus fulvidraco, while similar trends were found in alpha diversities but with a decrease in the relative abundance of Chlorophyceae in the Exopalaemon modestus treatment. When both predators were added to the community, the strength of collective cascading effects on phytoplankton alpha diversities and assemblage composition were weaker than the sum of the individual predator effects. Network analysis further showed that this IGP effect also decreased the strength of collective cascading effects in reducing the complexity and stability of the phytoplankton assemblages. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the impacts of IGP on lake biodiversity, and provide further knowledge relevant to lake management and conservation.},

The clam Cyclina sinensis is an economically important marine bivalve that has three main colors: black, white, and purple. In the present study, we cloned and analyzed the full-length cDNA of the tyrosinase gene (TYR), which is the key gene for melanin synthesis, to explore the formation mechanism of black shells. The full-length cDNA of TYR was cloned by RACE-PCR, and the results showed that the full-length cDNA of TYR was 2993 bp, including a 2262 bp open reading frame encoding 753 amino acids. The results of functional domain prediction showed that deduced TYR protein contains a typical functional domain of tyrosinase, the common central domain. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood methods, and the results indicated that the evolutionary positions of C. sinensis and Meretrix meretrix were closest. The qRT‒PCR results showed that TYR mRNA was highly expressed in the outer edge of the mantle, which suggested that TYR was involved in the synthesis of melanin in the mantle of C. sinensis and might play an important regulatory role in the formation of melanin in black clam shells.},

Ruditapes philippinarum is a filter-feeding shellfish with both ecological and economic significance, and it is classified as a Mollusca (phylum), Bivalvia (class), Veneridae (family), and Ruditapes (genus). In this study, 16S high-throughput sequencing was used to explore the microbiomics of digestive glands and gills of R. philippinarum under temporary rearing without feeding (including the purification process) in different water environments (natural vs. artificial seawater) from 0–7 days. The results revealed that the digestive glands and gills of R. philippinarum had their own unique bacterial community structures. Tissue microorganisms under the overlap of different water environments and starvation factors showed different dynamic effects within 0–7 days. The sand spitting and purification steps (posttransport rehydration stage of 24 hours) effectively reduced microorganism abundance. There were different biomarkers in the prerearing and postrearing periods, and R. philippinarum may be more susceptible to the enrichment of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria during the postrearing period in artificial seawater.},

	abstract = {Underwater light reduction is presumably becoming more frequent and intensified due to eutrophication and algal blooms, which may significantly affect submerged macrophytes’ growth. However, a comprehensive understanding of how light reduction influences growth-related traits and responses is currently lacking. Here, we compiled data from 333 records of 62 published works that used controlled experiments to explore the responses of functional traits associated with growth to light reduction. Our results indicated that light reduction significantly decreased the relative growth rate (RGR), ramet number (RM), shoot biomass (SB), root biomass (RB), soluble carbohydrates (SC), and leaf number (LN) by 38.2\%, 60.0\%, 59.2\%, 55.4\%, 30.0\%, and 56.1\%, respectively, but elevated the chlorophyll content (Chl) by 25.8\%. Meanwhile, the responses of RGR to light reduction increased significantly with the responses of RM, SB, RB, and root-to-shoot ratio (R/S). Considering the relationships among the growth-related traits, we further found that the responses of RGR to light reduction were mainly driven by the RM rather than leaf photosynthetic capability, indicating the importance of tiller ability under low light stress. We also identified a tipping point of the response of RGR to light reduction, which might be incorporated into hydrophyte dynamic models to improve precision. Our results highlight the importance of growth-related traits, andthese traits may need to be incorporated into models to improve the prediction of distribution and area for submerged species or to provide guidance for the restoration and sustainable development of aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {In sexual organisms, speciation occurs as genetically based barriers evolve between populations to cause them to become reproductively isolated. The types and chronology in which different reproductive isolating (RI) barriers arise may vary depending on the ecological and geographic context of divergence and may not necessarily remain constant throughout the divergence process. Thus, mixed modes of speciation may be common. Research has mainly focused on divergent ecological adaptation, sexual selection, and intrinsic nuclear genomic incompatibilities as the sources of RI brought about by ecological and geographic speciation, but recent work demonstrates that endosymbionts may also contribute RI. For example, one of the most common endosymbionts, Wolbachia, can induce cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) that causes postmating reproductive isolation between populations infected with incompatible strains. Like other forms of RI barriers, Wolbachia induced RI is not constant through time as Wolbachia are continuously purged from and horizontally transferred into host lineages. Studies are needed that synthesize across both endosymbiont and non-endosymbiont related RI to understand how episodic RI provided by Wolbachia can contribute to host-related RI and influence the diversification process of its host. To address this gap, the goal of my dissertation is to study how Wolbachia induced CI and other mixed modes of speciation influence host RI dynamics during speciation. To accomplish this objective, my research leveraged the biology and natural history of the Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) cingulata sibling species group endemic to N. America. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 characterize forms of premating and postmating isolation between cherry flies, between olive flies, and between both clades respectively. Chapter 5 uses comparative genomics to study a case of putative Wolbachia strain introgression, and Chapter 6 uses comparative genomics to study the variation of the universal Wolbachia strain, wCin2, from cherry flies across N. America. In Chapter 2, I found a unique Wolbachia strain, wCin3, that putatively causes CI in crosses to other cherry fly populations, and, when coupled with other strong ecological RI, may contribute meaningful RI to the speciation process. In Chapter 3, I identified strong ecological allochronic isolation between olive flies. In Chapter 4, I observed a mixed mode of speciation between olive and cherry flies in which ecological and allopatric divergence both contribute at differing times to the evolution of pre- and postmating reproductive isolation, including the observation of increased premating isolation potentially due to reinforcement or reproductive character displacement. In Chapter 5, despite near identical sequences for the multi locus sequencing markers, substantial sequence differences for other loci were found between wCer2 and wCin2, as well as structural rearrangements, and differences in prophage, repetitive element, gene content, and CI inducing genes. Finally in Chapter 6, I report that wCin2 from the Southwest strain is highly diverged in gene content, structure, and cif genes from wCin2 genomes from other regions. In contrast, the wCin2 strains from these other regions are very near identical in sequence content and cif gene content, but possess unique structural rearrangements associated with mobile genetic elements, some of which impact cif gene function. Overall, my Dissertation provides new evidence for the importance of geographic and biological context when studying speciation and how dynamics driving the evolution of RI barriers can potentially change over the course of speciation. My research also shows Wolbachia associated RI is likely transient on an evolutionary time scale due its dynamic genome. Taken together, these findings provide insight into how mixed modes of speciation, including any associated endosymbionts, may have impacted the chronology and strength of RI barriers in the R. cingulata sibling species group.},

	abstract = {The “Chernobyl nuclear disaster” released huge amounts of radionuclides, which are still detectable in plants and sediments today. Bryophytes (mosses) are primitive land plants lacking roots and protective cuticles and therefore readily accumulate multiple contaminants, including metals and radionuclides. This study quantifies 137Cs and 241Am in moss samples from the cooling pond of the power plant, the surrounding woodland and the city of Prypiat. Activity concentrations of up to 297 Bq/g (137Cs) and 0.43 Bq/g (241Am) were found. 137Cs contents were significantly higher at the cooling pond, where 241Am was not detectable. Distance to the damaged reactor, amount of original fallout, presence of vascular tissue in the stem or taxonomy were of little importance. Mosses seem to absorb radionuclides rather indiscriminately, if available. More than 30 years after the disaster, 137Cs was washed out from the very top layer of the soil, where it is no more accessible for rootless mosses but possibly for higher plants. On the other hand, 137Cs still remains solved and accessible in the cooling pond. However, 241Am remained adsorbed to the topsoil, thus accessible to terrestrial mosses, but precipitated in the sapropel of the cooling pond.},

The results demonstrated that clams accumulate ZnS NPs and other metallic elements following exposure. Moreover, ZnS NPs and P separately lead to ROS overproduction, while a mixture of both contaminants has no effect. In addition, data showed that exposure to P100 resulted in increased levels of oxidative stress enzyme activities catalase (CAT) in the gills and digestive glands. A similar trend was also observed in the digestive glands of clams treated with ZnS100. In contrast, CAT activity was decreased in the gills at the same concentration. Exposure to ZnS100 and P100 separately leads to a decrease in acetylcholinesterase (AChE) levels in both gills and digestive glands. Thus, AChE and CAT after co-exposure to an environmental mixture of nanoparticles (ZnS100) and phosphonate (P100) did not show any differences between treated and non-treated clams. The outcome of this work certifies the use of biomarkers and chemical assay when estimating the effects of phosphonate and nanoparticles as part of an ecotoxicological assessment program. An exceptional focus was given to the interaction between ZnS NPs and P. The antioxidant activity of P has been demonstrated to have an additive effect on metal accumulation and antagonistic agents against oxidative stress in clams treated with ZnS NPs.},

In this context, biological adhesives secreted by marine invertebrates have appealing characteristics to incorporate into new underwater biomimetic adhesives: water resistance, nontoxicity and biodegradability. Little is still known about temporary adhesion. Recently, a transcriptomic differential analysis of sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus tube feet pinpointed 16 adhesive/cohesive protein candidates. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the adhesive secreted by this species is composed of high molecular weight proteins associated with N-Acetylglucosamine in a specific chitobiose arrangement. As a follow-up, we aimed to investigate which of these adhesive/cohesive protein candidates were glycosylated through lectin pulldowns, protein identification by mass spectroscopy and in silico characterization. We demonstrate that at least five of the previously identified protein adhesive/cohesive candidates are glycoproteins. We also report the involvement of a third Nectin variant, the first adhesion-related protein to be identified in P. lividus. By providing a deeper characterization of these adhesive/cohesive glycoproteins, this work advances our understanding of the key features that should be replicated in future sea urchin-inspired bioadhesives.},

The aim of this work was to determine the cause of a disease outbreak in eight captive nursehounds that died after 18 months of captivity. Gross necropsy observations were indicative of a presumptive diagnosis of hemorrhagic septicemia. Histological and molecular techniques were performed, to diagnose the etiological agents that could be involved in their mortality.

However, since plastic debris is highly resistant to environmental degradation, a growing presence of plastics in all the ecosystems has been confirmed. Among them, plastic particles {\textless} 5 mm, also known as microplastics (MPs), are of special concern because they are dispersed in aerial, terrestrial and aquatic environments, being the soil the main environmental sink of these contaminants. Due to their large specific surface area and hydrophobicity, MPs are considered good adsorbents for other environmental organic pollutants also present in terrestrial ecosystems, such as pharmaceuticals, personal-care products or pesticides with which they can interact and thus modify their environmental fate. In this review article, we examine the recent literature (from 2017 to 2022) to get a better understanding of the environmental fate of pesticides in soil (adsorption, mobility and/or degradation) when they are simultaneously present with MPs and the ecological risks on living organisms of the interactions between MPs and pesticides in soil. More studies are needed to fully understand the toxicological impact of the copresence in soil of pesticides and MPs.},

The behavioral reactions of Unio pictorum (Linnaeus, 1758) were employed in the development of a comprehensive automated monitoring system for aquatic environments by the authors. The study used experimental data obtained by an automated system from the Chernaya River in the Sevastopol region of the Crimean Peninsula. Four traditional unsupervised machine learning techniques were implemented to detect emergency signals in the activity of bivalves: elliptic envelope, isolation forest (iForest), one-class support vector machine (SVM), and local outlier factor (LOF). The results showed that the use of the elliptic envelope, iForest, and LOF methods with proper hyperparameter tuning can detect anomalies in mollusk activity data without false alarms, with an F1 score of 1. A comparison of anomaly detection times revealed that the iForest method is the most efficient. These findings demonstrate the potential of using bivalve mollusks as bioindicators in automated monitoring systems for the early detection of pollution in aquatic environments.},

	abstract = {Environmental monitoring should be minimally disruptive to the ecosystems that it is embedded in. Therefore, the project Robocoenosis suggests using biohybrids that blend into ecosystems and use life forms as sensors. However, such a biohybrid has limitations regarding memory—as well as power—capacities, and can only sample a limited number of organisms. We model the biohybrid and study the degree of accuracy that can be achieved by using a limited sample. Importantly, we consider potential misclassification errors (false positives and false negatives) that lower accuracy. We suggest the method of using two algorithms and pooling their estimations as a possible way of increasing the accuracy of the biohybrid. We show in simulation that a biohybrid could improve the accuracy of its diagnosis by doing so. The model suggests that for the estimation of the population rate of spinning Daphnia, two suboptimal algorithms for spinning detection outperform one qualitatively better algorithm. Further, the method of combining two estimations reduces the number of false negatives reported by the biohybrid, which we consider important in the context of detecting environmental catastrophes. Our method could improve environmental modeling in and outside of projects such as Robocoenosis and may find use in other fields.},

	abstract = {The widespread occurrence of microplastics (MPs) has resulted in their interaction with biological processes. Thus, there is a great concern about the potential toxicity of MPs on animal and plant cells and on the possibility that MPs reach humans through the food web. In order to shed light on both issues, laboratory assays were performed for evaluating the effects of polyethylene (PE) microparticles on the aquatic plant Spirodela polyrhiza (L.) Schleid. and the gammarid Echinogammarus veneris (Heller, 1865). Moreover, a stock of MP-treated Spirodela plants was used to feed gammarid individuals, and the presence of MP particles in their digestive tracts was analyzed. Results evidenced the lack of toxic effects of MPs on plants, evaluated at growth and physiological level by biometric parameters, pigment content, and photosynthetic performance estimated by chlorophyll fluorescence imaging through the ETPT (EcoTox Photosystem Tool). Only a slight reduction in pigment-related indices in MP-treated plants was observed. A remarkable genotoxic effect was instead highlighted by Comet assay in the hemocytes of gammarid individuals exposed to MPs, with three times more DNA damage (expressed as Tail Moment) in MP-treated individuals compared to control ones. Finally, the gut content of the gammarids fed with MP-treated plants revealed the presence of 7.6 MP particles/individual, highlighting the occurrence of trophic transfer of MPs among freshwater ecosystem organisms. Novel indications about the potential impact of the PE microparticles in the aquatic compartment are provided. Notably, the transfer of MP particles between primary producer and primary consumer organisms of the freshwater trophic chain and the genotoxic effects associated with the ingestion of such particles by gammarids are issues of concern for the aquatic ecosystem and the food web leading to the human diet.},

Because of its high human consumption rate and low environmental degradation rate, ibuprofen represents an emerging environmental problem. Ibuprofen enters the environment from different sources and accumulates in natural environmental matrices. The problem of drugs, particularly ibuprofen, as contaminants is complicated because few strategies consider them or apply successful technologies to remove them in a controlled and efficient manner. In several countries, ibuprofen’s entry into the environment is an unattended contamination problem. It is a concern for our environmental health system that requires more attention. Due to its physicochemical characteristics, ibuprofen degradation is difficult in the environment or by microorganisms. There are experimental studies that are currently focused on the problem of drugs as potential environmental contaminants. However, these studies are insufficient to address this ecological issue worldwide. This review focuses on deepening and updating the information concerning ibuprofen as a potential emerging environmental contaminant and the potential for using bacteria for its biodegradation as an alternative technology.},

The main objective of this research is to develop a new approach to necessary policies and ways of action to decrease water pollution caused by microplastics. In this context, we quantified the impact of European water pollution caused by microplastics in the circular economy. The main research methods used in the paper are meta-analysis, statistical analysis and an econometric approach. A new econometric model is developed in order to assist the decision makers in increasing efficiency of public policies regarding water pollution elimination. The main result of this study relies on combining, in an integrated way, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) data on microplastic water pollution and identifying relevant policies to combat this type of pollution.},

These metabolites reveal diversified mechanisms of action, encompassing cyto-, neuro-, hepato-, nephro-, and neurotoxicity, and pose a threat to aquatic biota and human health. In the present paper, we review data on the occurrence of the most studied cyanotoxins, microcystins, nodularins, cylindrospermopsin, anatoxins, and saxitoxins, in the aquatic environment, as well as their potential bioaccumulation and toxicity in fish. Microcystins are the most studied among all known cyanotoxins, although other toxic cyanobacterial metabolites are also commonly identified in aquatic environments and can reveal high toxicity in fish. Except for primary toxicity signs, cyanotoxins adversely affect the antioxidant system and anti-/pro-oxidant balance. Cyanotoxins also negatively impact the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, fish exposed to microcystins and cylindrospermopsin exhibit various immunomodulatory, inflammatory, and endocrine responses. Even though cyanotoxins exert a complex pressure on fish, numerous aspects are yet to be the subject of in-depth investigation. Metabolites other than microcystins should be studied more thoroughly to understand the long-term effects in fish and provide a robust background for monitoring and management actions.},

Results indicated that although Cr, either alone or in combination with CNTs, was found in a similar concentration level in both species, a species-specific Cr accumulation was observed, with higher values in R. decussatus in comparison with R. philippinarum. Inhibition of antioxidant defenses and neurotoxic effects were detected only in R. philippinarum. The interaction between contaminants seems to have no effect in terms of antioxidant enzyme activities and neuro status. Nevertheless, synergistic activation of responses to both contaminants may have altered the metabolic capacity of bivalves, particularly evident in R. decussatus. While both clams are tolerant to both contaminants (alone and together), they showed a relevant accumulation capacity, which may represent a possible contaminant transfer to humans.},

	abstract = {The occurrence, bioaccumulation, and risks of 11 pairs of pharmaceutical metabolites and their respective parents were investigated in the water, sediment, and fish of an urban river in Nanjing city, China. The results showed that most of the target metabolites and their parents were detected in all water samples, with concentrations ranging from 0.1 ng/L to 72.9 ng/L. In some cases, the concentrations of metabolites in water were significantly higher than their parents, with fold changes reaching up 4.1 in the wet season and 6.6 in the dry season, while in sediment and fish, a lower concentration was observed in most cases. A lowered concentration of detected pharmaceuticals was observed in the dry season when compared to the wet season due to the seasonal variation in pharmaceutical consumption and overflow effluent. The bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals in different fish tissues were detected with a descending order of overall concentration as gill {\textgreater} brain {\textgreater} muscle {\textgreater} gonad {\textgreater} intestine {\textgreater} liver {\textgreater} blood. In addition, the concentrations of both metabolites and their parents also decreased along the river in two seasons. However, the concentration rates of metabolites and their parents were significantly altered along the river in both water and sediment. The relatively high concentration proportions of the detected pharmaceuticals in water suggested that pharmaceuticals were more likely to apportion in water than in sediment, especially for the metabolites. Meanwhile, the rates of the metabolite/parent pairs between fish and water/sediment were generally lower, indicating the higher excretion capacity of metabolites from fish than their parents. Most of the detected pharmaceuticals had no impact on aquatic organisms. However, the presence of ibuprofen posed a medium risk to fish. Compared to the parents, metabolites showed a relatively low risk value but a high contribution to the total risk. It highlights that metabolites in the aquatic environments cannot be ignored.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, most of our understanding of lake zooplankton dynamics is from data collected in the pelagic, open water zone. However, the littoral and benthic zones of lakes can play a role in zooplankton community interactions and relationships. Utricularia spp., or the bladderworts, inhabit littoral and shallow waters of lakes and consume zooplankton. Limited information exists on the dietary habits of bladderworts and how diet varies across lakes and seasonally. Bladderwort dietary assemblage in two Michigan, USA, lakes was quantified during the thermally stratified period of 2020, and was compared to zooplankton in the adjacent water column. Bladderwort trap size was positively related to zooplankton prey size, but not number of prey consumed or taxa richness. Bladderworts consumed a variety of prey, the majority dominated by littoral cladoceran and ostracod taxa. Seasonal change was observed, with significantly higher ostracod dominance earlier in the season, shifting into cladoceran dominance later in the season. Ostracods were more commonly found in traps than the water column, whereas Cladocera were more commonly found in the water column than the traps. These results shed light into the dietary habits of bladderworts, which can have consequences for food web dynamics and energy transfer in small lake systems.},

The glycogen synthase (GYS) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) are two major enzymes in the glycogenesis. However, the information of the two genes in the Jinjiang oyster Crassostrea ariakensis remains limited. In this study, we identified the genes of GYS and GSK3β and further explored their function in the glycogen synthesis of C. ariakensis. The GYS and GSK3β were distributed in all tested tissues, and high expression of GYS and glycogen content were detected in the gonad, labial palp, hepatopancreas, and mantle, while the high expression of GSK3β was observed in the gill and adductor muscle. The expression of GYS was positively correlated with the glycogen content, while GSK3β was negatively correlated. Additionally, knockdown of GSK3β using RNAi decreased the GYS expression, revealing the negative regulatory effect of GSK3β on GYS. These findings enrich the research data of GSK3β and GYS involved in glycogen synthesis, providing valuable information for further research on the function of GSK3β and GYS in the glycogen synthesis process of oyster.},

These faunal proxies are essential indicators of hydrological shifts reflecting global and regional climate changes. Adding lithological, geochemical, and geochronological (radiocarbon) data, we revealed paleogeographic events of different scales recorded in the sequence of the Rybachya core from the North Caspian Sea. Here, we present the reconstruction of Mangyshlak paleovalley sediments during the Holocene multi-stage Neocaspian transgression, reflecting global and regional climate changes varying in scale and direction. The determined age of paleovalley-fill sediments, 8070 ± 110 cal yr BP and 7020 ± 140 cal yr BP, suggests that sedimentation processes with extended warming and humidification started later and lasted longer than was assumed earlier. Biological proxies indicate quasi-cyclic variability and shifts from brackish to freshwater conditions throughout the studied interval. Rybachya core was obtained from the early Khvalynian deposits. The Mangyshlak flow formed the depression and eroded the late Khvalynian deposits, which we did not observe in the core structure. It possibly collapsed into paleodepression and acted as a host material for the freshwater lentic faunal association. During the Holocene, we detected a transition from a tranquil water regime to a more dynamic one during the paleovalley gradual filling, followed by marine conditions typical for the modern Caspian Sea.},

However, calcium, magnesium, and/or potassium are starting to be proposed as potential surrogates for NaCl, but for which ecotoxicological effects are less explored. This study aimed to identify (i) the less toxic salt to freshwater biota to be suggested as a safer alternative deicer and (ii) to contribute to the lower tiers of salinity risk assessment frameworks by identifying a more suitable surrogate salt than NaCl. The battery of ecotoxicity assays with five key trophic level species showed that among the tested salts (MgCl2, CaCl2, and KCl), KCl and CaCl2 seemed to induce the highest and lowest toxicity, respectively, compared with NaCl. CaCl2 is suggested as a safer alternative for use as a deicer and KCl as a surrogate for the risk assessment of seawater intrusion in coastal regions. These results enrich the salt toxicity database aiming to identify and propose more suitable surrogate salts to predict the effects of salinization to a broader extent.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is an important component of the human diet, providing high-quality aquatic food for global or local consumption. Egypt is one of the countries most vulnerable to the potential impacts of climate change (CC), especially in the aquaculture sector. CC is one of the biggest challenges of our time and has negatively affected different water bodies. CC leads to the combination of changes in water availability, a decrease in water quality, the movement of salt water upstream due to rising sea levels, and the salinization of groundwater supplies will threaten inland freshwater aquaculture. Similarly, higher temperatures resulting from CC lead to reduce dissolved oxygen levels, increased fish metabolic rates, increased risk of disease spread, increased fish mortality, and consequently decreased fish production. CC may also indirectly affect aquaculture activities; for example, large areas of lowland aquaculture ponds can be highly vulnerable to flooding from rising sea levels. Thus, the current overview will briefly discuss the state of the aquaculture sector in Egypt, the meaning of CC, its causes, and its effects on the different elements of the aquaculture sector, and finally, we will review the appropriate ways to mitigate the adverse effects of CC on fish farming, especially in Egypt.},

	abstract = {Microcystins and nodularins, produced naturally by certain species of cyanobacteria, have been found to accumulate in aquatic foodstuffs such as fish and shellfish, resulting in a risk to the health of the seafood consumer. Monitoring of toxins in such organisms for risk management purposes requires the availability of certified matrix reference materials to aid method development, validation and routine quality assurance. This study consequently targeted the preparation of a mussel tissue reference material incurred with a range of microcystin analogues and nodularins. Nine targeted analogues were incorporated into the material as confirmed through liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), with an additional 15 analogues detected using LC coupled to non-targeted high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Toxins in the reference material and additional source tissues were quantified using LC-MS/MS, two different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods and with an oxidative-cleavage method quantifying 3-methoxy-2-methyl-4-phenylbutyric acid (MMPB). Correlations between the concentrations quantified using the different methods were variable, likely relating to differences in assay cross-reactivities and differences in the abilities of each method to detect bound toxins. A consensus concentration of total soluble toxins determined from the four independent test methods was 2425 ± 575 µg/kg wet weight. A mean 43 ± 9\% of bound toxins were present in addition to the freely extractable soluble form (57 ± 9\%). The reference material produced was homogenous and stable when stored in the freezer for six months without any post-production stabilization applied. Consequently, a cyanotoxin shellfish reference material has been produced which demonstrates the feasibility of developing certified seafood matrix reference materials for a large range of cyanotoxins and could provide a valuable future resource for cyanotoxin risk monitoring, management and mitigation.},

The purpose of this study examined the sub-lethal toxicity of low concentrations (ug/L range) of selected nanoparticles alone and in mixtures in juvenile trout. Fish were exposed to to individual and two environmentally relevant mixtures of silver (nAg), copper oxide (nCuO) and cerium oxide (nCeO) nanoparticles for 96 h at 15 °C. After the exposure period, fish were depurated overnight and tissue levels in Ag, Ce, Cu and Zn were determined along with a suite of effects biomarkers such as oxidative stress/inflammation, denatured protein tagging (ubiquitin), DNA strand breaks (genotoxicity) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. The data showed that these nanoparticles behaved as suspended matter but were nevertheless bioavailable for fish with bioconcentration factors of 6, 8 and 2 for nAg, nCeO and nCuO respectively. Only nCuO alone increased malonaldehyde (lipid peroxidation) contents but all nanoparticles increased DNA damage, protein-ubiquitin labeling, and decreased AChE activity. Globally, the toxicity of nCeO and nCuO was generally stronger than nAg, and antagonist effects were found in the mixtures. The interactions involved in these antagonisms are not well understood but do not involve the liberation of free ions and labile zinc in tissues. In conclusion, the bioavailability and toxicity of these nanoparticles are influenced by mixtures of nanoparticles, which is likely to occur in contaminated environments.},

The first medical reports associating cancer with pollutants like tars appeared by the early 20th century, but despite initial evidence relating oncogenesis and chromosomal alterations, only after the structure of DNA had been elucidated in the 1950s have genetic disorders been fully perceived as cause. This led to a growing interest in genotoxic and mutagenic pollutants. Even though we are now familiar with a range of environmental carcinogens spanning between aromatic hydrocarbons and asbestos to radionuclides and forms of carbon nanomaterials, establishing causal networks between pollutants and cancer remains cumbersome. In most part, this is due to the complexity of toxicant matrices, unknown modes-of-action of chemicals or their mixtures, the widening array of novel pollutants plus difficulties in subtracting background effects from true aetiology of disease. Recent advances in analytical chemistry, high-throughput toxicology, next-generation sequencing, computational biology and databases that allocate whole normal and cancer genomes, all indicate that we are on the verge of a new age of research into mechanistic ‘oncotoxicology’, but how can it impact risk assessment and prevention?},

The dominant operational taxonomic unit in the pseudofeces and gut content of C. fluminea was Microcyclops varicans (Copepoda) and Oncorhynchus mykiss (Fish), respectively. The alpha diversity at site 1 was higher than that at site 2. More diverse potential prey species were identified at the site with low salinity (i.e., site 1).

This long-term field study deepens the knowledge concerning the life cycle of Chironomus plumosus (Diptera), the main responsible for summer chironomid swarms that adversely affect human littoral activities, providing useful information for its management. About 108,000 macrobenthic specimens were collected, belonging to Oligochaeta (Naididae) (62\%), Diptera (Chironomidae) (37\%), and only 1.5\% to other invertebrate taxa. Eighteen chironomid taxa were found. The trend of chironomid density was not affected by C. plumosus, which showed a maximum increase in September. This peak is justified by the presence of large swarms of C. plumosus in late August in which the populations of the central area of Lake Trasimeno consistently participate. The larval density of this species did not increase over the 17 years. A detailed analysis of the sampled larvae and adult biomass catches from 2017 to 2020 reveals that four annual swarmings occurred: in April, July, August, and September–October. The water temperature remains higher than 20 °C during the night hours from the end of May to mid-September, strengthening the hypothesis of the three midge swarming cycles in the summer period until early autumn.},

	abstract = {Organochlorine is a synthetic pesticide that has been banned in many countries because of its high persistence in the environment and can accumulate in animals. The goal of our study was to determine the level of organochlorine residues in surface water and in the mussel Corbicula sumatrana of Lake Singkarak. Water and mussel samples were collected from 10 sampling sites of Lake Singkarak, Batu Taba, Sumpur, Guguk Malalo, Ombilin, Tikalak, Sumani, Saniang Baka, Muaro Pingai, Paninggahan, and Tanjung Mutuih, respectively in June 2021. Water and mussel samples were extracted and analyzed with gas chromatography. The result of our study revealed the occurrence of Lindan (7 μg/L) in the surface water of Tikalak, and also Aldrin (3 μg/L) in the surface water of Tikalak, Sumani, and Ombilin. Organochlorine residue compounds were also detected in mussels of five sampling sites (Tikalak, Sumani, Muaro Pingai, Paninggahan, and Tanjung Mutuih). Mussels of Tikalak contain compounds namely Dieldrin, Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and Endosulfan with levels of 2 μg/kg, 6 μg/kg, and 3 μg/kg, respectively. Dieldrin was also detected at Sumani (2 μg/kg), Muaro Pingai (4 μg/kg), and Paninggahan (10 μg/kg). DDT was also detected at Tanjung Mutuih at a level of 3 μg/kg. Other compounds such as Heptachlor and Endrin were not detected both in surface water and in mussel from all sampling sites studied. The results indicate that organochlorine residue can still be found in the environment, with its level in mussels being higher than in surface water.},

	abstract = {Microplastic is now ubiquitous in freshwater, sediment and biota, globally. This is as a consequence of inputs from, for example, waste mismanagement, effluents from wastewater treatment plants and surface runoff from agricultural areas. In this study, we investigated point source pollution of plastic to an upland stream, originating from a recycling plant that recycles polyethylene film in a remote area of Norway. Sediment ({\textasciitilde}2 kg) and macroinvertebrates (549 individuals in total) were sampled at one site upstream and two sites downstream of the recycling plant to study microplastic deposition and food web uptake. In total, 340 microplastic films were identified through a combination of visual and µFTIR analysis in the sediment samples. This corresponded to a concentration of 0.23 (± 0.057) items per g sediment upstream of the plastic recycling plant and 0.45 (± 0.017) and 0.58 (± 0.34) items per g downstream. The dominant plastic polymer was polyethylene, which increased significantly downstream of the plastic recycling plant. This indicates the role of the plastic recycling plant as a point source for microplastic in this catchment. Among the three sites investigated, a fairly constant concentration of polypropylene was found, indicating a diffuse source of polypropylene films across the catchment possibly relating to low-intensity agricultural land-use. Low levels of polyethylene were also observed upstream, which may be linked to either local or longer-distance atmospheric transport. Despite the considerable presence of microplastic in sediments, concentrations in macroinvertebrates were extremely low with only a single microplastic particle identified in the total of 549 macroinvertebrates—belonging to three different feeding groups—investigated. Our study suggests that: 1) microplastic pollution can be transferred to remote areas as unintended losses from recycling facilities, 2) remote areas with limited land-use pressure still have detectable levels of microplastic and 3) microplastic is only taken up by stream macroinvertebrates to a limited degree despite relatively high sediment concentrations, and thus there are no strong indications for ecological risks posed by microplastic to this ecological group at this location.},

	abstract = {Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are an abundant anseriform migratory wild bird species worldwide and an important reservoir for the maintenance of low pathogenicity (LP) avian influenza viruses (AIV). They have also been implicated in the spread of high pathogenicity (HP) AIV after spill-over events from HPAIV-infected poultry. The spread of HPAIV within wild water bird populations may lead to viral contamination of natural habitats. The role of small shallow water bodies as a transmission medium of AIV among mallards is investigated here in three experimental settings. (i) Delayed onset but rapid progression of infection seeded by two mallards inoculated with either LP or HP AIV to each eight sentinel mallards was observed in groups with access to a small 100 L water pool. In contrast, groups with a bell drinker as the sole source of drinking water showed a rapid onset but lengthened course of infection. (ii) HPAIV infection also set off when virus was dispersed in the water pool; titres as low as 102 TCID50 L−1 (translating to 0.1 TCID50 mL−1) proved to be sufficient. (iii) Substantial loads of viral RNA (and infectivity) were also found on the surface of the birds’ breast plumage. “Unloading” of virus infectivity from contaminated plumage into water bodies may be an efficient mechanism of virus spread by infected mallards. However, transposure of HPAIV via the plumage of an uninfected mallard failed. We conclude, surface water in small shallow water bodies may play an important role as a mediator of AIV infection of aquatic wild birds.},

The purpose of this study was to analyse, for the first time, the impact of DCF at different concentrations (50 mg/l, 5 mg/l, 0.5 mg/l, 0.05 mg/l) on A. lixula embryos and gametes to indicate possible safe minimum levels of release of this drug in marine environments. Our results showed significant concentration-dependent effects on embryonic development (decrease in the number of developed embryos and increase in the quantity of degenerated eggs) and significant levels of bioaccumulation at DCF concentrations of 50 mg/l in both gametes and embryos. DCF showed a significant impact on the fertilisation of A. lixula due to its effects on gametes, confirming the possibility of environmental risk and highlighting the need to improve wastewater treatment and drug disposal processes.},

	abstract = {Microbial drug discovery programs rely heavily on accessing bacterial diversity from the environment to acquire new specialized metabolite (SM) lead compounds for the therapeutic pipeline. Therefore, knowledge of how commonly culturable bacterial taxa are distributed in nature, in addition to the degree of variation of SM production within those taxa, is critical to informing these front-end discovery efforts and making the overall sample collection and bacterial library creation process more efficient. In the current study, we employed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and the bioinformatics pipeline IDBac to analyze diversity within phylotype groupings and SM profiles of hundreds of bacterial isolates from two Eunapius fragilis freshwater sponges, collected 1.5 km apart. We demonstrated that within two sponge samples of the same species, the culturable bacterial populations contained significant overlap in approximate genus-level phylotypes but mostly nonoverlapping populations of isolates when grouped lower than the level of genus. Further, correlations between bacterial phylotype and SM production varied at the species level and below, suggesting SM distribution within bacterial taxa must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Our results suggest that two E. fragilis freshwater sponges collected in similar environments can exhibit large culturable diversity on a species-level scale, thus researchers should scrutinize the isolates with analyses that take both phylogeny and SM production into account to optimize the chemical space entering into a downstream bacterial library.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0278070},
	abstract = {Detritivores are essential to nutrient cycling, but are often neglected in trophic networks, due to difficulties with determining their diet. DNA analysis of gut contents shows promise of trophic link discrimination, but many unknown factors limit its usefulness. For example, DNA can be rapidly broken down, especially by digestion processes, and DNA provides only a snapshot of the gut contents at a specific time. Few studies have been performed on the length of time that prey DNA can be detected in consumer guts, and none so far using benthic detritivores. Eutrophication, along with climate change, is altering the phytoplankton communities in aquatic ecosystems, on which benthic detritivores in aphotic soft sediments depend. Nutrient-poor cyanobacteria blooms are increasing in frequency, duration, and magnitude in many water bodies, while nutrient-rich diatom spring blooms are shrinking in duration and magnitude, creating potential changes in diet of benthic detritivores. We performed an experiment to identify the taxonomy and quantify the abundance of phytoplankton DNA fragments on bivalve gut contents, and how long these fragments can be detected after consumption in the Baltic Sea clam Macoma balthica. Two common species of phytoplankton (the cyanobacteria Nodularia spumigena or the diatom Skeletonema marinoi) were fed to M. balthica from two regions (from the northern and southern Stockholm archipelago). After removing the food source, M. balthica gut contents were sampled every 24 hours for seven days to determine the number of 23S rRNA phytoplankton DNA copies and when the phytoplankton DNA could no longer be detected by quantitative PCR. We found no differences in diatom 18S rRNA gene fragments of the clams by region, but the southern clams showed significantly more cyanobacteria 16S rRNA gene fragments in their guts than the northern clams. Interestingly, the cyanobacteria and diatom DNA fragments were still detectable by qPCR in the guts of M. balthica one week after removal from its food source. However, DNA metabarcoding of the 23S rRNA phytoplankton gene found in the clam guts showed that added food (i.e. N. spumigena and S. marinoi) did not make up a majority of the detected diet. Our results suggest that these detritivorous clams therefore do not react as quickly as previously thought to fresh organic matter inputs, with other phytoplankton than large diatoms and cyanobacteria constituting the majority of their diet. This experiment demonstrates the viability of using molecular methods to determine feeding of detritivores, but further studies investigating how prey DNA signals can change over time in benthic detritivores will be needed before this method can be widely applicable to both models of ecological functions and conservation policy.},

	abstract = {In the endeavour to understand the causes and consequences of the variation in animal personality, a wide range of studies were carried out, utilising various aspects to make sense of this biological phenomenon. One such aspect integrated the study of physiological traits, investigating hypothesised physiological correlates of personality. Although many of such studies were carried out on vertebrates (predominantly on birds and mammals), studies using arthropods (mainly insects) as model organisms were also at the forefront of this area of research. In order to review the current state of knowledge on the relationship between personality and the most frequently studied physiological parameters in arthropods, we searched for scientific articles that investigated this relationship. In our review, we only included papers utilising a repeated-measures methodology to be conceptually and formally concordant with the study of animal personality. Based on our literature survey, metabolic rate, thermal physiology, immunophysiology, and endocrine regulation, as well as exogenous agents (such as toxins) were often identified as significant affectors shaping animal personality in arthropods. We found only weak support for state-dependence of personality when the state is approximated by singular elements (or effectors) of condition. We conclude that a more comprehensive integration of physiological parameters with condition may be required for a better understanding of state’s importance in animal personality. Also, a notable knowledge gap persists in arthropods regarding the association between metabolic rate and hormonal regulation, and their combined effects on personality. We discuss the findings published on the physiological correlates of animal personality in arthropods with the aim to summarise current knowledge, putting it into the context of current theory on the origin of animal personality.},

	abstract = {Cultural ecosystem services (CES) contribute to people's physical, emotional, and mental well-being. CES research has significantly increased in recent years. However, most studies focused on the Global North, and most publications, primarily focused on recreation, (eco)tourism, and aesthetic values. Even fewer studies focus on the gendered dimensions of CES. I address these research gaps by investigating local perspectives of CES provided mangrove forests in northern Ecuador to identify how mangrove ecosystems support local well-being. I conducted ethnographic research to capture an inventory of mangrove CES through in-depth interviews with 40 local mangrove users over 14 weeks in Bolívar, a mangrove-dependent community in Esmeraldas province, Ecuador. The findings show that mangrove users assign profound cultural importance and personal attachments to the mangrove ecosystem. They describe a reciprocal relationship with the ecosystem where mangroves provide numerous "services" for the community, and mangrove users reciprocate with protection and caregiving. The findings also show that women have a higher appreciation of mangrove CES and are more socially, culturally, and emotionally connected to the mangrove ecosystem than men. I argue that researchers can employ ethnographic research methods to identify a more extensive range of CES, particularly non-material dimensions of ecosystem services often undervalued or overlooked in traditional economic valuation assessments. Such approaches can help develop management strategies that are environmentally and socially just and promote environmental decision-making that minimizes unintended consequences imposed on human populations that rely on ecosystems for their livelihoods and cultural survival.},

	abstract = {Unimpeded transfer and spread of invasive species throughout freshwater systems is of global concern, altering species compositions, disrupting ecosystem processes, and diverting economic resources. The magnitude and complexity of the problem is amplified by the global connectedness of human movements and the multiple modes of inter-basin transport of aquatic invasive species. Our objective was to trace the fishing behavior of anglers delineating potential pathways of transfer of invasive species throughout the vast inland waters of the Great Lakes of North America, which contain more than 21\% of the world's surface freshwater and are among the most highly invaded aquatic ecosystems in the world. Combining a comprehensive survey and a spatial analysis of the movements of thousands of anglers in 12 states within the US portion of the Great Lakes Basin and the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River Basins, we estimated that 6.5 million licensed anglers in the study area embarked on an average of 30 fishing trips over the course of the year, and 70\% of the individuals fished in more than one county. Geospatial linkages showed direct connections made by individuals traveling between 99\% of the 894 counties where fishing occurred, and between 61 of the 66 sub-watersheds in a year. Estimated numbers of fishing trips to individual counties ranged from 1199–1.95 million; generally highest in counties bordering the Great Lakes. Of these, 79 had more than 10,000 estimated fishing trips originating from anglers living in other counties. Although angler movements are one mechanism of invasive species transfer, there likely is a high cumulative probability of invasive species transport by several million people fishing each year throughout this extensive freshwater network. A comprehensive georeferenced survey, coupled with a spatial analysis of fishing destinations, provides a potentially powerful tool to track, predict, curtail and control the transfer and proliferation of invasive species in freshwater.

	abstract = {Phylogeography is an integrative field of science linking micro- and macro-evolutionary processes, contributing to the inference of vicariance, dispersal, speciation, and other population-level processes. Phylogeographic surveys usually require considerable effort and time to obtain numerous samples from many geographical sites covering the distribution range of target species; this associated high cost limits their application. Recently, environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has been useful not only for detecting species but also for assessing genetic diversity; hence, there has been growing interest in its application to phylogeography. As the first step of eDNA-based phylogeography, we examined (1) data screening procedures suitable for phylogeography and (2) whether the results obtained from eDNA analysis accurately reflect known phylogeographic patterns. For these purposes, we performed quantitative eDNA metabarcoding using group-specific primer sets in five freshwater fish species belonging to two taxonomic groups from a total of 94 water samples collected from western Japan. As a result, three-step data screening based on the DNA copy number of each haplotype detected successfully eliminated suspected false positive haplotypes. Furthermore, eDNA analysis could almost perfectly reconstruct the phylogenetic and phylogeographic patterns obtained for all target species with the conventional method. Despite existing limitations and future challenges, eDNA-based phylogeography can significantly reduce survey time and effort and is applicable for simultaneous analysis of multiple species in single water samples. eDNA-based phylogeography has the potential to revolutionise phylogeography.

Monitoring programs in these lakes can be limited in scope due to sampling logistics, leaving an incomplete picture of how the systems may be impacted by environmental stressors. Here, we used diatoms as early indicators of change in relatively undisturbed lakes from five national park units in the US Great Lakes region. Surface sediment samples were collected repeatedly over more than a decade to analyze the diatom community turnover. This diatom community assemblage data were compared with the measured water quality data collected over the same period in order to identify the predominant drivers of ecological change. Even though the parks in this study span two biomes, and lake characteristics vary between and within parks, we found synchronicity in measured water quality trends and diatom responses. Changes in the thermal regime and water‐column mixing appeared to drive much of the change across parks, although much of the diatom turnover also followed a sulfate or pH gradient. Nutrients did not appear to play a major role in diatom community change. This method of using diatoms in conjunction with water quality monitoring allows for an integrated response over a number of years and provides managers with a complementary tool to determine which environmental parameters are having the biggest effect on lake ecology.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.13139},
	abstract = {We introduce a new method of estimating accepted species diversity by adapting mark-recapture methods to comparisons of taxonomic databases. A taxonomic database should become more complete over time, so the error bar on an estimate of its completeness and the known diversity of the taxon it treats will decrease. Independent databases can be correlated, so we use the time course of estimates comparing them to understand the effect of correlation. If a later estimate is significantly larger than an earlier one, the databases are positively correlated, if it is significantly smaller, they are negatively correlated, and if the estimate remains roughly constant, then the correlations have averaged out. We tested this method by estimating how complete MolluscaBase is for accepted names of terrestrial gastropods. Using random samples of names from an independent database, we determined whether each name led to a name accepted in MolluscaBase. A sample tested in August 2020 found that 16.7\% of tested names were missing; one in July 2021 found 5.3\% missing. MolluscaBase grew by almost 3,000 accepted species during this period, reaching 27,050 species. The estimates ranged from 28,409 ± 365 in 2021 to 29,063 ± 771 in 2020. All estimates had overlapping 95\% confidence intervals, indicating that correlations between the databases did not cause significant problems. Uncertainty beyond sampling error added 475 ± 430 species, so our estimate for accepted terrestrial gastropods species at the end of 2021 is 28,895 ± 630 species. This estimate is more than 4,000 species higher than previous ones. The estimate does not account for ongoing flux of species into and out of synonymy, new discoveries, or changing taxonomic methods and concepts. The species naming curve for terrestrial gastropods is still far from reaching an asymptote, and combined with the additional uncertainties, this means that predicting how many more species might ultimately be recognized is presently not feasible. Our methods can be applied to estimate the total number of names of Recent mollusks (as opposed to names currently accepted), the known diversity of fossil mollusks, and known diversity in other phyla.},

	abstract = {Nitellopsis obtusa ([Desvaux] J. Groves [1919]; Characeae), known as starry stonewort, is an invasive macroalga in Laurentian Great Lakes states and provinces in North America. Because of its potential negative impacts on native ecosystems and recreation, N. obtusa has become a high-priority target for management. However, there is a critical lack of foundational information on the efficacy of different algaecides, and concentrations thereof, for N. obtusa control. Additionally, control of N. obtusa bulbils—asexual reproductive structures that are the main pathway for the establishment of new plants—has proven difficult. We tested the efficacy of six commonly used copper-based algaecides, at a series of copper concentrations up to the maximum labeled rate, on N. obtusa thalli (photosynthetic aboveground tissues) and bulbils in controlled laboratory experiments. Bulbils were placed above and below sediment in separate experiments to evaluate whether sediment acted as a barrier to treatment. At 14 days after treatment (DAT), there were significant reductions in thalli biomass (34\% and 40\%) for two algaecides at the highest concentration evaluated (1.0 mg Cu L-1) and significant thalli discoloration at 0.75 and 1.0 mg Cu L-1 for four algaecides. There were no significant negative effects on N. obtusa thalli biomass or discoloration at lower concentrations of any product. For below-sediment bulbils, none of the algaecides reduced N. obtusa viability compared to untreated controls by 56 DAT, and viability was significantly greater than in controls for three different algaecides at 0.25 mg Cu L-1. For above-sediment bulbils, there was low sprouting across all algaecide treatments and untreated controls, indicating inhospitable growing conditions. These findings provide a baseline for improvement of chemical treatment options for N. obtusa, provide guidance for future research on N. obtusa control, and underscore the challenges in achieving sustained N. obtusa control.},

The growth rate of mussels (3.0–6.7 mm year−1) in the gulf was in the low range, but the mean wet biomass gain (1.50 kg m−1 normalized culture rope) was among the highest in the Baltic. After a two-year growth period, one tonne of mussels fixed in their soft tissues from 93 to 98 kg N t−1 and 11 kg P t−1. The cost-benefit analysis revealed a negative budget balance of production for human consumption, with a total income covering only 12.0\% of the cumulative costs. Mussel farming in the gulf can therefore only be justified to improve the environmental quality if additional funding mechanisms are put in place to support farming activity.},

Ballast water release from transoceanic shipping is deemed responsible for 65\% of invasions in the basin since the modern St. Lawrence Seaway opened in 1959. Regulations requiring mid‐ocean exchange of ballast water applied in 1993 failed to stem ship‐mediated invasions because the procedure was not mandated for all ships. In 2006 and 2008, Canada and the United States, respectively, mandated that all transoceanic ships should conduct open ocean flushing to ensure that partially filled ballast tanks intended for discharge into the Great Lakes contained water of salinity ≥30 ppt before entering the Seaway. These regulations have been strictly enforced through record inspections and tests of ballast tank salinities of inbound ships. Before‐and‐after comparisons of total organismal abundance and species richness in ballast tanks revealed a substantial reduction in invasion risk from ships that conducted saltwater flushing. Since 2006, the rate of discovery of newly established non‐native species in the Great Lakes declined by 85\% to its lowest level in two centuries. While multiple factors could plausibly contribute to this decline, empirical evidence supports the 2006/2008 ballast water regulation as the primary cause, highlighting the benefit of internationally coordinated vector control.},

	abstract = {Heavy metals have a high density that is harmful even in low quantity. These metals enter aquatic habitats through various sources, home effluents, including industrial waste, atmospheric sources, and other metal-based businesses, as well as E-Waste. Heavy metal pollution is responsible for degenerating aquatic species, creating physical abnormalities in creatures and contaminating the aquatic environment. These poisonous heavy metals cause a variety of fish ailments like decrease in hatching rate, teratogenesis and bioaccumulation in the tissues etc. The contamination of heavy metals in aquatic bodies and ecosystems has a significant influence on the food chain. Because fish people consume fish, it has an indirect impact on their health. These heavy metals also have a higher impact on the environment because they remain for longer periods and have bio-accumulative capabilities, leading water health to deteriorate. This study offers insight into the disruption of fish and human physiology, their reproductive ability by heavy metals. This review provides baseline data on the heavy metals and aquatic environment, especially fish and human health. The data will increase sensitivity to preventing and managing aquatic environmental pollution, particularly heavy metal contamination.},

	abstract = {Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a rapid molecular detection technique that has been used as a diagnostic tool for detecting human and animal pathogens for over 20 years and is promising for detecting environmental DNA shed by invasive species. We designed a LAMP assay to detect the invasive carps, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella). To determine the sensitivity of the LAMP assay, we determined limit of detection (LOD) for each invasive carp species and compared with the performance of a grass carp quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay in LOD and in a mesocosm study. We used two grass carp densities, 3 juvenile grass carp in one mesocosm and 33 juvenile grass carp in the other. Prior to adding grass carp to the mesocosms, we added 68 kg of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) to each mesocosm to simulate farm ponds used for raising bait fish. We filtered 500 mL of water per sample to compare LAMP and qPCR analysis, and we collected 50 mL grab samples that were only analyzed using qPCR to gain additional data using a higher-throughput method to monitor environmental DNA (eDNA) levels throughout the study period. No eDNA for any of the four invasive carp species was detected in water collected from the mesocosms during the three days prior to adding grass carp. Forty-eight hours after grass carp addition to mesocosms, we detected grass carp eDNA in the mesocosm containing 33 grass carp using the LAMP assay. However, we failed to detect any grass carp DNA in the mesocosm containing 3 grass carp with the LAMP assay throughout the study. We analyzed the data using an occupancy model and found that the 500 mL filter samples yielded a higher eDNA capture probability than 50 mL grab samples in the mesocosm containing three grass carp but had similar eDNA capture probability in the mesocosm containing 33 grass carp. Both LAMP and qPCR reliably detected grass carp eDNA 2 days after grass carp addition, but detections were more consistent with qPCR. The LAMP assay may have utility for certain niche uses because it can be used to rapidly analyze eDNA samples and is robust to inhibition, despite having some limitations.},

Here we investigate its distribution, population density and size classes distribution in the main course of the river, in the territory of the South Adda Regional Park. Furthermore, we defined its level of invasiveness using two different risk screening methods, in order to obtain a more comprehensive evaluation of its potential impacts: AS-ISK (Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit) and Harmonia+. Finally, we compared the resulting invasiveness level with the output of the GISS (Generic Impact Scoring System) method, also used by IUCN. Our data confirm that the invasive amphipod is well-established in the downstream part of the River Adda, and its distribution seems related to hydrodynamism. Interestingly, its level of invasiveness was evaluated as low by Harmonia+ and high by AS-ISK: this discrepancy is due to different evaluations of environmental and socio-economic impacts of a non-native species carried out by the two methods. Finally, we propose some possible actions to reduce the spreading rate of this invasive amphipod in this area.},

	abstract = {Although rivers support significant unionid mussel (Unionida: Unionidae) diversity, Gulf of Mexico tributary rivers have been subject to changes in water quality and habitat due to altered watershed land use. We quantified mussel species richness and relative abundance and environmental factors in small tributary streams of the Pearl River, Mississippi-Louisiana. Freshwater mussel and habitat surveys were conducted at 27 stream sampling sites over two summers (9 sites revisited), and coverage of seven land use categories and seven geological categories above each reach were calculated. Mussels were patchily distributed (53\% of sites sampled yielded mussels) and typically not abundant (only 26\% of sites yielded {\textgreater}10 mussels). Surveys revealed nine species, with total abundance ranging from 0–66 mussels and richness ranging from 0–5 species per site. Assemblages were driven by an upper to lower watershed gradient of decreasing CPUE and richness, with microhabitat and water quality, land cover, and geology locally modifying this gradient. Environmental variables did not seem of sufficient magnitude to account for the patchy distributions and low abundances of mussels at most study sites, and we hypothesize that high discharge events related to tropical storm passage may have exerted an overriding influence on mussel assemblages in these streams through direct mortality and/or altered availability of suitable glochidial hosts.},

Seven benthic macroinvertebrates and seven fish IAS were identified. The crayfish Faxonius limosus was frequently found and abundant in the tributaries. The mussels Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, and Sinanodonta woodiana dominated in the Danube River and the middle and lower reaches of the tributaries, while the fish Carassius gibelio, Perccottus glenii, and Lepomis gibbosus were most abundant in the standing water bodies. The integrated biocontamination estimated by taxonomic groups (crayfish, molluscs, and fish), sampling methods, and type of water bodies ranged from moderate in the shoreline zone of the Danube River, through moderate to high in the canals and lakes, to severe in the Danube tributaries and the reservoirs. The results demonstrate the importance of IAS in the assessment of the ecological status/potential of the water bodies in the DRB.

To the best of our knowledge, the overall effects of damming, environment, space, time, and invasive alien mollusk species, on structural and functional responses of native mollusk communities were not yet compared. Using historical information and recent data from a river, we aimed to investigate and disentangle these effects and evaluate the differences in structural and functional responses of natives and alien invasives to the same predictors. Variation partitioning showed that alien species were as important predictors as were environmental factors and time in explaining species composition of native freshwater mollusk communities. Aliens were more independent of environmental conditions than natives and responded to different drivers, partially explaining their invasion success. The increased abundance of some alien gastropods was positively related to taxonomic diversity, while certain alien bivalves were negatively associated with the functional diversity of native communities. We introduce a cumulative variation partitioning with multiple response (native and alien) and predictor matrices, along with a diagram to show their relations, advocating for a conceptual shift in future community ecology, from “variables to matrices” and from “multivariate analyses to multi-matrix statistical modeling”.},

With populations on the decline worldwide, freshwater mussels are of conservation concern. In this study, we explore the propensity of the invasive Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) fish to prey upon indigenous freshwater mussels. First, we conducted lab experiments where Round Gobies were given the opportunity to feed on juvenile unionid mussels and macroinvertebrates, revealing rates and preferences of consumption. Several Round Gobies consumed whole freshwater mussels during these experiments, as confirmed by mussel counts and x-ray images of the fishes. Next, we investigated Round Gobies collected from stream habitats of the French Creek watershed, which is renowned for its unique and rich aquatic biodiversity. We developed a novel DNA metabarcoding method to identify the specific species of mussels consumed by Round Goby and provide a new database of DNA gene sequences for 25 indigenous unionid mussel species. Several of the fishes sampled had consumed indigenous mussels, including the Elktoe (non-endangered), Creeper (non-endangered), Long Solid (state endangered), and Rayed Bean (federally endangered) species. The invasive Round Goby poses a growing threat to unionid mussels, including species of conservation concern. The introduction of the invasive Round Goby to freshwaters of North America is shaping ecosystem transitions within the aquatic critical zone having widespread implications for conservation and management.},

Climate change may aggravate these environmental problems through changing temperatures, reduced precipitation, enhancing the adverse impact of excess nutrient discharge, and the entry of invasive species. In this study, we analyse the main European inland waterway corridors and their branches to assess the ecological viability of a pan-European inland waterway network. The environmental viability of such network depends on the right assessment of ecosystem services and protection of biodiversity.

	abstract = {Background 
The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) has estimated that invasive alien species (IAS) might cause billions of dollars of losses every year across the world. One example is South-East Asia, where IAS have caused an estimated loss of 33.5 billion USD, affecting the environment, human health, and agricultural production. Factors associated with climate change, such as increased carbon dioxide (CO2), heavy precipitation, and elevated temperatures is expected to facilitate biological invasion, leading only to further financial and public health loss. Thus, further study is needed to identify, collate and categorise what evidence exists on the impacts of climate change on fish and shellfish species that contribute to the list of “One Hundred of the World’s Worst Invasive Alien Species” as identified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN). Such mapping will identify regions more at risk of biological invasion as climate change progresses.
Methods
We outline a systematic mapping review protocol that follows the Guideline and Standards for Evidence Synthesis in Environmental Management and RepOrting standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES). We describe how peer-reviewed articles will be collected from Web of Science and Scopus, and then analyzed to create knowledge maps on the impact climate change has on invasive species. Finally, we speculate on how our results will aid future management of invasive species in the light of climate change.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, I explored the abiotic and biotic factors that explain the variation in reproduction, survival, and individual growth of the Florida Apple Snail (Pomacea paludosa), and I combined reproduction, survival, and individual growth to determine the factors limiting Florida Apple Snail populations. First, I examined how the variation in reproduction of the Florida Apple Snail and another non-native congener (P. maculata) can be explained by depth, temperature, photoperiod, and adult densities. I also examined how metaphyton total phosphorus (TP) influenced individual growth rates of both species. I found that P. paludosa optimally reproduce in shallower water than P. maculata, that both species respond positively to increased metaphyton TP, and that P. paludosa respond weaker to variation in metaphtyon TP than P. maculata. Then, I examined individual growth across seasons, and examined how size-dependent survival varied across seasons in and out of the presence predators. I also investigated predators that strongly influence survival rates. I found that individual growth was slower in the dry season than the wet season, that survival was not size-dependent nor seasonal when predators were excluded from cages, and that survival was size-dependent in the dry season but not the wet season when in the presence of predators. Greater Sirens and Giant Water Bugs were found to be strong predators of P. paludosa {\textless} 10 mm Shell Length (SL), Greater Siren and Giant Water Bugs seasonal abundances were responsible for the differences in size-dependent survival across seasons. Finally, I incorporated differences in ideal hydrological and temperature conditions for reproduction, seasonal differences in individual growth, and changes in survival in and out of the presence of predators onto a zero-population growth isocline. I found that optimal hydrological and temperature conditions, and increased growth in the dry season, could not make up for losses of snails {\textless} 10 mm SL by predators which suggested that predators are limiting P. paludosa populations in our study area.},

	abstract = {Although most studies of digenetic trematodes of the family Schistosomatidae dwell on representatives causing human schistosomiasis, the majority of the 130 identified species of schistosomes infect birds or non-human mammals. The cercariae of many of these species can cause swimmer’s itch when they penetrate human skin. Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in our understanding of schistosome diversity, now encompassing 17 genera with eight more lineages awaiting description. Collectively, schistosomes exploit 16 families of caenogastropod or heterobranch gastropod intermediate hosts. Basal lineages today are found in marine gastropods and birds, but subsequent diversification has largely taken place in freshwater, with some reversions to marine habitats. It seems increasingly likely that schistosomes have on two separate occasions colonized mammals. Swimmer’s itch is a complex zoonotic disease manifested through several different routes of transmission involving a diversity of different host species. Swimmer’s itch also exemplifies the value of adopting the One Health perspective in understanding disease transmission and abundance because the schistosomes involved have complex life cycles that interface with numerous species and abiotic components of their aquatic environments. Given the progress made in revealing their diversity and biology, and the wealth of questions posed by itch-causing schistosomes, they provide excellent models for implementation of long-term interdisciplinary studies focused on issues pertinent to disease ecology, the One Health paradigm, and the impacts of climate change, biological invasions and other environmental perturbations.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryThe diversity of life on Earth is declining due to human decisions and human actions. Scientists have clearly identified categories of human-induced environmental distress, and public awareness is growing, yet science and related media reports are not affecting enough policy change to forestall our impact. Additional approaches need to be taken, and one potent vehicle for eliciting responses is art. Some visual artists have chosen to include insects in their work. Insects are diverse, abundant, ecologically and culturally important to us, and are suffering declines by our hand. These qualities, coupled with insects’ uncanny ability to evoke emotional extremes, marks them as uniquely powerful subjects for artists to convey messages about our relationship with the planet. We surveyed relevant work by 73 artists and found a bias favoring insect art addressing habitat destruction or climate change, and an underrepresentation of art related to several other important categories of environmental destruction. Art favored Hymenoptera over all other insect orders, including orders containing more described species. Noting these misalignments, we see opportunities for artists to more extensively explore insect diversity and the harm we are causing, and for art to increasingly play a complementary role in affecting change in our destructive behavior.AbstractHumans are reshaping the planet in impressive, and impressively self-destructive, ways. Evidence and awareness of our environmental impact has failed to elicit meaningful change in reversing our behavior. A multifaceted approach to communicating human-induced environmental destruction is critical, and art can affect our behavior by its power to evoke emotions. Artists often use insects in their works because of our intimate and varied relationship with this diverse, abundant lineage of animals. We surveyed work by 73 artists featuring insects or insect bodily products to gauge how extensively artists are addressing anthropogenic environmental distress, and what insects they are choosing as subjects in the process. Categories often cited as contributing to species extinction are (1) habitat destruction, (2) invasive species, (3) pollution, (4) human population, and (5) overharvesting. After adding insect-specific categories of (6) decline of insect pollinators and (7) the intentional modification or extermination of insects, we categorized our surveyed works, confirming categorizations with 53 of the living artists. Forty-seven percent of the artists addressed habitat destruction or climate change, but some other categories were severely underrepresented, with almost no work explicitly addressing overpopulation or overharvesting. Artists favored Hymenoptera (62\%) over potentially more species-rich orders. Recognizing these biases could alert scientists, artists, and others to more effectively communicate messages of universal importance.},

Despite a wealth of studies on their shell matrix and byssus proteins, few studies have focused on the extracellular matrix molecules in mussel soft tissues. Extracellular matrix molecules may play important roles in biomineralization, immune reaction, and tissue homeostasis. In the present study, extracellular matrix and mineralization-related molecules in zebra mussel soft tissue were immunolocalized using well-characterized monoclonal antibodies. Our results demonstrate specific immunolocalization for collagen IV, fibronectin, and keratan sulfate in hemocytes; collagen IV in peripheral nerves; and aggrecan, link protein, and collagen XVIII in foot tissue. Laminin, decorin, and osteonectin were also broadly immunolocalized in mussel soft tissues. The distributions of these extracellular matrix molecules in mussel tissues are in line with the cell-mediated shell mineralization hypothesis, providing evidence for the molecules involved in the peripheral nervous system and byssus formation, and explaining the conservation of extracellular matrix molecules during evolution. These results further contribute to establishing zebra mussels as an attractive animal model in biomedical research.},

These differences could be attributed to different environmental conditions and/or different host behavior. To test this hypothesis, we compared epizoon of D. polymorpha and U. tumidus placed in identical mesocosm conditions, in which Unio could not move vertically due to the lack of sediments. Half of the mesocosms contained D. polymorpha, the other half comprised U. tumidus. Each species of mollusks was kept in the mesocosms with eutrophic and mesotrophic conditions. Finally, we established four treatments that were replicated in triplicate mesocosms. Mesocosm experiments showed that epizoon communities of U. tumidus were even more abundant than that of D. polymorpha and their species richness was similar. Therefore, we concluded that previously revealed strong differences between epizoon communities of D. polymorpha and U. tumidus were related to the different environmental conditions and bivalve behavior.},

We examined the gut contents of adult blue catfish (567–1020 mm, n = 65), captured from a Mississippi River backwater using trammel nets. All items in diets were separated and enumerated, and all fish-like diet items were genetically identified to confirm species-level ID. Bigheaded carp ages were determined by sectioning hard structures (pectoral spines, post-cleithra, and vertebrae). Adult silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (age 3–5, mean = 3.9 years, SE = 0.2; n = 21) had the highest frequency of occurrence (70\%) and constituted the greatest percentage by number (58\%) and weight (60\%) in/of blue catfish diets. Gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum ranked second by all three measures (34\%, 25\%, and 26\%). Finally, 50\% to 100\% of probable age-based sizes of silver carp exceeded gape measurements of blue catfish, suggesting scavenging was the dominant means of predation. More intensive sampling efforts are required to determine the system-wide importance of bigheaded carp in blue catfish diets.},

Shell length was strongly correlated with both net and gross BD of mussels (P{\textless}0.0001). The mean FR was higher in river water (0.405±0.052 L g−1 h−1) than in lake water (0.304±0.051 L g−1 h−1). In contrast, the BD of mussels was higher in RW (0.671±0.609 mg g−1 h−1) than in LW (0.275±0.027 mg g−1 h−1). For algal species, the FR of mussels ranged from 0.114±0.024 to 0.553±0.019 L g−1 h−1. The FR of U. douglasiae was higher in river water (mainly diatoms), whereas BD was higher in lake water (mainly Microcystis). U. douglasiae did not prefer toxic M. aeruginosa, which was significantly accumulated in pseudofaeces and faeces. The maximum FR of U. douglasiae in algal bloom water was recorded at a water temperature of 25°C and water depth of 50 cm. Moreover, the in situ mortality of U. douglasiae was strongly affected by water temperature and nitrogen concentration. Overall, U. douglasiae can enhance water quality in eutrophic areas by removing dominant cyanobacteria, although its removal efficiency depends on environmental parameters and site of introduction.},

	doi = {10.5194/esd-13-711-2022},
	abstract = {Climate change has multiple effects on Baltic Sea species, communities and ecosystem functioning through changes in physical and biogeochemical environmental characteristics of the sea. Associated indirect and secondary effects on species interactions, trophic dynamics and ecosystem function are expected to be significant. We review studies investigating species-, population- and ecosystem-level effects of abiotic factors that may change due to global climate change, such as temperature, salinity, oxygen, pH, nutrient levels, and the more indirect biogeochemical and food web processes, primarily based on peer-reviewed literature published since 2010.For phytoplankton, clear symptoms of climate change, such as prolongation of the growing season, are evident and can be explained by the warming, but otherwise climate effects vary from species to species and area to area. Several modelling studies project a decrease of phytoplankton bloom in spring and an increase in cyanobacteria blooms in summer. The associated increase in N:P ratio may contribute to maintaining the “vicious circle of eutrophication”. However, uncertainties remain because some field studies claim that cyanobacteria have not increased and some experimental studies show that responses of cyanobacteria to temperature, salinity and pH vary from species to species. An increase of riverine dissolved organic matter (DOM) may also decrease primary production, but the relative importance of this process in different sea areas is not well known. Bacteria growth is favoured by increasing temperature and DOM, but complex effects in the microbial food web are probable. Warming of seawater in spring also speeds up zooplankton growth and shortens the time lag between phytoplankton and zooplankton peaks, which may lead to decreasing of phytoplankton in spring. In summer, a shift towards smaller-sized zooplankton and a decline of marine copepod species has been projected.In deep benthic communities, continued eutrophication promotes high sedimentation and maintains good food conditions for zoobenthos. If nutrient abatement proceeds, improving oxygen conditions will first increase zoobenthos biomass, but the subsequent decrease of sedimenting matter will disrupt the pelagic–benthic coupling and lead to a decreased zoobenthos biomass. In the shallower photic systems, heatwaves may produce eutrophication-like effects, e.g. overgrowth of bladderwrack by epiphytes, due to a trophic cascade. If salinity also declines, marine species such as bladderwrack, eelgrass and blue mussel may decline. Freshwater vascular plants will be favoured but they cannot replace macroalgae on rocky substrates. Consequently invertebrates and fish benefiting from macroalgal belts may also suffer. Climate-induced changes in the environment also favour establishment of non-indigenous species, potentially affecting food web dynamics in the Baltic Sea.As for fish, salinity decline and continuing of hypoxia is projected to keep cod stocks low, whereas the increasing temperature has been projected to favour sprat and certain coastal fish. Regime shifts and cascading effects have been observed in both pelagic and benthic systems as a result of several climatic and environmental effects acting synergistically.Knowledge gaps include uncertainties in projecting the future salinity level, as well as stratification and potential rate of internal loading, under different climate forcings. This weakens our ability to project how pelagic productivity, fish populations and macroalgal communities may change in the future. The 3D ecosystem models, food web models and 2D species distribution models would benefit from integration, but progress is slowed down by scale problems and inability of models to consider the complex interactions between species. Experimental work should be better integrated into empirical and modelling studies of food web dynamics to get a more comprehensive view of the responses of the pelagic and benthic systems to climate change, from bacteria to fish. In addition, to better understand the effects of climate change on the biodiversity of the Baltic Sea, more emphasis should be placed on studies of shallow photic environments.The fate of the Baltic Sea ecosystem will depend on various intertwined environmental factors and on development of the society. Climate change will probably delay the effects of nutrient abatement and tend to keep the ecosystem in its “novel” state. However, several modelling studies conclude that nutrient reductions will be a stronger driver for ecosystem functioning of the Baltic Sea than climate change. Such studies highlight the importance of studying the Baltic Sea as an interlinked socio-ecological system.},

	abstract = {Animals can impact freshwater ecosystem structure and function in ways that persist well beyond the animal’s active presence. These legacy effects can last for months, even decades, and often increase spatial and temporal heterogeneity within a system. Herein, we review examples of structural, biogeochemical, and trophic legacies from animals in stream and river ecosystems with a focus on large vertebrates. We examine how the decline or disappearance of many native animal populations has led to the loss of their legacy effects. We also demonstrate how anthropogenically altered animal populations, such as livestock and invasive species, provide new legacy effects that may partially replace lost animal legacies. However, these new effects often have important functional differences, including stronger, more widespread and homogenizing effects. Understanding the influence of animal legacy effects is particularly important as native animal populations continue to decline and disappear from many ecosystems, because they illustrate the long-term and often unanticipated consequences of biodiversity loss. We encourage the conservation and restoration of native species to ensure that both animal populations and their legacy effects continue to support the structure and function of river ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Management strategies to address the challenges associated with invasive species are critical for effective conservation. An increasing variety of mathematical models offer insight into invasive populations, and can help managers identify cost effective prevention, control, and eradication actions. Despite this, as model complexity grows, so does the inaccessibility of these tools to conservation practitioners making decisions about management. Here, we seek to narrow the science‐practice gap by reviewing invasive species management models (ISMMs). We define ISMMs as mechanistic models used to explore invasive species management strategies, and include reaction‐advection–diffusion models, integrodifference equations, gravity models, particle transport models, nonspatial and spatial discrete‐time population growth models, cellular automata, and individual‐based models. For each approach, we describe the model framework and its implementation, discuss strengths and weaknesses, and give examples of conservation applications. We conclude by discussing how ISMMs can be used in concert with adaptive management to address scientific uncertainties impeding action and with multiple objective decision processes to evaluate tradeoffs among management objectives. We undertook this review to support more effective decision‐making involving invasive species by providing conservation practitioners with the information they need to identify tools most useful for their applications.},

	abstract = {Multiple invasive species may interact, influencing one another and generating synergistic effects on food webs and ecosystem processes. We investigated the interaction between two non‐native species widespread in the western USA: common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia), an invasive riparian tree associated with di‐nitrogen fixation. Deep Creek, Idaho, was an International Biological Program site in the early 1970s; at that time, carp were rare and Russian olive was absent. Subsequently, Russian olive was introduced and established a dense stand, increasing allochthonous inputs and nitrogen‐rich benthic organic matter. Since 1971, carp density has increased {\textasciitilde}4× (an increase our bioenergetic analysis suggests could not have been sustained in the absence of Russian olive). Carp gut contents in 2013–2014 revealed, on average, {\textasciitilde}40\% olives, and, similarly, stable isotope analyses revealed {\textasciitilde}58\% of carp tissues were derived from olives. A small‐scale, short‐term experimental exclusion of these subsidized carp caused {\textasciitilde}3× increases in macrophytes and chlorophyll‐a, suggesting they may limit algae and macrophyte biomass. Moreover, carp that consumed olives excreted more nitrogen ({\textasciitilde}2× more ammonium, {\textasciitilde}2× more total dissolved nitrogen, and {\textasciitilde}3× more total nitrogen) compared to those that had not, which may amplify recycling and export from streams invaded by both species. This scenario is characteristic of an “invasional meltdown,” with attendant changes in food webs and ecosystem processes.},

	abstract = {The unique aquatic Pontocaspian (PC) biota of the Black Sea Basin (BSB) is in decline. The lack of detailed knowledge on the status and trends of species, populations, and communities hampers a thorough risk assessment and precludes effective conservation. This paper reviews PC biodiversity trends in the BSB (Bulgaria, Romania, Moldova, Ukraine, and Russia) using endemic mollusks as a model group. We aim to assess changes in PC habitats, community structure, and species distribution over the past century and to identify direct anthropogenic threats. The presence/absence data of target mollusk species were assembled from literature, reports, and personal observations. Pontocaspian biodiversity trends in the northwestern BSB coastal regions were established by comparing 20th‐ and 21st‐century occurrences. The direct drivers of habitat and biodiversity change were identified and documented. We found that a pronounced decline of PC species and communities is driven by (a) damming of rivers, (b) habitat modifications that disturbed previous natural salinity gradients and settings in the studied area, (c) pollution and eutrophication, (d) invasive alien species, and (e) climate change. Four out of the 10 studied regions, namely, the Danube Delta–Razim Lake system, Dniester Liman, Dnieper–Bug estuary, and Taganrog Bay–Don Delta, contain favorable ecological conditions for PC communities and still host threatened endemic PC mollusk species. Distribution data are incomplete, but the scale of deterioration of PC species and communities is evident from the assembled data, as are major direct threats. Pontocaspian biodiversity in the BSB is profoundly affected by human activities. Standardized observation and collection data as well as precise definition of PC biota and habitats are necessary for targeted conservation actions. This study will help to set the research and policy agenda required to improve data collection to accommodate effective conservation of the unique PC biota.},

	abstract = {Marine microplastics pollution is a major environmental concern in marine ecosystems worldwide, yet the biological impacts of microplastics on the coastal biota are not yet fully understood. We investigated the impact of suspended microplastics on the energy budget of the mussels Mytilus coruscus using the Cellular Energy Allocation (CEA) approach. The mussels were exposed to control conditions (no microplastics) or to one of the three concentrations of 2 μm polystyrene microspheres (10, 104, and 106 particles/L) for 14 days, followed by 7 days of recovery. Exposure to high concentrations of microplastics (104 or 106 particles/L) increased cellular energy demand (measured as the activity of the mitochondrial electron transport system, ETS) and depleted cellular energy stores (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins) in the mussels whereas exposure to 10 particles/L had no effect. Carbohydrate levels decreased already after 7 days of microplastics exposure and were restored after 7 days of recovery. In contrast, the tissue levels of lipids and proteins declined more slowly (after 14 days of exposure) and did not fully recover after 7 days following the removal of microplastics. Therefore, the total energy content and the CEA declined after 7-14 days of exposure to high microplastics concentrations, and remained suppressed during 7 days of subsequent recovery. These findings demonstrate a negative impact of microplastics on energy metabolism at the cellular level that cannot be restored during a short time recovery. Given a close link of CEA with the organismal energy balance, suppression of CEA by microplastics exposure suggests that bioenergetics disturbances might lead to decreases in growth and productivity of mussels’ populations in environments with heavy microplastics loads.},

	abstract = {Aquatic invasions are a major ecological and socio-economic concern. Management of invasive aquatic populations requires a robust understanding of the effectiveness and suitability of control methods. In this review, we consider multiple control options for the management of invasive aquatic amphipods, exploring their efficacy and application constraints. Technological opportunities (pheromone, RNAi, biotechnologies) and gaps in our understanding around control mechanisms are identified, with the aim to improve management success of this order. Within this review, the UK invasion of the killer shrimp, Dikerogammarus villosus (Sowinsky, 1894) is used as a case study of the best explored example of invasive amphipod control. This species has had a range of ecological, physiological, pathological, and experimental research conducted upon it, which is highlighted from a management perspective. This same data, where available, has been synthesised for 46 other invasive amphipods, to probe for weaknesses that future management methods can exploit and be developed around. Successful management examples for invasive amphipod species remain rare. A lack of currently available tested options severely limits the possibility for amphipod management, post establishment. For future management to be successful, further work is needed to develop targeted and specific control methods, which ideally, are cost effective, have no/little associated ecological impacts, and can be broadly applied in closed and open water systems. Our synthesis presents opportunities for the further, informed development of control systems for invasive amphipods.},

It provides background information on the utility of eDNA for invasive species management and points to various examples of its use across federal and international programs. It provides information on 1) why an invasive species manager should consider using eDNA, 2) deciding if eDNA can help with the manager’s surveillance needs, 3) important components to operational implementation, and 4) a high-level overview of the technical steps necessary for eDNA analysis. The goal of this paper is to assist invasive species managers in deciding if, when, and how to use eDNA for surveillance. If eDNA use is elected, the paper provides guidance on steps to ensure a clear understanding of the strengths and limitation of the methods and how results can be best utilized in the context of invasive species surveillance.},

	abstract = {Previous papers discussing the effectiveness of injurious wildlife listings under 18 U.S.C. 42(a) of the Lacey Act have emphasized failures while ignoring the many successes. We looked at the 120-year history of injurious listing and then determined the effectiveness of the listings since the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) gained the listing authority in 1940. We measured success by the effectiveness of listing relative to the stage of the invasion process – that is, whether or not a species was established at the time of listing, if it since established, and if it subsequently spread to other States. The USFWS started listing preemptively with its first rule in 1952 and has added the majority of species preemptively since then. We analyzed the 307 species that were listed for invasiveness (excluding species listed for other injurious reasons). Of those species, 288 (94\%) were listed preemptively (before they became established). Although we acknowledge that other factors may play a role, we consider species that were listed before establishment and remained not established as “very effective” listings. All 288 remained not established – a 100\% prevention rate when listed preemptively. Only 19 of the 307 species (6\%) were listed after establishment, and they remain established. The listings are considered “effective” for the 4\% that remained within the State(s) they were established in at listing and “ineffective” or “not applicable” for the 2\% that spread to other States. The rationale for listing established species is explained herein. We conclude that injurious species listings can be effective at any stage, but prohibiting the importation into the United States of high-risk species prior to their introduction and establishment into U.S. environments is very effective in preventing invasions, and this success has heretofore been overlooked.},

Developments in eDNA technologies have improved detection probabilities for rare, indicator, and invasive species over the past decade. However, standard lab analysis can take days or weeks before results are available and is prohibitive when rapid management decisions are required for mitigation. Here, we investigated the performance of a real-time quantitative PCR system for on-site eDNA detection of New Zealand mud snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum). Six sites in western Washington, USA were sampled using the rapid eDNA technique and traditional methods, with five samples per site. On-site eDNA detection of mud snails resulted in a 10\% increase in positive sites (16/30 = 53\% positive) relative to visual surveys (13/30 = 43\% positive). In addition, positive associations were observed between mud snail eDNA concentration (eDNA copies per reaction) and the number of mud snail individuals at each site (R2 = 0.78). We show that the rapid on-site eDNA technology can be effective for detection and quantification of New Zealand mud snails in freshwaters. This on-site eDNA detection approach could possibly be used to initiate management protocols that allow for more rapid responses during the onset of biological invasions.},

We searched for economic costs ofIASoccurring in Spain, by using the InvaCost database and requesting data to regional governments and national authorities, which resulted in over 3,000 cost entries. Considering only robust data (i.e. excluding extrapolated, potential (not-incurred or expected) and low reliability costs), economic costs in Spain were estimated at US\$ 261 million (€ 232 million) from 1997 to 2022. There was an increase from US\$ 4 million per year before 2000 to US\$ 15 million per year in the last years (from € 4 to 13 million). Robust data showed that most reported costs ofIASin Spain ({\textgreater} 90\%) corresponded to management costs, while damage costs were only found for 2 out of the 174 species with reported costs. Economic costs relied mostly on regional and inter-regional administrations that spent 66\% of costs in post-invasion management actions, contrary to all international guidelines, which recommend investing more in prevention. Regional administrations unequally reported costs. Moreover, 36\% of the invasive species, reported to incur management costs, were not included in national or European regulations (i.e. Black Lists), suggesting the need to review these policies; besides, neighbouring regions seem to manage different groups of species. We suggest the need of a national lead agency to effectively coordinate actions, facilitate communication and collaboration amongst regional governments, national agencies and neighbouring countries. This will motivate the continuity of long-lasting management actions and the increase in efforts to reportIAScosts by regional and inter-regional managers which will adequately provide information for future budgets gaining management effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) affect natural ecosystems and services fundamental to human well-being, human health and economies. However, the economic costs associated withIAShave been less studied than other impacts. This information can be particularly important for developing countries such as Argentina, where monetary resources for invasion management are scarce and economic costs are more impactful. The present study provides the first analysis of the economic cost ofIASin Argentina at the national level, using the InvaCost database (expanded with new data sources in Spanish), the first global compilation of the reported economic costs of invasions. We analyzed the temporal development of invasions costs, distinguishing costs according to the method reliability (i.e. reproducibility of the estimation methodology) and describing the economic costs of invasions by invaded environment, cost type, activity sector affected and taxonomic group ofIAS. The total economic cost ofIASin Argentina between 1995 and 2019 was estimated at US\$ 6,908 million. All costs were incurred and 93\% were highly reliable. The recorded costs were mainly related to terrestrial environments and the agricultural sector, with lack of costs in other sectors, making it difficult to discuss the actual distribution of invasion costs in Argentina. Nevertheless, the reported costs ofIASin this country are very high and yet likely much underestimated due to important data gaps and biases in the literature. Considering that Argentina has an underdeveloped economy, costs associated with biological invasions should be taken into consideration for preventing invasions, and to achieve a more effective use of available resources.},

	abstract = {Although the high costs of invasion are frequently cited and are a key motivation for environmental management and policy, synthesised data on invasion costs are scarce. Here, we quantify and examine the monetary costs of biological invasions in the United Kingdom (UK) using a global synthesis of reported invasion costs. Invasive alien species have cost the UK economy between US\$6.9 billion and \$17.6 billion (£5.4 – £13.7 billion) in reported losses and expenses since 1976. Most costs were reported for the entire UK or Great Britain (97\%); country-scale cost reporting for the UK's four constituent countries was scarce. Reports of animal invasions were the costliest (\$4.7 billion), then plant (\$1.3 billion) and fungal (\$206.7 million) invasions. Reported damage costs (i.e. excluding management costs) were higher in terrestrial (\$4.8 billion) than aquatic or semi-aquatic environments (\$29.8 million), and primarily impacted agriculture (\$4.2 billion). Invaders with earlier introduction years accrued significantly higher total invasion costs. Invasion costs have been increasing rapidly since 1976, and have cost the UK economy \$157.1 million (£122.1 million) per annum, on average. Published information on specific economic costs included only 42 of 520 invaders reported in the UK and was generally available only for the most intensively studied taxa, with just four species contributing 90\% of species-specific costs. Given that many of the invasive species lacking cost data are actively managed and have well-recognised impacts, this suggests that cost information is incomplete and that totals presented here are vast underestimates owing to knowledge gaps. Financial expenditure on managing invasions is a fraction (37\%) of the costs incurred through damage from invaders; greater investments in UK invasive species research and management are, therefore, urgently required.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenically influenced habitats are becoming increasingly impacted by multiple invasive species that can regionally control main ecological processes and functions. Management requires predictions of invasive species’ effects, but multiple invasions may cause unpredictable outcomes, for example, synergistic impacts or interactions among trophic levels causing trophic cascades. The Baltic Sea is prone to species invasions that increasingly occur at multiple trophic levels. We used a laboratory experiment to test whether multiple invasive predators may cause interactive effects in the Baltic Sea. In aquaria, we simulated a coastal community that has developed dominated by invasive species—the decapod predators Palaemon elegans and Rhithropanopeus harrisii, the amphipod grazer Gammarus tigrinus, and the filter‐feeder Dreissena polymorpha. The orthogonal experiment determined separate and interactive effects from predators on the lower trophic level invasive species and native algae including the foundation species Fucus radicans. The main result was that while both predators significantly impacted the community, in no cases were their effects interactive. Another important result was that P. elegans appeared to cause a trophic cascade, as in its presence F. radicans and its epiphytes had the greatest biomass while G. tigrinus grazers were heavily reduced. G. tigrinus were negatively correlated with F. radicans biomass, so variable amphipod grazing may be the link allowing an indirect effect of P. elegans on F. radicans. R. harrisii also reduced G. tigrinus abundance but did not affect F. radicans biomass. Both predators significantly affected the lengths of F. radicans plant stems that were comprised of new vegetative growth—P. elegans reduced the lengths of new vegetative tissue while R. harrisii increased it. Thus, the presence of P. elegans induced shorter and denser F. radicans bushes compared to taller and thinner bushes observed in other treatments. Lastly, R. harrisii caused significant declines in D. polymorpha numbers. Overall, ecological management needs to consider positive effects from predator invasion which may reduce grazing pressure on low trophic level foundation species. A trophic cascade involving two invasive species highlights the importance of multi‐species approaches to management of Baltic Sea invasive species and in other regions prone to biological invasions.},

	abstract = {In an effort to harmonize multi-jurisdictional surveillance and detection of aquatic invasive species, regional stakeholders have called for the development of a Great Lakes Aquatic Invasive Species Surveillance Framework to identify species that pose a risk to the basin, quantify the relative risk of various pathways of introduction, provide guidance on monitoring protocols for surveillance, and identify priority locations for surveillance based on this pathway assessment. Here, we screen 448 species to develop a surveillance list of 144 species that are relevant for Great Lakes surveillance: are not yet widespread throughout the basin, have a pathway through which they can arrive, are able to establish and are predicted to cause impacts. Using the Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Risk Assessment for consistent assessment across taxa, the surveillance species list consisted of 144 species: 64 plants, 4 algae, 40 fish, 5 mollusks, 28 crustaceans, 1 platyhelminthes and 2 bryozoans. While pathway risk varies by taxon, the highest risk pathways across all taxonomic groups are natural dispersal, hitchhiking/fouling, and intentional release. The taxonomic group predicted to have the most severe impacts on a per species basis is algae, followed by mollusks, and plants. However, the large number of plant and fish species on the surveillance species list means that overall predicted impact (from a taxonomic perspective) is greatest from these two groups. We recommend ways that the surveillance list could be applied to improve aquatic invasive species management efforts: engage in community-based surveillance, inform taxonomic and species surveillance priorities, provide guidance on monitoring protocols for surveillance, quantify the relative risk of various pathways of introduction and identify priority locations for surveillance based on this pathway assessment.},

Rivers flowing into Georgian Bay from the Canadian Shield are relatively low in conductivity compared to the main body of Lake Huron, and so there is an observed gradient of solutes near the river mouths. The field observations show a strong positive correlation between conductivity and calcium concentration. Thus, we use conductivity to infer the solute concentrations required for the successful growth of dreissenid mussels. We observe most mussels in regions where specific conductivities were greater than 140 mS/cm. We use field observations to examine how the low calcium river water mixes within the coastal zone, which sets solute gradients that determine mussel distribution. When river flows are low, there is only a weak solute gradient across the coastal zone, implying an intrusion of open bay waters into the shallow embayments that is favourable for the growth of mussels. In contrast, when river flows are as much as 10 times higher, there is a strong solute gradient that extends further towards the lake, and the low calcium appears to inhibit and limit the growth of dreissenid mussels. Thus, the seasonal character of solute gradients helps describe the spatial distribution of dreissenid mussels and helps explain the localized absence of a species that is otherwise prevalent in much of the Laurentian Great Lakes.},

We discuss marine conservation issues in the light of life cycle aspects and conclude that eDNA can improve our ecological knowledge in some instances, for example, in tracking migration patterns. We also illustrate and discuss the application of eDNA analysis within the context of population genetics, epigenetics, geochemistry and oceanography. Embedded into an interdisciplinary context, eDNA can be exploited by a huge variety of methodological techniques, and can resolve spatio-temporal patterns of diversity, species, or even populations within ecological, evolutionary, and management frameworks.},

	abstract = {Suspension feeders play pivotal roles in the nutrient cycling of almost all aquatic ecosystems. Since sufficiently large differences in the filter mesh size (FMS) can lead to different food web positions, the inter- and intraspecific variability of this trait might be of community-level importance. The aim of this study was to quantify the range of FMS variation within the three invasive Ponto-Caspian Chelicorophium species based on a large material representing various conditions (1,224 specimens from 40 samples across Central Europe), characterize the components of variation within populations, identify the main factors determining intraspecific differences, and reveal how intraspecific variation affects the FMS overlaps among species. The FMS of the most widespread invader, C. curvispinum, varied within the broadest range (between 2.34–8.28 μm, compared to 2.51–5.97 μm in C. robustum and 1.08–3.23 μm in C. sowinskyi); nevertheless, the contribution of intraspecific plasticity to the invasion success of the species is not evident based on the present study. The within-individual variability of FMS increased with the individual mean of the trait and decreased with body size; however, it showed little differences among samples. The among-individual variation within samples could be partitioned into components related to body size (ontogenetic niche shift/differences among cohorts) and sex (ecological sexual dimorphism) as well as a seemingly random component (individual specialization), varying widely in extent and relative contributions. The FMS of C. curvispinum was significantly larger in the presence of C. sowinskyi than in allopatry, likely reflecting character displacement; however, it did not show further increase when C. robustum was also present. Similar differences could not be observed in C. sowinskyi. The FMS ranges of C. curvispinum and C. robustum never overlapped with that of C. sowinskyi in co-occurrence despite the considerable intraspecific differences among sites, suggesting that their interaction can be seen as a clear case of niche differentiation by food particle size. On the contrary, the strong overlaps observed between C. curvispinum and C. robustum indicate that other factors might play the primary role in their coexistence. The studied species appear to be suitable model organisms for identifying the drivers and mechanisms of FMS variability.},

Combined with climate change, and other anthropogenic influences on environmental quality and ecosystem health, the true impacts of a particular species can be extremely difficult to determine for scientists, let alone laypersons.

Studies have also linked knowledge, past environmental activism, trust in governing agencies [5], value orientations, awareness [6], perceived effectiveness of policy, social capital [7] and perception of other actors’ actions [5, 7] with willingness to pay for environmental goods in the context of energy consumption, emission reductions, and waste management.

According to the cognitive hierarchy theory, human cognitions are organized hierarchically from values, which are centrally held and stable, to elements such as attitudes, beliefs, and ultimately behaviors, which are numerous and more easily changed [11, 12].},

However, some research has indicated that Zequanox may impact the body condition and survival of some non-target species. We assessed avoidance behaviors of two species of cold-, cool-, and warm-water fishes to Zequanox at the maximum concentration allowed by the USEPA label (100 mg/L as active ingredient). Naïve, juvenile fish (n = 30 per species) were individually observed in a two-flume choice tank through which Zequanox-treated and untreated water simultaneously flowed in an unobstructed arena. Individual fish were observed during an untreated control period (20 min) and two Zequanox-exposure periods (20 min each). Treatment was alternated between arena sides to account for potential side bias in the test subjects. Positional data were collected and tabulated in real time with EthoVision® XT software. Zequanox concentrations and water quality properties (pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and specific conductance) were monitored during each trial. Analysis of treatment response was performed using a contrast within linear mixed-effects models. Our results indicate that Brook Trout, Lake Trout, and Bluegill avoided Zequanox-treated water, Yellow Perch were indifferent to Zequanox-treated water, and Lake Sturgeon and Fathead Minnow were attracted to Zequanox-treated water. These results combined with existing species sensitivity literature may help inform resource managers of potential treatment-related risks.},

	abstract = {The New Zealand mud snail (NZMS) Potamopyrgus antipodarum, is an invasive species of freshwater snail that has become established in the United States. Where they establish, NZMSs can achieve very high densities and have negative ecological impacts. The discovery of NZMSs at Page Springs Hatchery (PSH) in 2019 triggered a need for treatment options in a hatchery that would not result in eradication of fish stocks. The effects of a low-dose (30 ppb) treatment of EarthTec® QZ on NZMSs, Page springsnails Pyrgulopsis morrisoni and pond snails Physella virgata were evaluated for 39 days. Pond snails fell to zero live individuals 15 days before NZMSs, which fell to zero live individuals 36 days into treatment. Page springsnails fell to zero live individuals three days after NZMSs. It appears that EarthTec® QZ may be an effective treatment for NZMSs under the conditions tested within PSH. Additional testing needs to be performed to evaluate the potential effects on other non-targets under varying environmental conditions.},

Life history theory suggests this allocation strategy may be favored by temporal pulses in the intensity of mortality and/or the capacity to produce new tissues.Addressing the origin of indeterminate growth and the variability of growth patterns, we studied the growth of duck mussels, Anodonta anatina, a pan‐European unionid, in 18 Polish lakes. For each population, the sex, size, and age of collected mussels were measured to estimate Bertalanffy's growth curve parameters. We integrated information on A. anatina mortality rates, lake trophy, biofouling by zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha, and the prevalence of parasitic trematode larvae to identify selective conditions in lakes.We found two sources of mortality in A. anatina populations, pertaining to adverse effects of zebra mussel biofouling and trophy state on mussel survival. Additionally, populations with heavier biofouling presented a smaller abundance of parasites, indicative of a relationship between filtering intensity and contraction of water‐borne trematode larvae by filtering A. anatina.Consistently for each sex, populations with a greater trophy‐related mortality were characterized in A. anatina by a smaller asymptotic size Lmax, indicative of a life history response to mortality risk involving early maturation at a smaller body size. In all populations, females featured higher mortality and larger asymptotic size versus males.Our findings support a theoretical view that adaptive responses to selection involve adjustments in the lifetime resource allocation patterns. These adjustments should be considered drivers of the origin of indeterminate growth strategy in species taking parental care by offspring brooding in body cavities.},

It is unassessed whether the aquarium trade spreads freshwater red macroalgae that hitchhike on ornamental aquatic plants and animals. We investigated this via a broad biodiversity survey and genetic analysis of freshwater red algae in the field and aquarium shops in East Asia. Using rbcL‐based DNA barcoding, we surveyed 125 samples from 46 field sites and 88 samples from 53 aquarium shops (213 samples in total) mostly across Taiwan—a key hub in the global aquarium trade—as well as in Hong Kong, Okinawa (Japan), the Philippines, and Thailand. We augmented our rbcL sequences with GenBank rbcL sequences that represent 40 additional countries globally. We found 26 molecular operational taxonomic units (mOTUs), some of which are cryptic, in Taiwan. Phylogeographical analysis revealed three potential introduced mOTUs, which exhibit no local genetic variation in Taiwan and are distributed across continents. Also, we posit that aquaria may serve as an unintentional ex situ conservation site for freshwater red algae that are vulnerable to water pollution due to anthropogenic disturbances. Collectively, these data suggest that freshwater red algae have been hitchhiking and dispersed via the aquarium trade, an important and overlooked mechanism of introduction of the organisms across the globe.},

This work synthesises invasive host-parasite interactions and impacts, using marine bivalves as a model group, to consider how global movement of shellfish consignments for aquaculture purposes facilitates the unintentional transfer of invasives. We discuss how invasive species can act as both hosts or parasitic organisms themselves, and introductions may lead to diseases within the bivalve aquaculture sector. This review highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research, with particular regard to the fields of parasitology and invasion ecology. We suggest that further integrating these fields will enhance critical knowledge of marine diseases, parasite-invasive-bivalve interplay dynamics, and potential mitigation strategies, including temperature-based disease surveillance models. We also address how climate change might impact invasive species, again with a focus on marine bivalves, and the potential outcomes for parasite transmission, including changes in host/parasite distribution, life-history and virulence. We acknowledge the importance of horizon scanning for future invasive host-parasite introductions and note that increased screening of invasive species, both in their native and invaded ranges, will provide clarity on invasion dynamics and potential impacts.},

	abstract = {The Asian house gecko (Hemidactylus frenatus)is one of the most widespread invasive species in the world; however, little is known about the factors that facilitated the success of this invasive gecko. Despite the tropical origin, the gecko has established populations in temperate regions of southeastern Australia. Therefore, I investigated thermal tolerance, thermal hardening, and thermal preference of the introduced geckos in New South Wales (NSW), in comparison with their native populations in Thailand. I found that house geckos from NSW could tolerate colder temperatures, responded to thermal stresses faster, and selected lower body temperatures than geckos from Thailand. The introduced geckos also showed an ability to acclimate seasonally and thermoregulate after feeding (post-feeding thermophily). These thermal adaptions would enable the geckos to survive and perform well in the cold climate of temperate regions, and conserve energy during the winter when food is limited.Previous studies suggested that successful invasive species have a suite of correlated behaviors that facilitate the invasion. However, since the benefits of each behavior could vary among situations, the ability to adjust behaviors should be necessary for invasive species. Therefore, I investigated the behaviors of the Asian house geckos from different populations to determine the effects of community composition on the expressions. For exploratory behavior, I found that the geckos from core communities tended to hide more and explore less. This behavioral type ensures their safety, as well as increases their chance of getting introduced. In contrast, the geckos from edge populations tended to hide less and explore more, so they should extend their range quickly. For agonistic behavior, I found that the geckos from a competitor-rich community were more aggressive than conspecifics from a competitor-released community. I suggest that the geckos adjust their behavior to balance the tradeoff between access to resources and energy consumption.My study has demonstrated the ability of the Asian house gecko to adjust both thermal biology and behavior in responding to different ecological contexts. Therefore, the gecko is likely to expand its range further, and cause problems beyond those predicted by static models. More screening of entry points, and community-based citizen science projects whereby people identify house geckos and their locations, may help to control and prevent future spread. Future studies of the molecular pathways underpinning shifts in thermal biology, along with studies of aggressive behaviors in other communities, would be useful for evaluating the generality of my results.},

This species was introducedinto Alberta waters in the early 2000s and its range has subsequently expanded. In 2018an established population of Prussian carp was discovered in Saskatchewan for the firsttime. In response to this discovery, I undertook the first study of this invasive fishspecies in Saskatchewan. I used a combination of field studies and citizen sciencereporting to conduct surveys for Prussian carp in Saskatchewan. I also used stableisotopes analysis of Prussian carp in Stockwell Lake to perform the first diet analysis forPrussian carp in North America. I used Carbon, Nitrogen, and Sulfur isotopes todetermine the diet composition based on prey items sampled. Prussian carp were foundthroughout the South Saskatchewan River system from the Alberta border to north ofSaskatoon. Citizen science reports were a much more effective way of surveying forPrussian carp than focused netting in specific areas. Bayesian mixing models showedthat Prussian carp diet in Stockwell lake consisted primarily of chironomids andzooplankton, and that diet composition shifted as Prussian carp increased in size. Largerfish used more benthic food resources (e.g., chironomids) than smaller ones. My workshows that Prussian carp are now well established in Saskatchewan and have thepotential to continue expanding their range into Manitoba and the United States. Dietanalyses confirmed that the Prussian carp is a generalist omnivore in Saskatchewan, andsuggests that this species may be very flexible in how it uses prey resources. Ultimately,the Prussian carp is an aquatic invasive species that has the potential to be verydamaging in Saskatchewan and will use provincial waterbodies as a conduit to colonizemore areas.},

AbstractInternational agreements commit nations to control or eradicate invasive alien species. The scale of this challenge exceeds available resources and so it is essential to prioritise the management of invasive alien species. Species prioritisation for management typically involves a hierarchy of processes that consider the likelihood and scale of impact (risk assessment) and the feasibility, costs and effectiveness of management (risk management). Risk assessment processes are widely used, risk management less so, but are a crucial component of resource decision making. To assess the cost-effectiveness of prioritisation, we considered 26 high-risk species considered for eradication from Great Britain (GB) with pre-existing risk assessment and risk management outputs. We extracted scores to reflect the overall risk to GB posed by the species, together with the estimated cost and the overall feasibility of eradication. We used these to consider the relative reduction in risk per unit cost when managing prioritised species based on different criteria. We showed that the cost-effectiveness of prioritisation within our sample using risk assessment scores alone, performed no better than a random ranking of the species. In contrast, prioritisation including management feasibility produced nearly two orders of magnitude improvement compared to random.

	abstract = {Simple SummaryGlobal climate change is responsible for more frequent heat waves, which offers opportunities for invasive species to expand their range. Two congener bivalves, the native Ruditapes decussatus and the invasive R. philippinarum, were exposed to a heat wave aquaria simulation and analysed for ecological and subcellular biomarkers responses. Despite reduced responses on the ecological level (bioturbation and nutrient concentration), there were differential responses to the heat wave at the subcellular level, where the invasive species seems to be less impacted than the native by the heat wave. This reinforces the common notion that climate change events may provide opportunities for biological invasions.AbstractGlobal warming and the subsequent increase in the frequency of temperature anomalies are expected to affect marine and estuarine species’ population dynamics, latitudinal distribution, and fitness, allowing non-native opportunistic species to invade and thrive in new geographical areas. Bivalves represent a significant percentage of the benthic biomass in marine ecosystems worldwide, often with commercial interest, while mediating fundamental ecological processes. To understand how these temperature anomalies contribute to the success (or not) of biological invasions, two closely related species, the native Ruditapes decussatus and the introduced R. philippinarum, were exposed to a simulated heat wave. Organisms of both species were exposed to mean summer temperature ({\textasciitilde}18 °C) for 6 days, followed by 6 days of simulated heat wave conditions ({\textasciitilde}22 °C). Both species were analysed for key ecological processes such as bioturbation and nutrient generation—which are significant proxies for benthic function and habitat quality—and subcellular biomarkers—oxidative stress and damage, and energetic metabolism. Results showed subcellular responses to heat waves. However, such responses were not expressed at the addressed ecological levels. The subcellular responses to the heat wave in the invasive R. philippinarum pinpoint less damage and higher cellular energy allocation to cope with thermal stress, which may further improve its fitness and thus invasiveness behaviour.},

Except in Oceania where the range decreased, an expansion of C. sowerbii was projected during the next century under modeled future scenarios being most intensive during the first half of the century. The present study shows that the expansion of C. sowerbii worldwide would be facilitated mainly by precipitation, vapor pressure, and temperature.

	abstract = {The present pilot study tested and validated the use of the ‘Invasive Alien Species in Europe’ smartphone app (IASapp) in the Lower Danube Region. The study was conducted in three stages: (1) Testing the effectiveness of the app in Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia by organizing information and field testing campaigns; (2) Improving and extending the functionality of the app and developing a list of the invasive alien species (IAS) of concern to the Danube River Basin (DRB); and (3) Testing the updated app during the Joint Danube Survey 4 campaign. Overall, 13 campaigns were carried out, during which seven aquatic IAS of EU concern and nine IAS relevant to the DRB were recorded. Currently, the developed new functionality of IASapp allows the recording of 64 IAS of DRB concern. The updated IASapp has an important role in increasing public awareness on IAS issues, as well as in enlarging the participation and output of citizen science in the IAS early detection, monitoring and reporting in the DRB. Therefore, the constant communication with existing stakeholder groups and establishment of new citizen science groups is crucial for increasing the effectiveness of using the IASapp in the Danube Region and tackling the IAS issues.},

	abstract = {Invasive consumers can cause extensive ecological damage to native communities but effects on ecosystem resilience are less understood. Here, we use drone surveys, manipulative experiments, and mathematical models to show how feral hogs reduce resilience in southeastern US salt marshes by dismantling an essential marsh cordgrass-ribbed mussel mutualism. Mussels usually double plant growth and enhance marsh resilience to extreme drought but, when hogs invade, switch from being essential for plant survival to a liability; hogs selectively forage in mussel-rich areas leading to a 50\% reduction in plant biomass and slower post-drought recovery rate. Hogs increase habitat fragmentation across landscapes by maintaining large, disturbed areas through trampling of cordgrass during targeted mussel consumption. Experiments and climate-disturbance recovery models show trampling alone slows marsh recovery by 3x while focused mussel predation creates marshes that may never recover from large-scale disturbances without hog eradication. Our work highlights that an invasive consumer can reshape ecosystems not just via competition and predation, but by disrupting key, positive species interactions that underlie resilience to climatic disturbances.Invasive species could have cascading effects on ecosystem functioning. Here the authors use experimental and remote sensing data and modelling to show that an invasive mammal causes loss of facilitative interactions between sessile ecosystem engineers in salt marshes, and lower ecosystem resilience to disturbance.},

However, with climate change, deforestation, and economic development, the diversity of Sapindus germplasms may face the risk of destruction. Therefore, utilising historical environmental data and future climate projections from the BCC-CSM2-MR global climate database, we simulated the current and future global distributions of suitable habitats for Sapindus using a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) model. The estimated ecological thresholds for critical environmental factors were: a minimum temperature of 0–20 °C in the coldest month, soil moisture levels of 40–140 mm, a mean temperature of 2–25 °C in the driest quarter, a mean temperature of 19–28 °C in the wettest quarter, and a soil pH of 5.6–7.6. The total suitable habitat area was 6059.97 × 104 km2, which was unevenly distributed across six continents. As greenhouse gas emissions increased over time, the area of suitable habitats contracted in lower latitudes and expanded in higher latitudes. Consequently, surveys and conservation should be prioritised in southern hemisphere areas which are in danger of becoming unsuitable. In contrast, other areas in northern and central America, China, and India can be used for conservation and large-scale cultivation in the future.},

Here, we describe an analysis of bacterial loads, community structure, and inferred metabolic pathways in the hemolymph of pheasantshells (Actinonaias pectorosa) from the Clinch River, USA, during a multi-year mass mortality event. Bacterial loads were approximately 2 logs higher in moribund mussels (cases) than in apparently healthy mussels (controls). Bacterial communities also differed between cases and controls, with fewer sequence variants (SVs) and higher relative abundances of the proteobacteria Yokenella regensburgei and Aeromonas salmonicida in cases than in controls. Inferred bacterial metabolic pathways demonstrated a predominance of degradation, utilization, and assimilation pathways in cases and a predominance of biosynthesis pathways in controls. Only two SVs correlated with Clinch densovirus 1, a virus previously shown to be strongly associated with mortality in this system: Deinococcota and Actinobacteriota, which were associated with densovirus-positive and densovirus-negative mussels, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that bacterial invasion and shifts in the bacterial microbiome during unionid mass mortality events may result from primary insults such as viral infection or environmental stressors. If so, bacterial communities in mussel hemolymph may be sensitive, if generalized, indicators of declining mussel health.},

	doi = {10.1186/s40317-021-00259-7},
	abstract = {Background 
Semi-aquatic mammals exploit resources both on land and in water and may require both to meet their habitat requirements including food- and building resources, refuges, and for social interactions with conspecifics. Within this, the specific availability of both terrestrial and aquatic resources is expected to impact individual fitness. Beavers are highly dependent on water for movement and protection from predators. They are central place foragers and mostly forage on woody vegetation near water although aquatic vegetation may also be an important food resource. However, little is known about their use of aquatic habitats. We aimed to address this knowledge gap by dead-reckoning fine-scale movement tracks and classifying fine-scale diving events, which we then related to the spatial distribution of aquatic vegetation and habitat components within the territory.
Results
Overall, there was a statistically clear decrease in probability that diving would occur at dawn and with increasing distance from territory borders. In addition, the distance from the lodge at which animals dived decreased through the night and during the spring/early summer. There was strong selection for diving habitats located closer to the riverbank, with stronger selection for these areas being observed in individuals with larger home ranges. We saw a higher selection for diving above clay sediment, and within 150 m from the lodge, presumably because mud and clay sediment tended to be located closer to the lodge than sand and rock sediment. Furthermore, we found a clear selection for diving in the presence of quillwort (Isoetes spp.), shoreweed (Littorella uniflora), and stonewort (Nitella spp.). Selection for these focal species was stronger among subordinate individuals. Individuals with lower body condition dived closer to the beaver lodge, and dives located further from the lodge were associated with high densities of aquatic vegetation.
Conclusion
We provide new knowledge on the aquatic habitat use in a semi-aquatic mammal and show how energetic constraints may shape how beavers spatially use the aquatic environment, whereby short and shallow dives appear most beneficial. We show how aquatic habitats may have great importance for both foraging, building materials and safety, and discuss to how they may affect the fitness of individuals.},

The species' invasion followed by the invasion's reversal occurred over only two decades and were documented by frequent monitoring of fish biomass and water quality. An initial moderate improvement in water quality was an environmental filter that enabled Prussian carp’s invasion but prevented the expansion of other species. A later substantial improvement stimulated native species’ colonization of the river, and made one rheophil, ide Leuciscus idus, a significant Prussian carp’s replacer. The redundancy analysis (RDA) of the dependence of changes in the biomass of fish species on water quality factors indicated that Prussian carp and ide responded in a significantly opposite way to changes in water quality in the river over the study period. However, the dependence of Prussian carp biomass on ide biomass, as indicated by regression analysis and analysis of species traits, suggests that the ecomorphological similarity of both species might have produced interference competition that contributed to Prussian carp’s decline.},

Recently recorded in the Greater North Sea ecoregion, an established population has not previously been confirmed. Combining historical and field data, we provided baseline information from the UK and recorded colonisation in a variety of habitats. Gonadal development was assessed using the gonadosomatic index (GSI) to determine if an intertidal soft-sediment population is self-sustaining. Arcuatula senhousia records from subtidal muddy/mixed-sediment within a major estuarine system from 2007 to 2016 were also analysed. First detected in 2011, spatial distribution was variable across the years within the subtidal, with individuals found at 4–9 out of 25 sites, and densities per site varying from 10 to 290 individuals per m2. The intertidal population was, in part, associated with seagrass (Zostera spp.) and attached to bivalves. In marinas, individuals were attached to concrete tiles, associated with live Mytilus edulis, and to dead Ostrea edulis. Mean GSI from the intertidal population differed across months, peaking in July before declining in September/October, but with high inter-individual variability. Arcuatula senhousia is reproducing and maintaining viable populations. Using a natural capital approach, we identify the potential impacts on Europe’s functionally important habitats, fisheries and aquaculture if its spread continues.},

	abstract = {The Laurentian Great Lakes comprise the largest assemblage of inland waterbodies in North America, with vast geographic, environmentally complex nearshore benthic substrate and associated habitat. The Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement, originally signed in 1972, aims to help restore and protect the basin, and ecosystem monitoring is a primary objective to support adaptive management, environmental policy, and decision making. Yet, monitoring ecosystem trends remains challenging, potentially hindering progress in lake management and restoration. Consistent, high-resolution maps of nearshore substrate and associated habitat are fundamental to support management needs, and the nexus of high-quality remotely sensed data with improvements to analytical methods are increasing opportunities for large-scale nearshore benthic mapping at project-relevant spatial resolutions. This study attempts to advance the integration of high-fidelity data (airborne imagery and lidar, satellite imagery, in situ observations, etc.) and machine learning to identify and classify nearshore benthic substrate and associated habitat using a case study in southwest Lake Michigan along Illinois Beach State Park, Illinois, USA. Data inputs and analytical methods were evaluated to better understand their implications with respect to the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS) classification hierarchy, resulting in an approach that could be easily applied to other shallow coastal environments. Classification of substrate and biotic components were iteratively classified in two Tiers in which classes with increasing specificity were identified using different combinations of airborne and satellite data inputs. Classification accuracy assessments revealed that for the Tier 1 substrate component (3 classes), average overall accuracy was 90.10 ± 0.60\% for 24 airborne data combinations and 89.77 ± 1.02\% for 12 satellite data combinations, whereas the Tier 1 biotic component (2 classes) average overall accuracy was 93.58 ± 0.91\% for 24 airborne data combinations and 92.67 ± 0.71\% for 11 satellite data combinations. The Tier 2 result for the substrate component (2 classes) was 93.28\% for 2 airborne data combinations and 95.25\% for the biotic component (2 classes). The study builds on foundational efforts to move towards a more integrated data approach, whereby data strengths and limitations for mapping nearshore benthic substrate and associated habitat, expressed through classification accuracy, were evaluated within the context of the CMECS classification hierarchy, and has direct applicability to critical monitoring needs in the Great Lakes.},

Generally speaking, the need for an approved BWTS is limited to large vessels, as they are too large or too expensive for small vessels to install. This study aims to propose a simple ballast-free approach for small vessels (e.g., tugs, workboats, research vessels) that require ballast to compensate for the weight loss of fuel when sailing. Our approach involves refitting the dedicated ballast tank of these small vessels to be drinking water tanks and filling the tanks with onboard-generated distilled or reverse osmosis water to adjust the stability of the ships. We assessed our approach using three vessels. Two ships using our proposed method were certified by the American Bureau of Shipping as containing no ballast water tank, and not being subject to the BWM Convention. This study provides an environmentally harmless, easy to use, and economical approach for small vessels to comply with the BWM Convention.},

This is because the quality of detection is strongly dependent on the quantity of viral particles, high spatio-temporal variabilities and the physico-chemical conditions of the water during sampling. To overcome these limitations, the present study aims to evaluate whether the bivalve mollusk Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) could be considered a suitable experimental model for assessing the viral contamination of rivers. In order to determine this, the capacity of D. polymorpha to accumulate FRNAPHs and assimilate them into their soft tissue was studied. This provided a proof of concept for the use of D. polymorpha to evaluate the viral contamination of surface water. Two experiments were conducted: (1) an in situ experiment to confirm that zebra mussels naturally accumulated FRNAPHs and (2) a laboratory experiment to determine the accumulation and depuration kinetics of FRNAPHs in D. polymorpha tissue. The study highlights the capacity of the mussels to accumulate infectious FRNAPHs both on a laboratory scale under controlled conditions as well as in situ at different sites that are representative of different bodies of water. An analysis of the mussels’ soft tissue showed that they were capable of reflecting the water’s contamination level very quickly (within less than 24 h). Moreover, the soft tissue retained the viral load much longer than the water due to a low depuration rate. The analysis of FRNAPH concentrations in mussels exposed in situ suggested that there were differences in contamination levels between sites. These preliminary results underline the potential utility of zebra mussels in assessing viral contamination by measuring the accumulation of FRNAPHs in their tissue. This may ultimately enable stakeholders to use zebra mussels as a means of monitoring viral pollution in surface water.},

Anthropogenic changes to rivers over the last few centuries led to the accelerating state of decline of coastal and estuarine regions globally. Urban rivers are parts of larger catchment ecosystems, which in turn form parts of wider nested, interconnected systems. Accurate modelling of urban rivers may not be possible because of the complex multisystem interactions operating concurrently and over different spatial and temporal scales. This paper overviews urban river syndrome, the accelerating deterioration of urban river ecology, and outlines growing conservation challenges of river restoration projects. This paper also reviews the river Thames, which is a typical urban river that suffers from growing anthropogenic effects and thus represents all urban rivers of similar type. A particular emphasis is made on ecosystem adaptation, widespread extinctions and the proliferation of non-native species in the urban Thames. This research emphasizes the need for a holistic systems approach to urban river restoration.},

This article further reviews past and current management, sampling and assessments trends and provides an objective overview of remediation, restoration and monitoring needs, practices and research gaps. Here, we argue that restoration work, if maladapted, can be ineffective in improving resilience or have unexpected side effects that make matters worse rather than better.

	abstract = {California’s vernal pools are important, declining, and intensely managed ecosystems. Recovery of vernal pool habitat relies on both monitoring and intervention. In order to meet recovery goals and maintain vernal pool habitat in the face of increasing urbanization, agricultural pressure and climate change, protected species must be actively managed. Genetics has up until now played only a minor role in the management of vernal pools species in California. Chapters one and two of this dissertation present novel resources to monitor a native vernal pool amphibian and four species of native branchiopod crustaceans using environmental DNA, and validates the resources in field and laboratory tests. The resources are highly accurate, easily deployable techniques that can detect the genetic material of a target from vernal pool water samples with at least 95\% accuracy using optimized sampling techniques. These resources can potentially complement or replace the dip-net monitoring methods currently used to track these species. Chapter three outlines a study using high-throughput Restriction-Enzyme-Associated Digest (RAD) sequencing to describe and compare the population genetics of five vernal pool branchiopod crustaceans across the California landscape. The work adds important knowledge about the variability and differentiation of these species to the library of vernal pool knowledge, which will pave the way for planned recovery efforts including re-introductions of protected species. Altogether, the dissertation adds genetic resources and knowledge to the vernal pool management toolkit as recovery efforts seek to maintain these ecosystems into the future.},

Recently recorded in the Greater North Sea ecoregion, an established population has not previously been confirmed. Combining historical and field data, we provided baseline information from the UK and recorded colonisation in a variety of habitats. Gonadal development was assessed using the gonadosomatic index (GSI) to determine if an intertidal soft-sediment population is self-sustaining. Arcuatula senhousia records from subtidal muddy/mixed-sediment within a major estuarine system from 2007 to 2016 were also analysed. First detected in 2011, spatial distribution was variable across the years within the subtidal, with individuals found at 4–9 out of 25 sites, and densities per site varying from 10 to 290 individuals per m2. The intertidal population was, in part, associated with seagrass (Zostera spp.) and attached to bivalves. In marinas, individuals were attached to concrete tiles, associated with live Mytilus edulis, and to dead Ostrea edulis. Mean GSI from the intertidal population differed across months, peaking in July before declining in September/October, but with high inter-individual variability. Arcuatula senhousia is reproducing and maintaining viable populations. Using a natural capital approach, we identify the potential impacts on Europe’s functionally important habitats, fisheries and aquaculture if its spread continues.},

However, accurate estimation of age and origin of eDNA is complicated by particle transport and the presence of legacy genetic material, which can obscure accurate interpretation of eDNA detection and quantification. To understand the state of genomic material within the environment, we investigated the degradation relationships between (a) size of fragments (long vs short), (b) genomic origins (mitochondrial vs nuclear), (c) nucleic acids (eDNA vs eRNA), and (d) RNA types (messenger (m)RNA vs ribosomal (r)RNA) from non-indigenous Dreissena mussels. Initial concentrations of eRNA followed expected transcriptional trends, with rRNAs found at {\textgreater} 1000 × that of eDNA, and a mitosis-associated mRNA falling below detection limits within 24 h. Furthermore, the ratio of eRNA:eDNA significantly decreased throughout degradation, potentially providing an estimate for the age of genomic material. Thus, eRNA quantification can increase detection due to the high concentrations of rRNAs. Furthermore, it may improve interpretation of positive detections through the eRNA:eDNA ratio and/or by detecting low abundant mitosis-associated mRNAs that degrade within {\textasciitilde} 24 h.},

	abstract = {Species introductions provide opportunities to quantify rates and patterns of evolutionary change in response to novel environments. Alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) are native to the East Coast of North America where they ascend coastal rivers to spawn in lakes and then return to the ocean. Some populations have become landlocked within the last 350 years and diverged phenotypically from their ancestral marine population. More recently, alewives were introduced to the Laurentian Great Lakes ({\textasciitilde}150 years ago), but these populations have not been compared to East Coast anadromous and landlocked populations. We quantified 95 years of evolution in foraging traits and overall body shape of Great Lakes alewives and compared patterns of phenotypic evolution of Great Lakes alewives to East Coast anadromous and landlocked populations. Our results suggest that gill raker spacing in Great Lakes alewives has evolved in a dynamic pattern that is consistent with responses to strong but intermittent eco-evolutionary feedbacks with zooplankton size. Following their initial colonization of Lakes Ontario and Michigan, dense alewife populations likely depleted large-bodied zooplankton, which drove a decrease in alewife gill raker spacing. However, the introduction of large, non-native zooplankton to the Great Lakes in later decades resulted in an increase in gill raker spacing, and present-day Great Lakes alewives have gill raker spacing patterns that are similar to the ancestral East Coast anadromous population. Conversely, contemporary Great Lakes alewife populations possess a gape width consistent with East Coast landlocked populations. Body shape showed remarkable parallel evolution with East Coast landlocked populations, likely due to a shared response to the loss of long-distance movement or migrations. Our results suggest the colonization of a new environment and cessation of migration can result in rapid parallel evolution in some traits, but contingency also plays a role, and a dynamic ecosystem can also yield novel trait combinations.},

	abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) can be used for early detection, population estimations, and assessment of potential spread of invasive species, but questions remain about factors that influence eDNA detection results. Efforts are being made to understand how physical, chemical, and biological factors—settling, resuspension, dispersion, eDNA stability/decay—influence eDNA estimations and potentially population abundance. In a series of field and controlled mesocosm experiments, we examined the detection and accumulation of eDNA in sediment and water and the transport of eDNA in a small stream in the Lake Michigan watershed, using the invasive round goby fish (Neogobius melanostomus) as a DNA source. Experiment 1: caged fish (average n = 44) were placed in a stream devoid of round goby; water was collected over 24 hours along 120-m of stream, including a simultaneous sampling event at 7 distances from DNA source; stream monitoring continued for 24 hours after fish were removed. Experiment 2: round goby were placed in laboratory tanks; water and sediment were collected over 14 days and for another 150 days post-fish removal to calculate eDNA shedding and decay rates for water and sediment. For samples from both experiments, DNA was extracted, and qPCR targeted a cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI) fragment specific to round goby. Results indicated that eDNA accumulated and decayed more slowly in sediment than water. In the stream, DNA shedding was markedly lower than calculated in the laboratory, but models indicate eDNA could potentially travel long distances (up to 50 km) under certain circumstances. Collectively, these findings show that the interactive effects of ambient conditions (e.g., eDNA stability and decay, hydrology, settling-resuspension) are important to consider when developing comprehensive models. Results of this study can help resource managers target representative sites downstream of potential invasion sites, thereby maximizing resource use.},

	abstract = {Species introductions provide opportunities to quantify rates and patterns of evolutionary change in response to novel environments. Alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) are native to the East Coast of North America where they ascend coastal rivers to spawn in lakes and then return to the ocean. Some populations have become landlocked within the last 350 years and diverged phenotypically from their ancestral marine population. More recently, alewives were introduced to the Laurentian Great Lakes ({\textasciitilde}150 years ago), but these populations have not been compared to East Coast anadromous and landlocked populations. We quantified 95 years of evolution in foraging traits and overall body shape of Great Lakes alewives and compared patterns of phenotypic evolution of Great Lakes alewives to East Coast anadromous and landlocked populations. Our results suggest that gill raker spacing in Great Lakes alewives has evolved in a dynamic pattern that is consistent with responses to strong but intermittent eco‐evolutionary feedbacks with zooplankton size. Following their initial colonization of Lakes Ontario and Michigan, dense alewife populations likely depleted large‐bodied zooplankton, which drove a decrease in alewife gill raker spacing. However, the introduction of large, non‐native zooplankton to the Great Lakes in later decades resulted in an increase in gill raker spacing, and present‐day Great Lakes alewives have gill raker spacing patterns that are similar to the ancestral East Coast anadromous population. Conversely, contemporary Great Lakes alewife populations possess a gape width consistent with East Coast landlocked populations. Body shape showed remarkable parallel evolution with East Coast landlocked populations, likely due to a shared response to the loss of long‐distance movement or migrations. Our results suggest the colonization of a new environment and cessation of migration can result in rapid parallel evolution in some traits, but contingency also plays a role, and a dynamic ecosystem can also yield novel trait combinations.},

Although the literature is quite rich about the impact of invasive species on plant and animal communities, their impact on environmental microbiomes is underexplored. Here, we re-analyze publicly available data using a common framework to create a global synthesis of the effects of biological invasions on environmental microbial communities. Our findings suggest that non-native species are responsible for the loss of microbial diversity and shifts in the structure of microbial populations. Therefore, the impact of biological invasions on native ecosystems might be more pervasive than previously thought, influencing both macro- and micro-biomes. We also identified gaps in the literature which encourage research on a wider variety of environments and invaders, and the influence of invaders across seasons and geographical ranges.},

	abstract = {The UN Convention on Biological Diversity has declared invasive species a global threat and requested increased data sharing to prevent further impact. Existing worldwide and local databases mainly focus on distribution, abundance, identification, and impacts of invasive species, but very few record management activities. In the Niagara region of Ontario, Canada, no database focuses specifically on invasive species management. The goal of this study was to document current aquatic and riparian invasive species management activities in the Niagara region and develop a database that would become a tool to facilitate collaboration at the regional level. The objectives were to (1) inventory current invasive species detection and control activities in the Niagara region; (2) examine perceived efficacy of control techniques; and (3) develop a database integrated with a GIS mapping component. Seventy-one organizations involved in riparian/aquatic invasive species management in the Niagara region were contacted and 16 in-depth interviews were conducted. In 2017–2018, 35 separate control efforts were reported, involving 10 riparian invasive species and two aquatic invasive species, mostly concentrated along the Niagara River. Collaboration efforts were minimal, occurring for only six specific projects. Recommendations include develop a regional invasive species plan; increase control efforts along the Welland Canal and Lake Erie shoreline; adopt a wider variety of control techniques; and increase collaboration, information-sharing and resource-sharing among organizations. Overall, the newly developed database provides a baseline for the current state of aquatic and riparian invasive species management activities in the region. It can also help bridge the gap between invasive species science and decision-making by forming a tool to identify resource-sharing opportunities, management efficacy, priority areas, areas of improvement, and future resource needs. The database will enrich the global invasive species information network by providing Niagara-specific information. The database could also act as a model for tracking management activities of other invasive species and in other regions of North America.},

	abstract = {BackgroundAquatic invasive species (AIS) threaten ecosystems and native species.MethodsTo determine spatial distributions of at-risk native taxa and AIS in two biologically diverse Laurentian Great Lakes tributaries, we extracted environmental DNA (eDNA) from water samples and used a universal PCR primer set targeting the CO1 gene for metabarcoding of selected taxa. We sampled 43 sites for eDNA in each of the Grand and Sydenham rivers in southwestern Ontario.ResultsWe assigned sequences to 49 taxa at the species level and four mollusks to genus level. Detected AIS included two oligochaete worms (Branchiura sowerbyi, Potamothrix moldaviensis), a freshwater jellyfish (Craspedacusta sowerbyi), a calanoid copepod (Skistodiaptomus pallidus), and a bivalve dreissenid mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). All but D. r. bugensis were previously unreported in these tributaries. Detected native mollusks included one globally endangered species the rayed bean (Villosa fabalis), one provincially listed threatened species the maple leaf mussel (Quadrula quadrula), and several other at-risk and unique mollusk species of special interest in Ontario, Canada, and the United States (e.g., Sphaerium fabale, Pyganodon grandis). At several sampling sites in each river, AIS eDNA overlapped with or was near to sites with detections of at-risk native mollusks. Most AIS and some native taxa demonstrated clustered detection patterns within each river. However, in some cases, independent detections of individual species occurred at individual sites within each river that were relatively far apart. Our findings should be interpreted with some caution due to the limitations of the aquatic “universal” primer set and the availability of comprehensive reference sequence databases.ConclusionResults from eDNA metabarcoding in our study helped reveal invertebrate AIS and at-risk species distributions and will help direct approaches for conserving biodiversity in each of these Great Lakes tributaries.},

[...]it is often not possible to set population threshold goals for suppression efforts that, once passed, decrease ecological impacts to the point where they are of low conservation concern (Green et al. ).

	abstract = {AimThe way in which habitat heterogeneity and predator density affect predator–prey dynamics, space use and prey risk are understudied aspects of foraging ecology, particularly for invasive species. Likewise, how an invasive species’ impact scales with its abundance is poorly understood. We used a model invasive species—lionfish (Pterois volitans)—to understand emergent multiple predator effects and influences of habitat heterogeneity on consumption rate and prey mortality risk.LocationFlorida, USA.MethodsWe considered effects of both predator and prey abundance on density‐dependent impact. We used functional response methodology to quantify the per‐capita effect of P. volitans, assessing concomitant influences of prey refuge (3 levels) and predator density (3 levels) on predator–prey space use and predation efficiency across increasing prey densities (7 levels). We then assessed intraspecific interaction outcomes by comparing observed per‐capita effects with predicted estimates based on consumption rates of individual predators. This allowed us to detect the presence of emergent multiple predator effects (MPEs) and tease apart density‐dependent impacts.ResultsLionfish predatory impact was mediated by predator and prey density but unaffected by refugia. Despite incongruent patch preferences between predators and their prey, predator impacts were context‐independent. We also detected nonlinear scaling of impact with increasing predator abundance. Pairs of lionfish had the greatest per‐capita effect, whose cumulative impact on prey matched that expected of independently foraging predators. At the highest predator density (four fish), antagonistic multiple predator effects precipitated prey risk reduction, in which we observed the lowest per‐capita effect. Across predator abundances, prey mortality rates were inversely density‐dependent.Main conclusionsQuantifying non‐independent consumptive effects of multiple conspecific predators across levels of prey abundance can inform better prediction and understanding of invasive species' density‐dependent effects. Additionally, consideration of heterogeneity‐mediated FRs and predator–prey spatial distributions may facilitate more precise and realistic predictions of invader impact across their invaded range.},

This is especially true for large river systems like the Colorado River that spans multiple states through mostly rural and agricultural land use. This study characterized the quantity and morphology of microplastics in different environmental compartments in two large reservoirs along the Colorado River: Lakes Mead and Mohave, within Lake Mead National Recreation Area. To assess microplastic occurrence, surface water and surficial sediment were sampled at a total of nine locations. Sampling locations targeted different sub-basins with varying levels of anthropogenic impact. Las Vegas Wash, a tributary which delivers treated wastewater to Lake Mead, was also sampled. A sediment core (33 cm long, representing approximately 19 years) was extracted from Las Vegas Bay to assess changes in microplastic deposition over time. Striped bass (Morone saxatilis), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), quagga mussels (Dreissena bugensis), and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) were sampled at a subset of locations to assess biological uptake of microplastics. Microplastic concentrations were 0.44–9.7 particles/cubic meter at the water surface and 87.5–1,010 particles/kilogram dry weight (kg dw) at the sediment surface. Sediment core concentrations were 220–2,040 particles/kg dw, with no clear increasing or decreasing trend over time. Shellfish microplastic concentrations ranged from 2.7–105 particles/organism, and fish concentrations ranged from 0–19 particles/organism. Fibers were the most abundant particle type found in all sample types. Although sample numbers are small, microplastic concentrations appear to be higher in areas of greater anthropogenic impact. Results from this study improve our understanding of the occurrence and biological uptake of microplastics in Lake Mead National Recreation Area, and help fill existing knowledge gaps on microplastics in freshwater environments in the southwestern U.S.},

	abstract = {With the global-scale loss of biodiversity, current restoration programs have been often required as part of conservation plans for species richness and ecosystem integrity. The restoration of pelagic-oriented cisco (Coregonus artedi) has been an interest of Lake Michigan managers because it may increase the diversity and resilience of the fish assemblages and conserve the integrity of the ecosystems in a changing environment. To inform restoration, we described historical habitat use of cisco by analyzing a unique fishery-independent dataset collected in 1930–1932 by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries’ first research vessel Fulmar and a commercial catch dataset reported by the State of Michigan in the same period, both based on gear fished on the bottom. Our results confirmed that the two major embayments, Green Bay and Grand Traverse Bay, were important habitats for cisco and suggest that the Bays were capable of supporting cisco to complete its entire life cycle in the early 20th century as there was no lack of summer feeding and fall spawning habitats. Seasonally, our results showed that cisco stayed in nearshore waters in spring, migrated to offshore waters in summer, and then migrated back to nearshore waters in fall. The results also suggest that in summer, most ciscoes were in waters with bottom depths of 20–70 m, but the highest cisco density occurred in waters with a bottom depth around 40 m. We highlight the importance of embayment habitats to cisco restoration and the seasonal migration pattern of cisco identified in this study, which suggests that a restored cisco population can diversify the food web by occupying different habitats from the exotic fishes that now dominate the pelagic waters of Lake Michigan.},

	abstract = {Humans have created an accelerating, increasingly connected, globalized economy, resulting in a more globalized, shared flora. The prevention of new, establishing species is less costly, both economically and ecologically, and is more manageable than eradicating nonnative invasive species once they are widespread and negatively impactful. We ask if international trade hubs and points-of-entry with high-volume trade, constant disturbance, and propagule rain have a higher number of nonnative species compared to surrounding areas and if they may serve as initial establishment sites and refugia of nonnative, invasive populations. Therefore, we partnered with various federal, state, and private interests to evaluate the floristic composition at the Garden City Terminal of the Port of Savannah, Georgia, USA. We conducted the following study to demonstrate the collaborative relationship-building between researchers and industry and to develop a framework for biodiversity conservation. In our study, we collected all reproductive vascular plants in the secured areas of the Garden City Terminal during four major seasonal time points over two years. The percent of nonnative species and number of nonnative plant species per hectare at this industrial location exceeded all other comparison floras. The mean coefficient of conservatism was lowest among the comparison floras, indicating a highly disturbed habitat with nonnative, weedy native, and other native species tolerant of disturbance. Our study represents one of the first inventories of an Industrialized Flora and indicates that such areas are hot-spots of nonnative plant diversity and possible sources of emergent plant invasions. We posit that industrial sites and international points-of-entry should be considered laboratories for research on species transport and introduction, adaptability, and taxonomic delineation to better understand the mechanisms and consequences of biotic homogenization due to the volume and frequency of anthropogenic activities.},

	abstract = {Invasive and medically important arthropods continue to spread and establish worldwide whilst adversely impacting ecosystems and public health. As the eradication and population suppression of these invaders and pests can be highly problematic and frequently unsuccessful, prevention of their further spread and establishment is imperative. Currently, however, there remains a lack of efficacious and cost-effective spread prevention techniques; particularly for species with complex life histories that span both aquatic and terrestrial habitats, such as mosquitoes. Here, we examine the use of steam exposure and disinfectant (Virkon® Aquatic) treatments to cause mortality of juvenile life stages of two invasive disease vector mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus and Culex quinquefasciatus. Steam treatments induced total mortality of A. albopictus and C. quinquefasciatus egg stages, following thirty second and five second exposures, respectively. Hatchability of A. albopictus eggs was substantially reduced following ten seconds of steam exposure. Total A. albopictus larval mortality was caused by steam exposures of one second or longer. Conversely, the aquatic disinfectant failed to impede hatchability of A. albopictus or C. quinquefasciatus egg stages. However, disinfection with Virkon® Aquatic caused up to total mortality of mosquito larvae at exposure durations exceeding one minute at 4\% concentrations, and five minutes at 1\% concentrations. Our results suggest that steam treatments could be implemented as a biosecurity technique to prevent spread and establishment of invasive mosquitoes. Whilst the efficacy of chemical disinfections to cause mortality was not apparent towards mosquito eggs, applications could achieve significant mortality towards larvae in aquatic environments.},

	abstract = {The Rocky Mountain ridged mussel (Gonidea angulata) is a bivalve species whose Canadian range is limited to the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia. In 2019, conflicts between habitat protection for the mussel and potential habitat alteration to control the invasive Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) (milfoil), led to a decision to maintain the status of the mussels as Special Concern under Canada’s Species at Risk Act (SARA) rather than classify it as Endangered. Milfoil control can cause direct mortality and/or burial of the mussels, but there had been no systematic study of the impacts of milfoil control on mussel beds. The purpose of this study was to address knowledge gaps by delineating known mussel beds and potential overlap with milfoil to provide information for management decisions that balance the needs of native species protection and invasive species control. Rocky Mountain ridged mussels in three reference locations were enumerated using snorkel surveys. The presence and distribution of milfoil was documented in relation to five sites within these three locations. Milfoil was encroaching on one site, causing some changes to the substrate. At other sites, the differences in the depth and distribution of the mussel and the milfoil could allow milfoil control without damaging the mussel beds. It is recommended that, before milfoil removal near known mussel beds be undertaken, a detailed site evaluation be conducted to determine potential impacts. This study suggests presumed impediments to co-managing the mussels and controlling an invasive species should not preclude classifying the mussels as Endangered and affording protections under SARA .},

The mixtures consisted of 12.5 µg/L of each nanoparticle (Mix50) and 50 µg/L of each nanoparticles (Mix200). After a 96-h exposure period, mussels were analyzed for morphological changes, air time survival, bioaccumulation, inflammation (cyclooxygenase or COX activity), lipid peroxidation (LPO), DNA strand breaks, labile Zn, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and protein–ubiquitin levels. The data revealed that mussels accumulated the nanoparticles with nCeO and nAg were the least and most bioavailable, respectively. Increased tissue metal loadings were observed for nCeO and nCuO in mixtures, while no mixture effects were observed for nAg and nZnO. The weight loss during air emersion was lower in mussels exposed to nCuO alone but not by the mixture. On the one hand, labile Zn levels was increased with nZnO but returned to control values with the Mix50 and Mix200, suggesting antagonism. On the other hand, DNA strand breaks were reduced for both mixtures compared to controls or to the nanoparticles individually, suggesting potentiation of effects. The same was found for protein–ubiquitin levels, which were decreased by nCeO and nCuO alone but not when in mixtures, which increased their levels. In conclusion, the data revealed that the behavior and effects of nanoparticles were influenced by other nanoparticles where antagonist and potentiation interactions were identified.},

	abstract = {Invasive exotic plants can cause significant ecological changes that span large spatial and temporal scales. Invasive exotic plants have been increasing in number and extent in Rocky Mountain National Park and such proliferation is a primary resource management concern. Two of the most important factors regulating invasive exotic plant establishment and spread are resource availability and propagule pressure. Natural disturbances can cause changes to available resources which create opportunities for invasive exotic plant colonization and proliferation. Outdoor recreation can enhance propagule pressure by transporting and depositing invasive exotic plant seeds along trails. This study examines the effects of enhanced propagule pressure from recreation in areas affected by two important disturbances in the Rocky Mountain region, bark beetle outbreaks and fire. Native plant community, invasive exotic plant abundance, tree mortality, and disturbance agent were measured in 227 plots along thirteen trails in Rocky Mountain National Park. Linear models were used to determine the effects of vegetation type, bark beetle mortality, burning, and visitation on invasive exotic plant abundance. Overall, vegetation type was an important factor controlling IEP abundance (adjusted R2 = .7227, p {\textless} .0001) which modulated the effects of visitation and disturbance. Visitation (adjusted R2 = 0.6841, p {\textless} .0001) and tree mortality (adjusted R2 = 0.7926, p {\textless} .0001) from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) had significant effects on invasive exotic plant abundance in lodgepole pine stands. Linear models which include both explanatory factors were best fit to IEP abundance (Akaike weight = 1, adjusted R2 = .8645), indicating coregulation between these two invasion components. This study also shows that fire has severe and long-lasting effects on IEP abundance (Adjusted R2 = .7663, p {\textless} .0001). Lastly, this study examined which variables are most important for IEPs to proliferate beyond foothold populations which result from direct trail effects. Disturbance was found to create important pathways for IEPs to proliferate beyond the trail periphery and into backcountry areas (fire: adjusted R2 = .692, p {\textless} .0001; bark beetle: adjusted R2 = .5966, p {\textless} .0001). This study provides novel evidence that mortality from mountain pine beetle can support IEP establishment and spread. Additionally, findings are interpreted to demonstrate coregulation between resource availability and propagule pressure and important pathways for IEP spread. Finally, the findings of this study are considered through a management lens and placed within an invasion framework that acknowledges the interplay between vegetation type, propagule pressure, and resource availability. Incorporating these variables into a single, hierarchal framework provides direction for IEP prediction, monitoring, and management in backcountry areas of Rocky Mountain National Park.},

	abstract = {The degradation of wetland ecosystems is currently recognized as one of the main threats to global biodiversity. As a means of compensation, constructed wetlands (CWs), which are built to treat agricultural runoff and municipal wastewater, have become important for maintaining biodiversity. Here, we review studies on the relationships between CWs and their associated biodiversity published over the past three decades. In doing so, we provide an overview of how wildlife utilizes CWs, and the effects of biodiversity on pollutant transformation and removal. Beyond their primary aim (to purify various kinds of wastewater), CWs provide sub-optimal habitat for many species and, in turn, their purification function can be strongly influenced by the biodiversity that they support. However, there are some difficulties when using CWs to conserve biodiversity because some key characteristics of these engineered ecosystems vary from natural wetlands, including some fundamental ecological processes. Without proper management intervention, these features of CWs can promote biological invasion, as well as form an ‘ecological trap’ for native species. Management options, such as basin-wide integrative management and building in more natural wetland components, can partially offset these adverse impacts. Overall, the awareness of managers and the public regarding the potential value of CWs in biodiversity conservation remains superficial. More in-depth research, especially on how to balance different stakeholder values between wastewater managers and conservationists, is now required.},

However, many reefs have been lost or severely degraded through anthropogenic effects like dredging, channelization, or sedimentation. Constructed reefs have been used to mitigate these effects in some systems, but these reefs are also subject to degradation which may warrant custodial maintenance. Monitoring and maintenance of natural or constructed spawning reefs are not common practices; therefore, few methodologies have been created to test the effectiveness of such tools. We conducted a literature review to assess available information on maintenance of rocky spawning habitats used by lithophilic fishes. We identified 54 rocky spawning habitat maintenance projects, most of which aimed to improve fish spawning habitats through the addition of spawning substrate (n = 33) or cleaning of substrate (n = 23). In comparison to shallow riverine studies focused on salmonids, we found little information on deep-water reefs, marine reefs, or other fish species. We discuss the possible application of potential spawning habitat cleaning methods from other disciplines (e.g., treasure hunting; archeology) that may provide effective means of reef maintenance that can be used by restoration practitioners.},

	abstract = {Preventing the interbasin transfer of aquatic invasive species is a high priority for natural resource managers. Such transfers can be made by humans or can occur by dispersal through connected waterways. A natural surface water connection between the Atlantic and Pacific drainages in North America exists at Two Ocean Pass south of Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii bouvieri used this route to cross the Continental Divide and colonize the Yellowstone River from ancestral sources in the Snake River following glacial recession 14,000 bp. Nonnative lake trout Salvelinus namaycush were stocked into lakes in the Snake River headwaters in 1890 and quickly dispersed downstream. Lake trout were discovered in Yellowstone Lake in 1994 and were assumed to have been illegally introduced. Recently, lake trout have demonstrated their ability to move widely through river systems and invade headwater lakes in Glacier National Park. Our objective was to determine if lake trout and other nonnative fish were present in the connected waters near Two Ocean Pass and could thereby colonize the Yellowstone River basin in the past or future. We used environmental DNA (eDNA), electrofishing, and angling to survey for lake trout and other fishes. Yellowstone cutthroat trout were detected at nearly all sites on both sides of the Continental Divide. Lake trout and invasive brook trout S. fontinalis were detected in Pacific Creek near its confluence with the Snake River. We conclude that invasive movements by lake trout from the Snake River over Two Ocean Pass may have resulted in their colonization of Yellowstone Lake. Moreover, Yellowstone Lake may be vulnerable to additional invasions because several other nonnative fish inhabit the upper Snake River. In the future, eDNA collected across smaller spatial intervals in Pacific Creek during flow conditions more conducive to lake trout movement may provide further insight into the extent of non-native fish invasions in this stream.},

	abstract = {The Colorado River basin (CRB), the primary water source for southwestern North America, is divided into the 283,384 km2, water-exporting Upper CRB (UCRB) in the Colorado Plateau geologic province, and the 344,440 km2, water-receiving Lower CRB (LCRB) in the Basin and Range geologic province. Long-regarded as a snowmelt-fed river system, approximately half of the river’s baseflow is derived from groundwater, much of it through springs. CRB springs are important for biota, culture, and the economy, but are highly threatened by a wide array of anthropogenic factors. We used existing literature, available databases, and field data to synthesize information on the distribution, ecohydrology, biodiversity, status, and potential socio-economic impacts of 20,872 reported CRB springs in relation to permanent stream distribution, human population growth, and climate change. CRB springs are patchily distributed, with highest density in montane and cliff-dominated landscapes. Mapping data quality is highly variable and many springs remain undocumented. Most CRB springs-influenced habitats are small, with a highly variable mean area of 2200 m2, generating an estimated total springs habitat area of 45.4 km2 (0.007\% of the total CRB land area). Median discharge also is generally low and variable (0.10 L/s, N = 1687, 95\% CI = 0.04 L/s), but ranges up to 1800 L/s. Water pH and conductivity is negatively related to elevation, with a stronger negative relationship in the UCRB compared to the LCRB. Natural springs water temperature and geochemistry throughout the CRB varies greatly among springs, but relatively little within springs, and depends on aquifer hydrogeology, elevation, and residence time. As the only state nearly entirely included within the CRB, Arizona is about equally divided between the two geologic provinces. Arizona springs produce approximately 0.6 km3/year of water. Data on {\textgreater}330 CRB springs-dependent taxa (SDT) revealed at least 62 plant species; 216 aquatic and riparian Mollusca, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, and other invertebrate taxa; several herpetofanual species; and two-thirds of 35 CRB fish taxa. Springs vegetation structure, composition, and diversity vary strongly by springs type, and plant species density within springs is high in comparison with upland habitats. Plant species richness and density is negatively related to elevation below 2500 m. Human population in and adjacent to the CRB are growing rapidly, and ecological impairment of springs exceeds 70\% in many landscapes, particularly in urbanized and rangeland areas. Anthropogenic stressors are primarily related to groundwater depletion and pollution, livestock management, flow abstraction, non-native species introduction, and recreation. Ensuring the ecological integrity and sustainability of CRB groundwater supplies and springs will require more thorough basic inventory, assessment, research, information management, and local ecosystem rehabilitation, as well as improved groundwater and springs conservation policy.},

	abstract = {Biological responses of zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha are investigated to assess the impact of contaminants on aquatic organisms and ecosystems. In addition to concentrate chemical contaminants in their tissues, zebra mussels accumulate several microorganisms such as viruses, protozoa and bacteria. In order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the defence against microorganisms this study aims at identifying immune proteins from D. polymorpha hemolymph involved in defence against protozoa and viruses. For this purpose, hemolymph were exposed ex vivo to Cryptosporidium parvum and RNA poly I:C. Differential proteomics on both hemocytes and plasma revealed immune proteins modulated under exposures. Different patterns of response were observed after C. parvum and RNA poly I:C exposures. The number of modulated proteins per hemolymphatic compartments suggest that C. parvum is managed in cells while RNA poly I:C is managed in plasma after 4 h exposure. BLAST annotation and GO terms enrichment analysis revealed further characteristics of immune mechanisms. Results showed that many proteins involved in the recognition and destruction of microorganisms were modulated in both exposure conditions, while proteins related to phagocytosis and apoptosis were exclusively modulated by C. parvum. This differential proteomic analysis highlights in zebra mussels modulated proteins involved in the response to microorganisms, which reflect a broad range of immune mechanisms such as recognition, internalization and destruction of microorganisms. This study paves the way for the identification of new markers of immune processes that can be used to assess the impact of both chemical and biological contaminations on the health status of aquatic organisms.},

However, the effectiveness of various biosecurity treatments requires further exploration. Killer shrimp, Dikerogammarus villosus, a notoriously high impact and ecosystem destabilising invader, has rapidly spread across Europe, and is of concern to invade Northern America. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of three commonly used, broad-spectrum disinfectants to cause mortality of D. villosus: Virasure Aquatic, Virkon Aquatic, and Virkon S. Immersion and spray treatments of 1\%, 2\% and 4\% disinfectant solutions were examined for applications of up to 300 secs immersion and for up to ten consecutive sprays. Furthermore, we assessed the effectiveness of steam (≥100 °C) treatments for up to 120 secs. For all disinfectants, immersion in 1\% solutions caused 100\% mortality at ≥120 secs. At higher concentrations, shorter immersion times caused complete mortality: 60 and 15 secs for 2\% and 4\% solutions, respectively. Five sprays of 2\% and 4\% solutions resulted in 100\% mortality, for all disinfectants. Direct steam exposure was highly effective, with complete D. villosus mortality occurring at ≥10 secs. Overall, brief exposure to broad-spectrum disinfectants and direct steam could be used to limit D. villosus spread.},

Next-generation sequencing technologies are applied to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the invasion. The ecological immunology focuses on the role of immunity in invasion, and its magnitude could help to predict the invasiveness of alien species. A remarkable case of invasion has been reported in the Ría de Vigo (Spain) by the black pygmy mussel Xenostrobus securis. In Galicia, the Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is the predominant cultured bivalve species. Can we predict the invasiveness of alien bivalve species by analyzing their immune response? Can X. securis represent a risk for the autochthonous mussel? We evaluated the suitability of the immune-related hypotheses in our model by using an integrated transcriptomic and functional immunological approach. Our analysis suggests lower immune capabilities in X. securis compared to M. galloprovincialis, probably due to the relocation of energetic resources from the immune response to vital physiological processes to cope with salinity stress. This multidisciplinary approach will help us understand how the immune response can be influenced by the adaptive process and how this immune response can influence the invasion process.},

	abstract = {Eradication and suppression strategies for established populations of invasive species require innovative but readily available techniques, which maximise efficacy whilst minimising environmental damage. The Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774), is a high impact freshwater invader that can dominate macroinvertebrate communities and physically alter benthic habitats. Globally, despite efforts to implement substantial population control measures, C. fluminea continues to invade, spread and persist within freshwater environments. Accordingly, improved eradication, population suppression and rapid reaction techniques are urgently required. As C. fluminea beds can often become exposed during low water conditions, the present study examines the efficacy of an open-flame heat torch, generating {\textasciitilde} 1000 °C, in killing exposed individuals. Direct and indirect applications of the open-flame torch were examined, for C. fluminea residing on top of or within the substrate, respectively. Experiments revealed that ≥ 3 seconds of direct exposure to the flame causes complete mortality of C. fluminea, while only low mortality rates of between 8–11\% were achieved for mud-dwelling C. fluminea following 30 seconds of indirect exposure. However, a longer exposure time of 5 minutes can cause complete mortality of buried C. fluminea. Further, combined rake and burn treatments, where the substrate is disturbed between one minute flame applications, can completely kill all C. fluminea specimens residing within beds, following multiple applications. Overall, these results demonstrate that the application of open-flame heat torch treatments can be used for effective, rapid response and substantial population control of C. fluminea populations residing upon naturally and anthropogenically exposed river, lake and canal beds. Although promising, our laboratory results require up-scaling to field application, including examination of other substrate types, increased substrate depth, and greater bed densities of C. fluminea.},

	abstract = {Ballast water is a leading vector for the introduction of aquatic invasive species worldwide and, once a novel species is established, regional ballast water exchange between ports can accelerate secondary spread. The importance of shipping induced invasions in the Laurentian Great Lakes has resulted in policies that require more stringent ballast water treatment standards for trans-oceanic shipping than is required of ships operating regionally within the Great Lakes. As a result, ballast water discharges within the Great Lakes are not well regulated, primarily because of the challenge of treating the high volumes of water carried by vessels that are confined to the waters of the Great Lakes. We used a discrete-time Markov chain model on a network with annual time-steps to simulate ballast water management scenarios at high-priority ports in the Great Lakes shipping network for two potential invaders, golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei) and monkey goby (Neogobius fluviatilis). We chose high-priority ports by using graph-theoretic network analysis techniques to calculate six network centrality metrics for 151 ports in the network. Ports scoring high in network centrality scores have more ties with other ports or are positioned within the network such that they potentially have greater influence over the secondary spread of aquatic invasive species than other ports. We simulated secondary spread scenarios where hypothetical ballast water treatment was implemented at the top twenty ranked ports in each network centrality metric, as well as the top twenty busiest ports by ship arrivals. The results of each scenario were compared to a scenario where no management action was taken. Simulated secondary spread for both golden mussel and monkey goby resulted in significantly reduced infestation probabilities (p {\textless} 0.001) under all management scenarios when compared to unmanaged spread scenarios. Management at ports with inwardly directed ties to other ports reduced infestations by the greatest amount compared to other management scenarios; 65.4\% for golden mussel and 74.6\% for monkey goby. The indegree centrality of ports in the Great Lakes was found to be an important factor in governing secondary spread. Here we show that prioritized management, like high volume shore based treatment systems based on network centrality, is a potentially effective strategy for impeding the secondary spread of new or localized invasive species in the Great Lakes.},

Most amphibian populations are threatened by numerous ecological and anthropogenic variables acting in synergy with climate change. Accumulating basic ecological data such as range enables the development of population and range dynamics, themselves resulting on adequate conservation plans. Karsenia koreana is the only known Asian plethodontic salamander, occurring in a very restricted area only. Based on presence data, we created an ecological model using six bioclimatic factors with low multicollinearity to define the adequate habitat of the species, and we modelled the predicted suitability of the Korean landscape following four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) predicting climate change scenarios based on CO2 concentrations in 2050 and 2070. The maximum entropy model for the current distribution produced a landscape suitability considerably wider than the current known distribution. The projected ranges for each RCP indicated marked increases, decreases and shifts in areas with suitable landscapes due to climate change. The lowest RCP prediction resulted in an increase in suitable area, although potentially without connectivity with current populations, while the highest RCP predictions resulted in a decrease. Our results highlight the potential negative impact of climate change, thus requiring updates in conservation plans for K. koreana. The methods used here can be replicated with any land-dwelling species, and our results reflect expected range shifts for most amphibians of the northern hemisphere.},

Each chapter is written by one or more authors who is an authority on that particular system. Summaries of research on the various islands are written in a narrative manner that includes science as well as personal insights in easily understood language. These varied vignettes of science feature islands around the world, and in all cases, fantastic species of snakes and their roles in the community of insular organisms in which they occur. Both challenges and opportunities associated with island life are discussed, as well as the unique attributes of snakes and their conservation as unique and important parts of nature. Chapters include colorful photographs and illustrations, and collectively they convey information on topics that include ecology, behavior, biogeography, physiology, adaptation, and evolutionary biology. An introductory chapter presents a review and perspective on the historical importance of island ecology and how snakes have contributed to our understanding of evolution and adaptation. The other chapters focus on snakes inhabiting islands associated with Asia, Australia, South America, North America, the Caribbean, and Europe. The final chapter features the unique "table top islands" or tepuis of South America as examples of ecological islands where elements of biota have become isolated by geographic features of landscape similarly to oceanic islands.},

	abstract = {The accumulation of aquatic organisms on the wetted surfaces of vessels (i.e., vessel biofouling) negatively impacts world-wide shipping through reductions in vessel performance and fuel efficiency, and increases in emissions. Vessel biofouling is also a potent mechanism for the introduction and spread of marine non-indigenous species. Guidance and regulations from the International Maritime Organization, New Zealand, and California have recently been adopted to address biosecurity risks, primarily through preventive management. However, appropriate reactive management measures may be necessary for some vessels. Vessel in-water cleaning or treatment (VICT) has been identified as an important tool to improve operating efficiency and to reduce biosecurity risks. VICT can be applied proactively (i.e., to prevent the occurrence of, or to remove, microfouling (i.e., slime) or prevent the occurrence of macrofouling organisms - large, distinct multicellular organisms visible to the human eye), or reactively (i.e., to remove macrofouling organisms). However, unmanaged VICT includes its own set of biosecurity and water quality risks. Regulatory policies and technical advice from California and New Zealand have been developed to manage these risks, but there are still knowledge gaps related to the efficacy of available technologies. Research efforts are underway to address these gaps in order to inform the regulatory and non-regulatory application of VICT.},

	abstract = {Most hydrotechnical buildings under construction demand the concrete mixture to be set directly under water. The main reason for such a procedure is to limit the washing away of the the concrete binding mixture and to increase the efficiency of organisation of work so as to ensure continuity in concreting. The impact on the aquatic environment of recent developments in concrete technology and the use of new components has not yet been established. Natural pebble aggregate containing portland cement and fugacious siliceous ash as a binder was used to prepare BP concrete samples, while concrete marked LB was composed with lightweight aggregate and portland cement as a binder. The aim of this paper was to answer to the question whether hydrotechnical concrete of different compositions (BP and LB) and the technology of setting in a water habitat have any influence on the life condition of commonly occurring Dreissena polymorpha (Mollusca, Bivalvia). The lethal effect of two types of freshly hardening concrete was observed. In the case of LB concrete the lethal outcome for D. polymorpha could be the effect of a considerable increase of electrolytic conduction in the test cultivation. In the case of BP the parameters of electrolytic conductivity and pH did not exceed the values appearing in lakes. The possibility of the occurrence of toxic compounds of D. polymorpha, arising from the reaction of the aquatic / lake environment or the elution of some components should be taken into account. D. polymorpha serves as an indicator of toxicity in the aquatic environment and therefore can be used as a model organism in the analysis of the influence concrete on the natural environment. The results obtained in this study indicate the significant impact of modern chemical composition of concrete on the aquatic environment and the living organisms that cover it. They underline the need for research based on the hydrobiont reaction to the substances used in the natural environment.},

This study is a proof of concept for harnessing Synthetic Ecology in expanding the scale of commercially relevant micro algae (Chlorella vulgaris) cultivation using stable Synthetic Ecologies in open environments as opposed to vulnerable monocultures. We focused on whether the grazing activity of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) would result in a consistent, and commercially favourable, dominance of Chlorella in cultures that were also inoculated with a competing and potentially invasive cyanobacteria (Synechocystis sp. PCC6803). The key result of this study was that in axenic mixed species co-cultures, zebra mussels had a significantly greater negative effect on Synechocystis cell numbers than Chlorella (P {\textless} 0.0001). The zebra mussels’ putative preference for Synechocystis over Chlorella suggests they could be used to maintain the dominance of Chlorella in outdoor cultivation systems prone to contamination by invasive cyanobacteria.},

	abstract = {Freshwater ecosystems rank among the most endangered ecosystems in the world and are under increasing threat from aquatic invasive species (AIS). Understanding the range expansion of AIS is key for mitigating their impacts. Most approaches rely on Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to predict the expansion of AIS, using mainly environmental variables, yet ignore the role of human activities in favouring the introduction and range expansion of AIS. In this study, we use five SDM algorithms (independently and in ensemble) and two accuracy measures (TSS, AUC), combined with a null modelling approach, to assess the predictive performance of the models and to quantify which predictors (environmental and anthropogenic from the native and introduced regions) best explain the distribution of nine freshwater invasive species (including fish, arthropods, molluscs, amphibians and reptiles) in a large island (Great Britain), and which species characteristics affect model performance. Our results show that the distribution of invasive species is difficult to predict by SDMs, even in cases when TSS and AUC model accuracy values are high. Our study strongly advocates the use of null models for testing SDMs performance and the inclusion of information from the native area and a variety of both human-related and environmental predictors for a more accurate modelling of the range expansion of AIS. Otherwise, models that only include climatic variables, or rely only on standard accuracy measures or a single algorithm, might result in mismanagement of AIS.},

	abstract = {Successful management of natural resources requires local action that adapts to larger‐scale environmental changes in order to maintain populations within the safe operating space (SOS) of acceptable conditions. Here, we identify the boundaries of the SOS for a managed freshwater fishery in the first empirical test of the SOS concept applied to management of harvested resources. Walleye (Sander vitreus) are popular sport fish with declining populations in many North American lakes, and understanding the causes of and responding to these changes is a high priority for fisheries management. We evaluated the role of changing water clarity and temperature in the decline of a high‐profile walleye population in Mille Lacs, Minnesota, USA, and estimated safe harvest under changing conditions from 1987 to 2017. Thermal–optical habitat area (TOHA)—the proportion of lake area in which the optimal thermal and optical conditions for walleye overlap—was estimated using a thermodynamic simulation model of daily water temperatures and light conditions. We then used a SOS model to analyze how walleye carrying capacity and safe harvest relate to walleye thermal–optical habitat. Thermal–optical habitat area varied annually and declined over time due to increased water clarity, and maximum safe harvest estimated by the SOS model varied by nearly an order of magnitude. Maximum safe harvest levels of walleye declined with declining TOHA. Walleye harvest exceeded safe harvest estimated by the SOS model in 16 out of the 30 yr of our dataset, and walleye abundance declined following 14 of those years, suggesting that walleye harvest should be managed to accommodate changing habitat conditions. By quantifying harvest trade‐offs associated with loss of walleye habitat, this study provides a framework for managing walleye in the context of ecosystem change.},

	abstract = {AimNumerous regions worldwide are highly impacted by anthropogenic activities and globalization, with climate change and species introductions being among the greatest stressors to biodiversity and ecosystems. A main donor region of non‐indigenous species (NIS) for numerous European water bodies, as well as in the North American Great Lakes is the Ponto‐Caspian region (i.e., Black, Azov and Caspian Seas), with some of those species having significant impact on local communities and ecosystem functioning.LocationNorthern European, Ponto‐Caspian and North American regions.MethodsTo determine environmental tolerance of native species and related NIS under current and future global warming scenarios of the Baltic Sea, we conducted common garden experiments to test temperature tolerance of three euryhaline gammarid species: one Baltic (Gammarus oceanicus), one Ponto‐Caspian (Pontogammarus maeoticus) and one North American species (Gammarus tigrinus) in two different salinities.ResultsOur results determined that mortality of P. maeoticus in all temperature treatments (i.e., increased, control, and decreased) at the end of both experiments (i.e., conducted in salinities of 10 and 16 g/kg) was lower when compared to mortality of G. oceanicus and (c) G. tigrinus. The highest mortality was observed for G. oceanicus, reaching 100\% in both experiments in the increased temperature treatment.Main conclusionsDue to the high environmental tolerance of the Ponto‐Caspian species tested in this study, as well as the fact that Ponto‐Caspian species evolved in environmentally variable habitats and currently inhabit warmer waters than species from North America and Northern Europe, we suggest that species from the Ponto‐Caspian region may benefit from global warming when invading new areas. Those new invasions may, in the best case scenario, increase biodiversity of the Baltic Sea. However, if notorious invaders arrive, they may have a significant impact on local communities and ecosystem functioning.},

As one of the busiest ports in the world that handles tens of thousands of high invasion-risk vessels annually, Singapore is regarded as being at very high risk for the introduction of NIMS and IMS. However, a compilation of 3,650 marine invertebrates, fishes and plants revealed that only 22 species have been confirmed as NIMS.

The species was found in the port of Gdynia in 2014, while in 2015–2017 it already colonized the western part of the Gulf of Gdansk, inhabiting mainly hard substrates, including both natural (e.g. boulders) and anthropogenic ones (e.g. vertical concrete piles or walls of offshore structures and breakwaters, horizontal PVC plates and oyster shells used as filling in habitat collectors). During the survey period, S. vanhaareni was found in different seasons of the year (from winter and early spring to autumn), which, combined with the presence of ovigerous females as well as high abundance (up to tens of thousands of individuals per square meter), allows us to assume that the species has already established a population in the Gulf of Gdansk.},

	abstract = {In the 1970s, the introduced silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (which is indigenous to eastern Asia) escaped from southern U.S. aquaculture to spread throughout the Mississippi River basin, and since has steadily moved northward. This large, prolific filter-feeder reduces food availability for other fishes. It now has reached the threshold of the Laurentian Great Lakes, where it likely will significantly impact food chains and fisheries. Our study evaluates population genetic variability and differentiation of the silver carp using 10 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci, and sequences of two mitochondrial genes–cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1, along with the nuclear ribosomal protein S7 gene intron 1. We analyze population samples from: two primary Great Lakes’ invasion fronts (at the Illinois River outside of Chicago, IL in Lake Michigan and in the Wabash River, which leads into the Maumee River and western Lake Erie), the original establishment “core” in the Lower Mississippi River, and expansion areas in the Upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers. We analyze and compare our results with bighead and other invasive carps, and cyprinid relatives. Results reveal that the silver carp invasion possesses moderate levels of genetic diversity, with more mtDNA haplotypes and unique microsatellite alleles in the “core” Lower Mississippi River population, which also diverges the most. The two invasion fronts also significantly genetically differ. About 3\% of individuals (including all populations except the Illinois River) contain a unique and very divergent mtDNA haplotype, which likely stems from historic introgression in Asia with female largescale silver carp H. harmandi. The nuclear microsatellites and S7 sequences of the introgressed individuals do not differ from silver carp and are very distant from bighead carp. These sequence variation data are employed to design and evaluate a targeted high-throughput metabarcoding sequence assay that identifies and distinguishes among species of invasive carps (i.e., silver, bighead, grass, black, and common carps, along with goldfish), as well as native cyprinids, using cytochrome b. Our assay further differentiates among selected silver carp haplotypes (including between H. molitrix and H. harmandi), for use in population genetics and future analyses of spread pathways. We test and evaluate this assay on environmental (e)DNA water samples from 48 bait shops in the Great Lakes’ region (along the Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and Wabash River watersheds), using positive and negative controls and custom bioinformatic processing. Test results discern silver carp eDNA in four of the shops–three in Lake Erie and one in the Wabash River watershed–and bighead carp from one of the same Lake Erie venues, suggesting that retailers (who often source from established southerly populations) comprise another introduction vector. Our overall findings thus provide key population genetic and phylogenetic data for understanding and tracing introductions, vectors, and spread pathways for silver carp, their variants, and their relatives.},

Successful conservation outcomes areultimately built on a sound ecological framework in which every species must be assessed and understood at the individual, community, catchment and landscape level of interaction. For example, freshwater ecologists need to understand hydrochemical storages and fluxes, the physical systems influencingfreshwaters at the catchment and landscape scale, and the spatial and temporal processes that maintain species assemblages and their dynamics. A thorough understanding of all these varied processes, and the techniques for studying them, is essential for the effective conservation and management of freshwater ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is of major and increasing importance to global food security, particularly in Low Income, Food Deficit Countries (LIFDCs), where it also serves as a significant contribution to poverty alleviation. Disease is widely acknowledged as the prominent bottleneck to achieving global food security and poverty alleviation targets relating to aquaculture, with annual losses exceeding {\textgreater}\$6bn (Food and Agriculture Organization 2014). Outbreaks of disease caused by endemic and emerging pathogens impact directly on farmer income and their nutritional security. Avoidance of yield-limiting disease outbreaks is a fundamental requirement for future growth and resilience of aquaculture in LIFDCs. Advances in molecular techniques coupled with nextgeneration sequencing have provided a step-change in understanding the role of hostassociated bacteria, archaea, protists and viruses (the microbiome) in host homeostasis. Shifts in microbiome communities under stressful conditions can contribute to disease states. However, the role of microbiomes in the emergence of diseases in aquaculture, where stressors include feeding, antibiotic and disinfectant use and over-stocking, is poorly studied.Here our study presents an evaluation of the microbiomes (bacteria and viruses) associated with tilapia and their pond environments in aquaculture, using 16S rRNA community profiling techniques and viral amplicon sequencing. Samples investigated in this project were collected from Malawi tilapia fish farms; their skin community composition and diversity were examined across geographical scales. The high variability observed of the microbial communities in small geographic regions, showed that future sampling to detect shifts due to dysbiosis will require time-resolved sampling of ponds under study. Nanopore sequencing of full length 16S rRNA genes, using MinION, allowed us to examine the microbial communities at higher taxonomic resolution than short read sequencing techniques. Its success lays the foundation for in-situ microbial profiling of aquaculture ponds for disease, and offers independence to farmers to monitor their own ponds. Successful amplification of the T4-like Myoviridae phylogenetic markers from one rearing water sample was achieved, although the required degeneracy of the primers inhibited multiplexing. Therefore, our findings suggest that inclusion of bacteriophages in microbiome studies is better served using shotgun metagenomic methods, rather than amplicon sequencing.Finally, we investigated the use of skin swabbing as an alternative to bucket incubations to minimise animal stress when categorising the fish skin microbiome. Skin swabbing successfully captured similar microbial communities in comparison to bucket incubations, with greater diversity and variance between fish.},

We sampled benthic macroinvertebrates at 48 sites (44 lotic + 4 lentic), and among 236 taxa, 21 NIMS were identified, of which 9 were widespread and abundant. Only 14.6\% of sites exhibited no biocontamination, 18.7\% exhibited low or moderate biocontamination and 66.7\% exhibited high or severe biocontamination. Higher biocontamination in the Drava may be due to both the proximity to the Danube as the main source of NIMS and the existence of three large reservoirs. We found significantly negative correlation between the number of NIMS and native taxa. The significant correlations between biocontamination indices and tested biological metrics were as follows: negative with \%EPT, EPT-S, BMWP and IBE AQEM, while positive with HR-SI. This indicates that at sites where NIMS are abundant and native taxa scarce, standard biological metrics could provide unreliable results and compromise the assessment of ecological status of large rivers.Alternate abstract: Nous avons étudié la composition des macroinvertébrés non indigènes (NIMS) et le niveau de biocontamination de quatre grands fleuves croates (Danube, Sava, Drava, Mura) pour établir quels paramètres environnementaux sont les plus importants pour la composition des assemblages NIMS et pour déterminer comment les NIMS affectent les paramètres biologiques régulièrement utilisés dans les évaluations écologiques.

	abstract = {Ficopomatus enigmaticus is a marine annelid invasive to many locations around the world. It was first identified as a non-indigenous species in San Francisco Bay, California in the 1920s, and since then it has been found in other parts of California. Because the full extent of the distribution of F. enigmaticus was unknown, I conducted surveys for the presence or absence of this species along the coast of California. Populations of F. enigmaticus were found at 23 of the 136 sites surveyed along the coast of California. Ficopomatus enigmaticus was found to be widespread in San Francisco Bay, Monterey Bay, and southern California.
Next, I examined the role of larval dispersal in the spread of this species. Many marine invertebrates have a planktonic period of their life history where they may be transported far from the parents. Because larvae are difficult to track in nature, I used a computer model to determine how far larvae might be transported by ocean currents. I found that larvae were predicted to travel relatively short distances from the Long Beach Breakwater (a median of 6 km in the summer and a median of 13 km in the winter). While larvae traveled relatively short distances, larvae were transported to sites where adults were not found (e.g., Alamitos Bay). Thus, the model suggests that there are unoccupied sites that are at risk of invasion by larvae.
Finally, I conducted laboratory experiments to determine the role of settlement in the spread of F. enigmaticus. I found larvae settled and metamorphosed at all salinities tested, thus the metamorphosis of larvae is not limited to intermediate salinities only. Additionally, I found that larvae will settle and metamorphose on a variety of substrates from different habitats, but larvae metamorphosed most readily on adult tube. Because larval dispersal and settlement could not explain why F. enigmaticus are not present at more sites, further work should be conducted to understand the spread of this species. Managers should focus on preventing the spread of this species because F. enigmaticus remains difficult to eradicate once it has arrived.},

	abstract = {Freshwater mussels are vitally important to both the health of an aquatic ecosystem and the natural history of our lakes and rivers. Due to anthropogenic influences, Illinois’s river mussel stocks have been heavily impacted and species extirpations are now a norm, not an exception. Because of these declines, conservation action plans now call for the controlled propagation, augmentation, and reintroduction of threatened and endangered freshwater mussel species nationwide. Other states have been actively propagating and reintroducing mussels along with their host fish species for nearly 30 years. Presently, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources is establishing the Aquatic Biodiversity Program to explore the possibility of adding the propagation and culture of freshwater mussels to its fish hatchery system’s scope of work. In addition to mussel propagation infrastructure, the development of release methods at potential reintroduction sites is critical to explore and evaluate effective mussel rearing techniques appropriate for the state’s waters. It is important therefore to investigate ways to both increase survival and growth of hatchery-reared juveniles while exposing these mussels to natural conditions within stream locals. A variety of different in situ cages have been recently developed to house laboratory-cultured juveniles within natural river conditions and at release sites with varying degrees of growth and survivorship reported. This study aims to investigate the effects of mussel silos as an intermediate rearing device on three different Illinois mussel species and explore their effectiveness in two central Illinois watersheds. The results from this project will help inform IDNR’s Aquatic Biodiversity Program of the usefulness of this technique to help assess habitat conditions at selected release sites in suitable river segments as well as protect and acclimate juvenile mussels for reintroduction efforts in the future. Invaluable evidence from pilot studies like this one can help guide mussel conservation efforts during the formation of new facilities and state programs.},

Although many have advocated for deliberative democracy as a pathway towards natural resource sustainability, others remain skeptical because of tradeoffs between theoretical and practical benefits. An environmental lens on deliberative democracy narrows the focus of this analysis to relevant areas of watershed management inquiry. As such, Environmental Deliberative Democracy (EDD) serves as a conceptual synthesis of collaborative principles for analytical purposes. This research design compares the social, economic and political discourses in two Wisconsin watersheds with an established and similar case study in Lake Simcoe, Ontario. The central hypothesis posits that EDD community compatibility is enhanced by public trust in expert capacity and accessible watershed education resources. Further, self-assessments of reactive behaviors are expected to be a limiting factor for EDD compatibility. A mixed methodology is used to analyze quantitative data from citizen surveys and qualitative responses from elite-level interviews. Findings affirm that proactive watershed management frameworks are stronger without being prompted by environmental crises. Similarly, management programs created reactively with a specific agenda have a comparable structure with citizen involvement but have a limited capacity, scope, and potential for sustained success.},

	abstract = {The ecological impacts of invasive species can be severe, but are generally viewed as highly unpredictable. Recent methods combining per capita feeding rates, population abundances and environmental contexts have shown great utility in predicting invader impacts. Here, clearance rates of the invasive Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, and native mussel, Mytilus edulis, were investigated in a laboratory experiment where oscillatory water flow and algal food concentrations were manipulated. Invasive oysters had lower clearance rates than native mussels in all experimental groups and did not differ among flow velocities or food concentrations. Native mussel clearance rates were higher at 5 cm s-1 compared to 0 and 15 cm s-1 flow velocities and increased with increasing food concentration. The Relative Impact Potential (RIP) metric was used to assess (i) the influence of flow velocity and food concentration on potential impacts of C. gigas on plankton resources and, (ii) the impacts of coexisting reefs, containing both species, on resources compared to monospecific native mussel beds. Greatest Relative Impact Potential of invasive oysters was seen at the lowest flow velocity, but became reduced with increasing flow velocity and food concentration. Relative Impact Potentials of coexisting reefs were generally greater than monospecific native mussel beds, with greatest impacts predicted at lowest flow velocity. We suggest that the greatest ecological impacts and competition potential of C. gigas will occur in areas with low flow velocity, but that increased flow will mediate co-existence between the two species.},

	abstract = {Decisions to allocate management resources should be underpinned by estimates of the impacts of biological invasions that are comparable across species and locations. For the same reason, it is important to assess what type of impacts are likely to occur where, and if such patterns can be generalised. In this paper, we aim to understand factors shaping patterns in the type and magnitude of impacts of a subset of alien grasses. We used the Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS) to review and quantify published impact records of 58 grass species that are alien to South Africa and to at least one other biogeographical realm. Based on the GISS scores, we investigated how impact magnitudes varied across habitats, regions and impact mechanisms using multiple regression. We found impact records for 48 species. Cortaderia selloana had the highest overall impact score, although in contrast to five other species (Glyceria maxima, Nassella trichotoma, Phalaris aquatica, Polypogon monspeliensis, and Sorghum halepense) it did not score the highest possible impact score for any specific impact mechanism. Consistent with other studies, we found that the most frequent environmental impact was through competition with native plant species (with 75\% of cases). Socio-economic impacts were recorded more often and tended to be greater in magnitude than environmental impacts, with impacts recorded particularly often on agricultural and animal production (57\% and 51\% of cases respectively). There was variation across different regions and habitats in impact magnitude, but the differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, alien grasses present in South Africa have caused a wide range of negative impacts across most habitats and regions of the world. Reviewing impacts from around the world has provided important information for the management of alien grasses in South Africa, and, we believe, is an important component of management prioritisation processes in general.},

Although these deer have become commonplace on many Texan’s private and public properties, few studies have been performed to determine if their increasing presence is affecting the quality of standing water utilized by deer herds and individuals. Through weekly camera trap and water analyses of paired natural and control water sources, water use behaviors and effects on water quality by A. axis were studied at three sites across the Texas Hill Country - private properties along Baldwin Road in Ingram, Albert and Bessie Kronkosky State Natural Area in Pipe Creek, and HOA-owned property in the community of Fair Oaks Ranch. Camera traps were analyzed weekly with date, animal sighted, timestamp, game camera number, sex, quantity, behaviors, photo tag, and any additional notes being inputted into a comprehensive Excel® spreadsheet. Surface grab samples of both the control tanks and natural water sources were collected during each site visit and were analyzed for seven general water quality markers; nitrates, total dissolved phosphorus, chlorophyll, turbidity, suspended sediment, and coliform bacteria, including Escherichia coli. During this research, the only behaviors exhibited by A. axis regarding water usage were solely those of drinking; other behaviors such as wallowing or territorial marking were not displayed by this species. Water quality analysis appeared to indicate no influence by these deer on contaminant loading into the water sources; paired comparisons indicated minimal significant differences between the control tanks and natural water sources. Contaminant loading by other species, mainly feral hogs, appeared to have a much greater impact on water quality, indicating that A. axis are not causing any significant detrimental effects on standing water bodies within the Texas Hill Country. This study may be used as a baseline analysis of Axis deer behaviors and standing water quality in the Texas Hill Country and may be used to develop more deliberate Axis deer management plans.},

	abstract = {Background 
The invasive alien species may lead to great environmental and economic crisis due to its strong capability of occupying the biological niche of native species and altering the ecosystem of the invaded area. However, its potential to serve as the vectors of some specific zoonotic pathogens, especially parasites, has been neglected. Thus, the damage that it may cause has been hugely underestimated in this aspect, which is actually an important public health problem. This paper aims to discuss the current status of zoonotic parasites carried by invasive alien species in China.
Main body
This review summarizes the reported zoonotic parasites carried by invasive alien species in China based on the Database of Invasive Alien Species in China. We summarize their prevalence, threat to human health, related reported cases, and the roles of invasive alien species in the life cycle of these parasites, and the invasion history of some invasive alien species. Furthermore, we sum up the current state of prevention and control of invasive alien species in China, and discuss about the urgency and several feasible strategies for the prevention and control of these zoonoses under the background of booming international communications and inevitable globalization.
Conclusions
Information of the zoonotic parasites carried by invasive alien species neither in China or worldwide, especially related case reports, is limited due to a long-time neglection and lack of monitoring. The underestimation of their damage requires more attention to the monitoring and control and compulsory measures should be taken to control the invasive alien species carrying zoonotic parasites.},

	abstract = {Understanding the invasive potential of species outside their native range is one of the most pressing questions in applied evolutionary and ecological research. Admixture of genotypes of invasive species from multiple sources has been implicated in successful invasions, by generating novel genetic combinations that facilitate rapid adaptation to new environments. Alternatively, adaptive evolution on standing genetic variation, exposed by phenotypic plasticity and selected by genetic accommodation, can facilitate invasion success. We investigated the population genetic structure of an Asian freshwater mussel with a parasitic dispersal stage, Sinanodonta woodiana, which has been present in Europe since 1979 but which has expanded rapidly in the last decade. Data from a mitochondrial marker and nuclear microsatellites have suggested that all European populations of S. woodiana originate from the River Yangtze basin in China. Only a single haplotype was detected in Europe, in contrast to substantial mitochondrial diversity in native Asian populations. Analysis of microsatellite markers indicated intensive gene flow and confirmed a lower genetic diversity of European populations compared to those from the Yangtze basin, though that difference was not large. Using an Approximate Bayesian Modelling approach, we identified two areas as the probable source of the spread of S. woodiana in Europe, which matched historical records for its establishment. Their populations originated from a single colonization event. Our data do not support alternative explanations for the rapid recent spread of S. woodiana; recent arrival of a novel (cold‐tolerant) genotype or continuous propagule pressure. Instead, in situ adaptation, facilitated by repeated admixture, appears to drive the ongoing expansion of S. woodiana. We discuss management consequences of our results.},

	abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) are considered to be an essential tool for safeguarding marine biodiversity. Sustainable use of the oceans and seas relies on the benefits of MPAs, now even more than ever, due to environmental degradation and anthropogenic impacts on marine ecosystems. Various international and regional agreements require that nations designate sufficiently marine areas under protection. MPAs are powerful tools, if coherent and ecologically efficient. Assessing the functionality of MPA networks is challenging, unless extensive data on underwater species and habitats is available. We evaluated the efficiency of the Finnish MPA network by utilizing a unique new dataset of {\textasciitilde}140 000 samples, collected by the Finnish Inventory Programme for the Underwater Marine Environment VELMU. For the evaluation of MPAs, we used comprehensive data on: species distribution and abundance models for over 100 taxa, IUCN Red List of Ecosystems, fish reproduction areas, EU Habitats Directive Annex I Habitats and human pressures. Using the quantitative conservation planning and spatial prioritization method Zonation, we identified sites of high biodiversity and developed a balanced ranking of underwater conservation values. Only 27 \% of the ecologically most valuable features were covered by the current MPA network. Based on the analyses a set of expansion sites were identified, complementing the ecological and geographical gaps in the current MPA network. Increasing the protected sea area by just one percent with the selection of the most valuable areas indicated by the analysis, the protection level of biological features could be significantly increased. We also discovered that the EU Directive habitats are not in their present form functional proxies for marine benthic species. This suggests that MPA networks based on habitats are not sufficient for safeguarding marine biodiversity in the northern Baltic Sea. Furthermore, the produced rankings are essentially environmental value maps, they can be used in ecosystem-based marine spatial planning and impact avoidance, including, e.g., siting of wind energy or aquaculture. Our approach and analytical procedure can be replicated elsewhere in the Baltic Sea and in other marine areas around the world, provided sufficient data exists.},

	abstract = {In aquatic systems, food web linkages are often assessed using diet contents, stable isotope ratios, and, increasingly, fatty acid composition of organisms. Some correlations between different trophic metrics are assumed to be well-supported; for example, particular stable isotope ratios and fatty acids seem to reflect reliance on benthic or pelagic energy pathways. However, understanding whether the assumed correlations between different trophic metrics are coherent and consistent across species represents a key step toward their effective use in food web studies. To assess links among trophic markers, we compared relationships between major diet components, fatty acids, and stable isotope ratios in three fishes: yellow perch (Perca flavescens), round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) collected from nearshore Lake Michigan. Yellow perch and spottail shiner are native in this system, while round goby are a relatively recent invader. We found some evidence for agreement between different trophic metrics, especially between diet components, n-3:n-6 fatty acid ratios, and stable isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N). However, we also observed significant variation in observed relationships among markers and species, potentially due to taxonomic variation in the specific diet items consumed (e.g., chydorid microcrustaceans and Dreissena mussels) and species-specific biochemical processes. In many of these latter cases, the invasive species differed from the native species. Understanding the effects of taxonomic variation on prey and predator signatures could significantly improve the usefulness of fatty acids in food web studies, whereas diet contents and stable isotopes appear to be reliable indicators of trophic niche in aquatic food webs.},

This step is often challenging, especially when data and introduced species expertise is limited: yet decisions about responding to a new invasion needs to occur in a timely manner. The crux is that biosecurity crisis decisions are often made in a vacuum. To improve this process, we outline a rapid response approach that uses a non-probabilistic decision tree to direct decision makers, with additional criteria to determine if a species is native, cryptogenic or introduced. The expanded criteria were derived from patterns within a 10-year dataset of quantitative introduced marine species surveys and is compared against the original Chapman and Carlton 10-point criteria for identifying a species status. Effective use of the rapid response decision-tree and species criteria requires a multi-disciplinary approach drawing upon biology (taxonomy, phylogeny, genetics, ecology, biogeography) and monitoring. The criteria are evaluated against 213 bryozoan species present in Australian waters that were randomly selected from species present in the Australian port surveys and available in the scientific and grey literature. A multivariate evaluation highlighted that a weight of evidence using the expanded criteria approach was successful in determining if a species is introduced or native, and that a number of criteria may be rarely met but when they are met, they provide strong evidence that a species is introduced. The expanded criteria clearly differentiated introduced and cryptogenic species from native species and consequently would reduce mis-classifications of introduced species as native species (Type I error) in comparison to the original criteria. However, differentiating between introduced and cryptogenic species was problematic, especially when using the original criteria. Using both the rapid response decision tree and the criteria provides a quantifiable mechanism to aid decision-makers in deciding whether to respond to a marine species introduction.},

	abstract = {To enable successful management of marine bioinvasions, timely and robust scientific advice is required. This knowledge should inform managers and stakeholders on the magnitude of a pressure (rate of human-mediated introductions), the environmental state of an ecosystem (impacts of non-indigenous species), and the success of management response (prevention, eradication, mitigation). This advice often relies on baseline biodiversity information in the form of measureable parameters (metrics). This can be derived from conventional approaches such as visual surveys, but also by utilizing environmental DNA/RNA-based molecular techniques, which are increasingly being touted as promising tools for assessing biodiversity and detecting rare or invasive species. Depending on the stage of incursion, each approach has merits and limitations. In this review we assess the performance of biosecurity-relevant biodiversity parameters derived from eDNA/eRNA samples and discuss the results in relation to different stages of invasion and management applications. The overall performance of considered methods ranged between 42 and 75\% based on defined criteria, with target-specific approaches scoring higher in general. Caveats are discussed along with avenues which may enhance these techniques and their successful uptake for marine biosecurity surveillance and management. To facilitate and encourage uptake of these techniques, there is a need for an international collaborative framework aimed at unifying molecular sampling and analysis methodologies. Improvement of quantitative capacity and cost-efficiency will also enhance their integration in biosecurity programmes.},

	abstract = {Aquatic alien invasive species (AIS) are a substantial and increasing threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide. In particular, invasive aquatic macrophytes, such as the South African curly waterweed Lagarosiphon major ((Ridley) Moss 1928), induce major environmental change that often culminates in wide-ranging ecological and socio-economic impacts. Currently, there is a lack of effective biosecurity protocols to mitigate against such invader spread. Here, we examine the efficacy of a broad-spectrum aquatic disinfectant, Virasure® Aquatic, to induce mortality of L. major propagule stages. We assessed the efficacy of Virasure® Aquatic at contact times of 1, 2 and 5 minutes, using 1\% (10g L-1) and 4\% (40g L-1) concentrations. A necrosis scale was applied to visually assess tissue degradation. Necrosis increased with longer chemical contact times, with fragment degradation optimised at 2 minutes at 1\% concentration and 1 minute at 4\% concentration. Mode of application was also critical to treatment effectiveness, with spray treatments less effective than submersion treatments. We recommend the use of Virasure® Aquatic via submersion for a minimum period of 2 minutes at 1\% concentration or higher. While spray applications should be applied when submersion is not feasible, such as with large water craft, increased spray times beyond those assessed here should be examined. However, results presented suggest that Virasure® Aquatic can effectively reduce the secondary spread of invasive L. major, and may thus form an integral part of biosecurity protocols. The use of broad-spectrum disinfectants and other readily available treatments, that were not purposefully developed for aquatic AIS control but nevertheless are emerging as effective in aquatic AIS management, is discussed and encouraged.},

We highlight the utility of abundance–impact curves for three questions. First, abundance–impact relationships can clarify whether prevention and management should focus on the species likely to become abundant or those likely to cause large impacts per individual. Second, comparing abundance–impact relationships between native and exotic species can reveal any systematic differences in their effects on ecological systems. Third, identifying any thresholds in the relationship between invader impact and abundance can be used to select management targets and design invasive species control strategies. With increasing extent and resolution of datasets of invasive organisms worldwide, we now have the opportunity to explore in detail the form and context dependence of the abundance–impact relationship. Doing so provides opportunities to improve the prediction of invader impact, to better understand the differences between exotic and resident organisms, and to scale the impacts of invasive species from localities to ranges.},

	abstract = {The invasive silver carp Hypophthalmichthys molitrix escaped from southern U.S. aquaculture during the 1970s to spread throughout the Mississippi River basin and steadily moved northward, now reaching the threshold of the Laurentian Great Lakes. The silver carp is native to eastern Asia and is a large, prolific filter-feeder that decreases food availability for fisheries. The present study evaluates its population genetic variability and differentiation across the introduced range using 10 nuclear DNA microsatellite loci, sequences of two mitochondrial genes (cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1), and a nuclear gene (ribosomal protein S7 gene intron 1). Populations are analyzed from two invasion fronts threatening the Great Lakes (the Illinois River outside Lake Michigan and the Wabash River, leading into the Maumee River and western Lake Erie), established areas in the southern and central Mississippi River, and a later Missouri River colonization. Results discern considerable genetic diversity and some significant population differentiation, with greater mtDNA haplotype diversity and unique microsatellite alleles characterizing the southern populations. Invasion fronts significantly differ, diverging from the southern Mississippi River population. About 3\% of individuals contain a unique and very divergent mtDNA haplotype (primarily the southerly populations and the Wabash River), which may stem from historic introgression in Asia with female largescale silver carp H. harmandi. Nuclear microsatellites and S7 sequences of the introgressed individuals do not significantly differ from silver carp. MtDNA variation is used in a high-throughput sequence assay that identifies and distinguishes invasive carp species and their population haplotypes (including H. molitrix and H. harmandi) at all life stages, in application to environmental (e)DNA water and plankton samples. We discerned silver and bighead carp eDNA from four bait and pond stores in the Great Lakes watershed, indicating that release from retailers comprises another likely vector. Our findings provide key baseline population genetic data for understanding and tracing the invasion���s progression, facilitating detection, and evaluating future trajectory and adaptive success.},

Therefore, resistance to diverse predators resulting from a universal anti-predator strategy seems crucial for invasion success. We present a comprehensive review of the responses of an invasive amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus to sympatric and allopatric predator signals. We summarize diverse aspects of the gammarid anti-predator strategy, including predator identification, morphological and behavioural adaptations, effectiveness of shelter use and resistance to indirect predator effects. The response of D. villosus is independent of predator species (including totally allopatric taxa), which assures the high flexibility of its predator recognition system. It has a harder exoskeleton and better capability of utilizing shelters compared to other gammarids, resulting in relatively high resistance to predators. Therefore, it can use predator kairomones as indirect food signals (sharing the diet with the predator) and follow the predator scent. This resistance may allow D. villosus to reduce the costs of its physiological responses to predators and sustain growth in their presence. This might facilitate invasion success by increasing its competitive advantage.},

	abstract = {Limnoperna fortunei (Dunker 1857) is a freshwater mussel with physiological tolerance to different environmental conditions, which may explain its success as an invasive species. The role of abiotic factors in its establishment, abundance and projections of risk of further spread into several areas has been studied. These mussels may respond to multiple environmental stressors, such as temperature, through physiological mechanisms, behavioral responses, mortality or some combination of these. The aim of this study was to investigate the behavioral responses (valve closing), glycogen concentrations and mortality of L. fortunei under four different temperatures (5°C, 10°C, 20°C and 30°C) during a chronic test (30 days). Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare glycogen concentrations across days of the experiment and at the different temperatures. Differences in valve-closing behavior and mortality among temperatures were tested using repeated-measures ANOVA. We observed that most of the mussels maintained at 5°C closed their valves (74.7±15.3\%), indicating that they remain inactive at low temperatures. The glycogen levels significantly differed among the temperatures tested. These differences occurred mainly due to the high glycogen values observed in mussels exposed to 10°C. Stability in glycogen concentrations was observed within each particular temperature. The cumulative mortality was higher at extreme temperatures (5°C and 30°C). The ideal temperature for laboratory maintenance and tests is approximately 20°C. Our data also show that L. fortunei can survive and maintain their energy reserves (glycogen) for several days at 5°C, an important feature related to its invasion success.},

For this purpose, we have analysed two different mussels’ species, reciprocally introduced in antipode areas: the Mediterranean blue mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and the New Zealand pygmy mussel Xenostrobus securis, widely recognized invaders outside their native distribution ranges. The demetylathion was higher in more stressed population, supporting the idea of epigenetic is involved in plasticity process. These results can open a new management protocols, using the epigenetic signals as potential pollution monitoring tool.

	doi = {10.1101/356923},
	abstract = {Inter Basin Water Transfers (IBWT) are recognized as one of the major pathways of freshwater invasion. They provide a direct link between previously isolated catchments and may modify the habitat conditions of the receiving waters such that they become more favourable for the establishment of invasive species. Combined, IBWT and invasive species will intensify the stress upon native species and ecosystems. Using the Severn and Thames Rivers, two of the largest river systems in Great Britain, as a case study, here we assess the potential influence of IBWT on the expansion of invasive species and thus their impact on biodiversity conservation. The Thames Valley is subject to extensive water abstraction, and an increasing population means that supplemented flow from the River Severn is being considered. Multi-scale Suitability Models, based on climate and water chemistry respectively, provided novel evidence that there is serious risk for further spread of invasive species in the focus area, particularly of the quagga mussel, a recent invader of the Thames River. Native freshwater mussels are particularly vulnerable to changing environmental conditions, and may suffer the decrease in alkalinity and increase in sedimentation associated with an IBWT from the lower Severn to the upper Thames. Regional models suggest considerable overlap between the areas suitable for three vulnerable native freshwater mussels and the expansion of invasive species that negatively impact upon the native mussels. This study illustrates the use of novel spatially-explicit techniques to help managers make informed decisions about the risks associated with introducing aquatic invasive species under different engineering scenarios. Such information may be especially important under new legislation (e.g. EU Invasive Species Regulation No 1143/2014) which increases the responsibility of water managers to contain and not transfer invasive species into new locations.},

	abstract = {Blooms of filamentous benthic algae that plagued Lake Erie in the 1950s through 1970s were largely reduced through reductions of phosphorus (P) loading from point sources. Since the mid-1990s, these blooms have returned despite a period of relatively stable external P inputs. While increased loadings of dissolved P have been causally linked to cyanobacterial blooms in some parts of the lake, the impacts of ecosystem changes such as the effect of invasive species on nutrient cycling and availability have not been fully elucidated, leading to uncertainty as to the effectiveness of additional non-point P management actions. Here we use the oxygen isotope ratios (18OP) of phosphate in concert with measures of water quality along the northern shore of the east basin of Lake Erie to identify sources and pathways of P cycling and infer potential importance in relation to annual blooms of Cladophora that foul the shorelines of eastern Lake Erie. 18OP data indicate that potential external source signatures are rapidly overprinted by biological cycling of P by the plankton community and that much of the available phosphate in the nearshore waters is derived from hydrolysis of dissolved organic P compounds. Near the dreissenid-colonized lake bed, 18OP was persistently and significantly enriched in 18O relative to 18OP measured in surface waters and was similar to 18OP of phosphate excreted by dreissenid mussels in incubations. These results implicate dreissenid mussels as key agents in nearshore P cycling and highlight the importance of considering ecosystem changes in the development of nutrient management strategies designed to ameliorate symptoms of eutrophication.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions threaten biodiversity in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, requiring substantial conservation and management efforts. To examine how the conservation planning literature addresses biological invasions and if planning in the marine environment could benefit from experiences in the freshwater and terrestrial systems, we conducted a global systematic review. Out of 1149 scientific articles mentioning both ‘conservation planning’ and ‘alien’ or any of its alternative terms, 70 articles met our selection criteria. Most of the studies were related to the terrestrial environment, while only 10\% focused on the marine one. The main conservation targets were species (mostly vertebrates) rather than habitats or ecosystems. Apart from being mentioned, alien species were considered of concern for conservation in only 46\% of the cases, while mitigation measures were proposed in only 13\% of the cases. The vast majority of the studies (73\%) ignored alien species in conservation planning even if their negative impacts were recognized. In 20\% of the studies, highly invaded areas were avoided in the planning, while in 6\% of the cases such areas were prioritized for conservation. In the latter case, two opposing approaches led to the selection of invaded areas: either alien and native biodiversity were treated equally in setting conservation targets, i.e. alien species were also considered as ecological features requiring protection, or more commonly invaded sites were prioritized for the implementation of management actions to control or eradicate invasive alien species. When the ‘avoid’ approach was followed, in most of the cases highly impacted areas were either excluded or invasive alien species were included in the estimation of a cost function to be minimized. Most of the studies that followed a ‘protect’ or ‘avoid’ approach dealt with terrestrial or freshwater features but in most cases the followed approach could be transferred to the marine environment. Gaps and needs for further research are discussed and we propose an 11-step framework to account for biological invasions into the systematic conservation planning design.},

Many fish species have been introduced in wild ecosystems around the world to provide food or leisure, deliberately or from farm escapes. Some of those introductions have had large ecological effects. The north American native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum, 1792) is one of the most widely farmed fish species in the world. It was first introduced in Spain in the late 19th century for sport fishing (Elvira 1995) and nowadays is used there for both fishing and aquaculture. On the other hand, the European native brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) is catalogued as vulnerable in Spain. Detecting native and invasive fish populations in ecosystem monitoring is crucial, but it may be difficult from conventional sampling methods such as electrofishing. These techniques encompass some mortality, thus are not adequate for some ecosystems as the case of protected areas. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a sensitive and non-invasive method that can be especially useful for rare and low-density species detection and inventory in water bodies.
Methods
In this study we employed two eDNA based methods (qPCR and nested PCR-RFLP) to detect salmonid species from mountain streams within a protected area, The Biosphere Reserve and Natural Park of Redes (Upper Nalón Basin, Asturias, Northern Spain), where brown trout is the only native salmonid. We also measured some habitat variables to see how appropriate for salmonids the area is. The sampling area is located upstream impassable dams and contains one rainbow trout fish farm.
Results
Employing qPCR methodology, brown trout eDNA was detected in all the nine sampling sites surveyed, while nested PCR-RFLP method failed to detect it in two sampling points. Rainbow trout eDNA was detected with both techniques at all sites in the Nalón River’ (n1, n2 and n3). Salmonid habitat units and water quality were high from the area studied.
Discussion
In this study, a high quantity of rainbow trout eDNA was found upstream and downstream of a fish farm located inside a Biosphere Reserve. Unreported escapes from the fish farm are a likely explanation of these results. Since salmonid habitat is abundant and the water quality high, the establishment of rainbow trout populations would be favored should escapes occur. Environmental DNA has here proved to be a valuable tool for species detection in freshwater environments, and the probe-based qPCR highly sensitive technique for detection of scarce species. We would recommend this method for routine monitoring and early detection of introduced species within natural reserves.},

	abstract = {Early detection is imperative for successful control or eradication of invasive species, but many organisms are difficult to detect at the low abundances characteristic of recently introduced populations. Environmental DNA (eDNA) has emerged as a promising invasive species surveillance tool for freshwaters, owing to its high sensitivity to detect aquatic species even when scarce. We report here a new eDNA assay for the globally invasive Asian clam Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774), with field validation in large lakes of western North America. We identified a candidate primer pair for the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene for C. fluminea. We tested it for specificity via qPCR assay against genomic DNA of the target species C. fluminea, and synthetic DNA gBlocks for other non-target species within and outside of the genus Corbicula. Our best identified primer amplifies a 208-bp fragment for C. fluminea and several closely related species within the genus, but was specific for these non-native Asian clams relative to native mollusks of western North America. We further evaluated this assay in application to eDNA water samples for the detection of C. fluminea from four lakes in California and Nevada, United States, where the species is known to occur (including Lake Tahoe) relative to seven lakes where it has never been observed. Our assay successfully detected C. fluminea in all four lakes with historic records for this species, and did not detect C. fluminea from the seven lakes without known populations. Further, the distribution of eDNA detections within Lake Tahoe generally matched the known, restricted distribution of C. fluminea in this large lake. We conclude from this successful field validation that our eDNA assay for C. fluminea will be useful for researchers and managers seeking to detect new introductions and potentially monitor population trends of this major freshwater invader and other closely related members of its genus.},

In the video, gobies used rotational or twist feeding to tear away particles from crushed mussels. At least 43 examples of this feeding maneuver occur in the video. Up to 120 gobies m−2 were visible at a time in the video. Mean standard length of gobies appearing in the video was 37 mm. Mean standard length of fish exhibiting twist feeding was larger, 48 mm. Mean size of intact mussels in visible clusters was about 10 × 20 mm, a size which exceeds the gape width of the largest gobies observed in the video. Neogobius melanostomus is known to use twisting to wrest small attached mussels from the substrates which can be crushed by their pharyngeal teeth. I surmise that the behavior observed in the video is an opportunistic manifestation of this inherent behavioral adaptation to overcome gap limitation and exploit a temporary windfall of food.},

We studied the invasion performance of one of the most invasive species worldwide, the round goby Neogobius melanostomus, from total absence over first occurrence until establishment from 2010 to 2015 in the upper Danube River. After an upstream movement of the invasion front of about 30 river km within four years, the pattern that round goby pioneering populations significantly differ from longer established ones has been confirmed: Pioneering populations at the invasion front comprised more females than males, and adult specimens with a larger body size compared to those at longer inhabited areas. On the population-level, the proportion of juveniles increased with time since invasion. The results of this study provide support for the previously postulated ´bigger is better´ and ´individual trait utility´ hypotheses explaining invasion success in round goby. Pioneering invaders with their greater exploratory behavior, highly adaptive phenotypic plasticity and increased competitive ability seem to act as prime emperors of new habitats, strongly following and benefiting from man-made river-bank structures.},

	abstract = {Historically, stream ecology was formed on the basis of measuring how much organic matter rivers move downstream, and the “processing continuum” as this organic material is alternatively deposited, processed, and further transported. A significant amount of material is continuously exported from headwater streams, and via advection can be moved long distances downstream prior to processing. Along the way, these materials exchange rapidly between the water column and streambed, migrating downstream in alternating deposition and resuspension events called saltation, and are influenced by complexity in the physical and biologically template of stream structure. A new focus in ecology is understanding how “novel materials” are transported, retained, and persist in stream and river ecosystems. Despite many potential controls over material transport in streams and rivers, we often treat the transport of these materials as a homogenous process in the environment because we lack empirical observations addressing the complexity inherent in natural systems. Therefore, the overarching objective of my dissertation is to improve understanding of the transport, retention, and persistence of two novel materials that are actively transported by flowing waters using a combination of empirical and modeling approaches, spanning lab to watershed experimental scales. More specifically, I investigate the dynamics and transport of two novel materials: environmental DNA (eDNA) and a genetically modified protein (Cry1Ab).},

	abstract = {Decisions to allocate management resources should be underpinned by estimates of the impacts of biological invasions that are comparable across species and locations. For the same reason, it is important to assess what type of impacts are likely to occur where, and if such patterns can be generalised. In this paper, we aim to understand factors shaping patterns in the type and magnitude of impacts of a subset of alien grasses. We used the Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS) to review and quantify published impact records of 58 grass species that are alien to South Africa and to at least one other biogeographical realm. Based on the GISS scores, we investigated how impact magnitudes varied across habitats, regions and impact mechanisms using multiple regression. We found impact records for 48 species.  Cortaderia selloana  had the highest overall impact score, although in contrast to five other species ( Glyceria maxima ,  Nassella trichotoma ,  Phalaris aquatica ,  Polypogon monspeliensis , and  Sorghum halepense  ) it did not score the highest possible impact score for any specific impact mechanism. Consistent with other studies, we found that the most frequent environmental impact was through competition with native plant species (with 75\% of cases). Socio-economic impacts were recorded more often and tended to be greater in magnitude than environmental impacts, with impacts recorded particularly often on agricultural and animal production (57\% and 51\% of cases respectively). There was variation across different regions and habitats in impact magnitude, but the differences were not statistically significant. In conclusion, alien grasses present in South Africa have caused a wide range of negative impacts across most habitats and regions of the world. Reviewing impacts from around the world has provided important information for the management of alien grasses in South Africa, and, we believe, is an important component of management prioritisation processes in general.},

	abstract = {Stable isotope analyses of food webs have been used in previous decades to determine trophic sources and food web structures. The use of stable isotope models to estimate consumption contributions is based on a type of multivariate beta distribution called the Dirichlet distribution. The Dirichlet distribution does not conclude the pi = 0 and pi = 1 situation. Thus, scientists have previously assumed that every potential trophic source contributes to consumption in stable isotope models. However, animals have dietary preferences and some trophic resources may not contribute to consumption. Less is known about the effects of species-specific dietary processes on stable isotope analyses, especially in regard to trophic contribution estimation. In this study, we develop methods to determine consumers’ “real potential trophic sources” and “discrimination factors” using lab-based observations and lab-based discrimination experiments. We describe a dietary process-based stable isotope mixing model (D-SIMM) that integrates lab-based dietary preference observations and the stable isotope mixing model (SIMM) to estimate trophic contributions. Then, we present the application of D-SIMM on three representative macroinvertebrate species in our study area (sea urchin: Anthocidaris crassispina (A. crassispina); gastropod: Turbo cornutus (T. cornutus); and mussel: Septifer virgatus (S. virgatus)) to re-evaluate source-consumer contributions. Thus, we compare the differences between the source contribution estimation results of SIMM and D-SIMM by calculating the standardized convex hull area (TA) of species-specific trophic sources and the consumer standard ellipses area (SEA) of the potential trophic source group. Three examples illustrate significant differences in species-specific dietary preferences between consumers, resulting in systematic difference for TA, SEA and trophic source contribution estimation results between SIMM and D-SIMM. As such, D-SIMM explains pi = 0 of certain trophic sources, which often causes uncertainty and is ignored in previous SIMM research. In addition, species-specific discrimination factors should be noticed during trophic source estimation. For estimation of the trophic contribution of source-consumers, our findings imply that the dietary preferences of consumers should be fully considered before SIMM analysis, and that D-SIMM is a more ecological process and robust measure. Additionally, we found high macroalgae (MAC) coverage in seaweed beds and a high detritus contribution of MAC to sedimentary organic matter (SOM). These findings, combined with the high contributions of MAC and SOM to consumers, suggest that MAC and its debris are the basal trophic sources for gastropods, sea urchins and mussels in seaweed bed habitats. The conservation of seaweed beds should be fully considered to ensure sustainable utilization of shellfish.},

	abstract = {The island apple snail, Pomacea maculata (Gastropoda:Ampullariidae), is an invasive freshwater gastropod native to South America that is currently established in several southeastern states, including South Carolina. It is considered invasive due to the negative impacts associated with intense grazing, high fecundity, an ability to out-compete native species, and the potential to serve as a host for the rat lungworm nematode parasite (Angiostrongylus cantonensis), which can cause eosinophilic meningitis in humans. The first aim of this study was to determine the population genetic structure and genetic diversity of this species in South Carolina and Georgia using microsatellite markers. The second aim was to determine the frequency of occurrence of A. cantonensis in P. maculata in South Carolina using a quantitative real-time PCR assay. The third aim was to determine the salinity tolerance of P. maculata hatchlings exposed to constant salinity treatments (0, 4, 8, 12, 16 psu). Overall, genetic diversity was low at all locations and significant genetic structure was observed among all sampling locations, with the exception of the two sites in Kingsland, GA. These results indicate that the populations in South Carolina and Georgia were likely the result of separate introductions and that these populations are genetically isolated. The low genetic diversity observed could indicate these populations may be susceptible to eradication efforts and/or environmental changes. No positive detections of A. cantonensis were found in any P. maculata, indicating the absence of this parasite in P. maculata in South Carolina. 100\% hatchling survival was observed at 0 psu, and 0\% survival was observed at both 12 and 16 psu. Survival probabilities at 4 psu and 8 psu were 0.925 and 0.156, respectively. These results demonstrate the ability of P. maculata to survive salinities as high as 8 psu, a salinity that is representative of upstream estuarine habitats in coastal South Carolina.},

This molecule is known to be bioaccumulated by bivalves. However, little data about its toxic effects on freshwater mussels is available, particularly on the hemolymphatic compartment and its hemocyte cells involved in various physiological processes such as immune defenses, digestion and excretion, tissue repair, and shell production. Here we exposed Dreissena polymorpha to dissolved BMAA, at the environmental concentration of 7.5 µg of /mussel/3 days, during 21 days followed by 14 days of depuration in clear water, with the objective of assessing the BMAA presence in the hemolymphatic compartment, as well as the impact of the hemocyte cells in terms of potential cytotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and genotoxiciy. Data showed that hemocytes were in contact with BMAA. The presence of BMAA in hemolymph did not induce significant effect on hemocytes phagocytosis activity. However, significant DNA damage on hemocytes occurred during the first week (days 3 and 8) of BMAA exposure, followed by an increase of hemocyte mortality after 2 weeks of exposure. Those effects might be an indirect consequence of the BMAA-induced oxidative stress in cells. However, DNA strand breaks and mortality did not persist during the entire exposure, despite the BMAA persistence in the hemolymph, suggesting potential induction of some DNA-repair mechanisms.},

Absent a cohesive coordinated effort to assess trends in important large river resources, a logical starting point is to assess our ability to draw inferences from existing efforts. In this paper, we use a common analytical framework to analyze data from five disparate fish monitoring programs to better understand the nature of spatial and temporal trends in large river fish assemblages. We evaluated data from programs that monitor fishes in the Colorado, Columbia, Illinois, Mississippi, and Tallapoosa rivers using non-metric dimensional scaling ordinations and associated tests to evaluate trends in fish assemblage structure and native fish biodiversity. Our results indicate that fish assemblages exhibited significant spatial and temporal trends in all five of the rivers. We also document native species diversity trends that were variable within and between rivers and generally more evident in rivers with higher species richness and programs of longer duration. We discuss shared and basin-specific landscape level stressors. Having a basic understanding of the nature and extent of trends in fish assemblages is a necessary first step towards understanding factors affecting biodiversity and fisheries in large rivers.},

	abstract = {Environmental DNA (eDNA) is revolutionizing biodiversity monitoring, occupancy estimates, and real-time detections of invasive species. In the Great Lakes, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), an invasive benthic fish from the Black Sea, has spread to encompass all five lakes and many tributaries, outcompeting or consuming native species; however, estimates of round goby abundance are confounded by behavior and habitat preference, which impact reliable methods for estimating their population. By integrating eDNA into round goby monitoring, improved estimates of biomass may be obtainable. We conducted mesocosm experiments to estimate rates of goby DNA shedding and decay. Further, we compared eDNA with several methods of traditional field sampling to compare its use as an alternative/complementary monitoring method. Environmental DNA decay was comparable to other fish species, and first-order decay was lower at 12°C (k = 0.043) than at 19°C (k = 0.058). Round goby eDNA was routinely detected in known invaded sites of Lake Michigan and its tributaries (range log10 4.8–6.2 CN/L), but not upstream of an artificial fish barrier. Traditional techniques (mark-recapture, seining, trapping) in Lakes Michigan and Huron resulted in fewer, more variable detections than eDNA, but trapping and eDNA were correlated (Pearson R = 0.87). Additional field testing will help correlate round goby abundance with eDNA, providing insight on its role as a prey fish and its impact on food webs.},

Currently there are 29 sites (representing 28 water bodies) reported to have the invasive Asian clam in Massachusetts.

In an infested unnamed tributary in Forest Park, Springfield, MA, a high abundance of 6,124 clams/m² was recorded.

	abstract = {Apocorophium lacustre (Vanhoffen, 1911) is a recent colonizer of freshwater ecosystems in the United States of America and Europe. This species is native primarily to estuarine environments on both sides of the North Atlantic, but in the US it has been established in the Gulf of Mexico since at least 1982 and more recently in the Mississippi River Basin. In 2005 it was found in the Dresden Island Pool of the Upper Illinois River, placing it within 100 river kilometers of Lake Michigan, and it is considered a high risk for continuing its spread into the Laurentian Great Lakes. During summer 2015 we conducted what we believe is the only sampling for this species to have taken place upstream of the Dresden Island Pool since 2005. We sampled at 25 sites from the Dresden Island Pool upstream to Lake Michigan, including six Lake Michigan harbors. A. lacustre was found at a single site in the Dresden Island Pool, indicating that the species has not spread over the last decade. This result could occur because of a physical or chemical barrier to further movement, or because our sampling was not sufficient to locate the population. Further sampling, and tests of A. lacustre tolerance to water from different sources, will be required to determine if spread has truly stopped, and if so, the reason for this.},

So far, few mechanistic, semi-mechanistic or statistical solutions like dispersal constraints or propagule limitation have been applied. We evaluated a novel quasi-semi-mechanistic approach for regional scale models, using historical proximity variables (HPV) representing a state of the population in a given moment in the past. Our aim was to test the effects of addition of HPV sets of different minimal recentness, information capacity and the total number of variables on the quality of the species distribution model for Heracleum mantegazzianum on 116000 km2 in Poland. As environmental predictors, we used fragments of 103 1×1 km, world- wide, free-access rasters from WorldGrids.org. Single and ensemble models were computed using BIOMOD2 package 3.1.47 working in R environment 3.1.0. The addition of HPV improved the quality of single and ensemble models from poor to good and excellent. The quality was the highest for the variants with HPVs based on the distance from the most recent past occurrences. It was mostly affected by the algorithm type, but all HPV traits (minimal recentness, information capacity, model type or the number of the time periods) were significantly important determinants. The addition of HPVs improved the quality of current projections, raising the occurrence probability in regions where the species had occurred before. We conclude that HPV addition enables semi-realistic estimation of the rate of spread and can be applied to the short-term forecasting of invasive or declining species, which also break equal-dispersal probability assumptions.},

	abstract = {Invasive earthworm species, such as Lumbricus rubellus, can cause changes to forest soils, which may result in reduced forest biodiversity. Individual Based Modeling (IBM) offers a way to predict the spread of invasive species and can provide insight for control. We developed an individual-based, spatially explicit, earthworm population dynamics modeling software package (WORMSPREAD). This software accounts for environmental interactions and individual variation that impact population growth and behavior of earthworms. In the model, individual earthworms are affected by temperature and pH, resulting in changes in reproduction, growth, movement and mortality. WORMSPREAD allows ecologists and conservation biologists to test invasion scenarios with simulations that involve variations in landscape structure and demographic parameters that potentially affect abundance and distribution of invasive earthworm species. The user interface is easy to learn and flexible enough to incorporate new data. Results can help determine where to concentrate conservation efforts and control strategies. An example study of the spread of L. rubellus in a portion of the Adirondack Park in upstate New York demonstrates computational experiments that can be conducted with WORMSPREAD. WORMSPREAD can be used to predict population growth in real landscapes, with real variation in environmental conditions. However, it will only lead to accurate predictions if the underlying physiological and behavioral traits of the invading species are known. Indeed, our assessment of these traits for L. rubellus indicates that more data are needed for this species, and the situation is likely to be more challenging for less well-studied species. Thus we encourage more studies that relate the physiology and behavior of invasive species to variability of environmental conditions in invaded habitats.},

	abstract = {Predators shape prey populations by elimination of individuals (consumptive effects) and by inducing modifications in prey behaviour, physiology or morphology (NCE—non-consumptive effects). Due to the resource allocation to defence, decreased feeding and higher stress, the costs of predator NCEs can be considerable. Therefore, the resistance to NCEs may be crucial for population growth and interspecific competition. We tested the resistance of Ponto-Caspian gammarids Dikerogammarus villosus and Pontogammarus robustoides to NCEs imposed by their predator, the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus. As D. villosus is often avoided by predators in the presence of alternative food, we hypothesised that it would bear lower behavioural and physiological costs of anti-predator responses. We tested gammarid feeding in short-time experiments (2–4 h) with food (chironomid larvae) located at various distances from the stony shelter (to enforce food searching, Experiment I) or in the direct gammarid proximity (no searching needed, Experiment II). Moreover, we checked the predator effect on gammarid growth in a 2-week Experiment III. Both gammarids exposed to predators reduced feeding efficiency outside the shelter (Experiment I). Contrary to our expectations, the response of D. villosus was stronger. When food was provided in their direct proximity (Experiment II), the feeding of both species was unaffected by predators, indicating that a shelter supplied with food can reduce predator NCEs. The growth of P. robustoides was reduced in the presence of predators (Experiment III), whereas that of D. villosus was unaffected. Although D. villosus has a more effective defence strategy than P. robustoides, it bears similar or even higher behavioural costs of NCEs. However, it exhibits the higher resistance to the long-term predator presence, sustaining its growth rate under such conditions. This may be one of the factors contributing to the great invasion success of D. villosus, currently taking place in European fresh waters.},

	abstract = {Targeted qPCR and non-targeted amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes within sediment layers identified the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) niche and characterized microbial community changes attributable to freshwater mussels. Anammox bacteria were normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk normality test, W-statistic =0.954, p = 0.773) between 1 and 15 cm depth and were increased by a factor of 2.2 (p {\textless} 0.001) at 3 cm below the water-sediment interface when mussels were present. Amplicon sequencing of sediment at depths relevant to mussel burrowing (3 and 5 cm) showed that mussel presence reduced observed species richness (p = 0.005), Chao1 diversity (p = 0.005), and Shannon diversity (p {\textless} 0.001), with more pronounced decreases at 5 cm depth. A non-metric, multidimensional scaling model showed that intersample microbial species diversity varied as a function of mussel presence, indicating that sediment below mussels harbored distinct microbial communities. Mussel presence corresponded with a 4-fold decrease in a majority of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified in the phyla Gemmatimonadetes, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Plantomycetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Crenarcheota, and Verrucomicrobia. 38 OTUs in the phylum Nitrospirae were differentially abundant (p {\textless} 0.001) with mussels, resulting in an overall increase from 25\% to 35\%. Nitrogen (N)-cycle OTUs significantly impacted by mussels belonged to anammmox genus Candidatus Brocadia, ammonium oxidizing bacteria family Nitrosomonadaceae, ammonium oxidizing archaea genus Candidatus Nitrososphaera, nitrite oxidizing bacteria in genus Nitrospira, and nitrate- and nitrite-dependent anaerobic methane oxidizing organisms in the archaeal family “ANME-2d” and bacterial phylum “NC10”, respectively. Nitrosomonadaceae (0.9-fold (p {\textless} 0.001)) increased with mussels, while NC10 (2.1-fold (p {\textless} 0.001)), ANME-2d (1.8-fold (p {\textless} 0.001)), and Candidatus Nitrososphaera (1.5-fold (p {\textless} 0.001)) decreased with mussels. Co-occurrence of 2-fold increases in Candidatus Brocadia and Nitrospira in shallow sediments suggests that mussels may enhance microbial niches at the interface of oxic–anoxic conditions, presumably through biodeposition and burrowing. Furthermore, it is likely that the niches of Candidatus Nitrososphaera and nitrite- and nitrate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidizers were suppressed by mussel biodeposition and sediment aeration, as these phylotypes require low ammonium concentrations and anoxic conditions, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first study to characterize freshwater mussel impacts on microbial diversity and the vertical distribution of N-cycle microorganisms in upper Mississippi river sediment. These findings advance our understanding of ecosystem services provided by mussels and their impact on aquatic biogeochemical N-cycling.},

	abstract = {Fish communities can support or hinder water quality management. Sulejów Reservoir, which is situated on the Pilica River in Central Poland, serves as a strategic reserve of drinking water for the Łódź Agglomeration. Precise knowledge of the long-term dynamics of the structure of the fish community, what was the aim of this study, is important for proper management to slow the eutrophication of the reservoir and prevent toxic algal blooms. To determine fish species composition, multimesh gill nets with mesh sizes ranging from 11 to 80 mm were used. From 1993 to 2015, gillnetting was conducted 1-2 times per month from June through November in two representative parts of the reservoir, and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to explore the temporal variation in fish community structure expressed as the relative contribution of each species to the total fish biomass. Dominance fluctuated among four species in the fish community: common bream, Abramis brama (Linnaeus, 1758); roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758); white bream, Blicca bjoerkna (Linnaeus, 1758); and pike-perch, Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758). PCA revealed three principal components with eigenvalues larger than one that explained 73.3\% of the observed variance in the temporal changes in fish community composition. A negative correlation was found between pike-perch biomass and roach biomass (r = 0.82), while a positive correlation was observed between the biomass of pike-perch and that of common bream (r = 0.73). Consequently, there was a highly negative correlation between the biomasses of common bream and roach (r = 0.80). Furthermore, an interesting temporal pattern was observed; from 1993 to 2000, the fish community was dominated by common bream and pike-perch but then shifted towards domination by roach and white bream, despite declining phosphorous and carbon concentrations. Recently, this trend has been reversed, and a more balanced fish community structure has been established. Fish community succession, which is usually reported to be a one-directional process in reservoirs, i.e., from a riverine fish or percid-dominated to a cyprinid (bream)-dominated state, was more ambiguous in Sulejów Reservoir. This was likely a consequence of both restoration issues related to decreasing nutrient loads and the influence of zebra mussel, Dreissenapolymorpha invasion on the trophic relations in the reservoir.},

	abstract = {Mytilopsis leucophaeata (Conrad, 1831) is native to the western Atlantic coast of North America. It has been reported in many regions outside its home range, including the Gulf of Gdańsk (the southern Baltic Sea). Although the conditions in the area seem to be favorable for the species, there have been no reports about its presence elsewhere in the gulf. However, the data probably did not reflect its actual distribution in the region, as the species can be easily misidentified for other bivalves living in the area, and it prefers hard substrates, which have not been studied as extensively as soft substrates. Our study was aimed at determining the actual distribution of M. leucophaeata in the Gulf of Gdańsk, the Vistula Delta and the Vistula Lagoon. The results showed that the species was not widely distributed in the Gulf of Gdańsk and was absent in the Vistula Lagoon. The only new records come from the Vistula Delta where the abundance of M. leucophaeata was up to 69 ind. m-2, i.e. significantly higher than in the Gulf of Gdańsk. Individuals found in the Vistula Delta were also significantly larger, with the length of shells reaching 22-23 mm, which is considered to be the maximum for the species.},

	abstract = {Describing and monitoring biodiversity comprise integral parts of ecosystem management. Recent research coupling metabarcoding and environmental DNA (eDNA) demonstrate that these methods can serve as important tools for surveying biodiversity, while significantly decreasing the time, expense and resources spent on traditional survey methods. The literature emphasizes the importance of genetic marker development, as the markers dictate the applicability, sensitivity and resolution ability of an eDNA assay. The present study developed two metabarcoding eDNA assays using the mtDNA 16S RNA gene with Illumina MiSeq platform to detect invertebrate fauna in the Laurentian Great Lakes and surrounding waterways, with a focus for use on invasive bivalve and gastropod species monitoring. We employed careful primer design and in vitro testing with mock communities to assess ability of the markers to amplify and sequence targeted species DNA, while retaining rank abundance information. In our mock communities, read abundances reflected the initial input abundance, with regressions having significant slopes (p{\textless}0.05) and high coefficients of determination (R2) for all comparisons. Tests on field environmental samples revealed similar ability of our markers to measure relative abundance. Due to the limited reference sequence data available for these invertebrate species, care must be taken when analyzing results and identifying sequence reads to species level. These markers extend eDNA metabarcoding research for molluscs and appear relevant to other invertebrate taxa, such as rotifers and bryozoans. Furthermore, the sphaeriid mussel assay is group-specific, exclusively amplifying bivalves in the Sphaeridae family and providing species-level identification. Our assays provide useful tools for managers and conservation scientists, facilitating early detection of invasive species as well as improving resolution of mollusc diversity.},

	abstract = {Invasive species continue to pose major challenges for managing coupled human–environmental systems. Predictive tools are essential to maximize invasion monitoring and conservation efforts in regions reliant on abundant freshwater resources to sustain economic welfare, social equity, and ecological services. Past studies have revealed biotic and abiotic heterogeneity, along with human activity, can account for much of the spatial variability of aquatic invaders; however, improvements remain. This study was created to (1) examine the distribution of aquatic invasive species richness (AISR) across 126 lakes in the Adirondack Region of New York; (2) develop and compare global and local models between lake and landscape characteristics and AISR; and (3) use geographically weighted regression (GWR) to evaluate non‐stationarity of local relationships, and assess its use for prioritizing lakes at risk to invasion. The evaluation index, AISR, was calculated by summing the following potential aquatic invaders for each lake: Asian Clam (Corbicula fluminea), Brittle Naiad (Najas minor), Curly‐leaf Pondweed (Potamogeton crispus), Eurasian Watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum), European Frog‐bit (Hydrocharis morsus‐ranae), Fanwort (Cabomba caroliniana), Spiny Waterflea (Bythotrephes longimanus), Variable‐leaf Milfoil (Myriophyllum heterophyllum), Water Chestnut (Trapa natans), Yellow Floating Heart (Nymphoides peltata), and Zebra Mussel (Dreissena polymorpha). The Getis‐Ord Gi* statistic displayed significant spatial hot and cold spots of AISR across Adirondack lakes. Spearman's rank (ρ) correlation coefficient test (rs) revealed urban land cover composition, lake elevation, relative patch richness, and abundance of game fish were the strongest predictors of aquatic invasion. Five multiple regression global Poisson and GWR models were made, with GWR fitting AISR very well (R2 = 76–83\%). Local pseudo‐t‐statistics of key explanatory variables were mapped and related to AISR, confirming the importance of GWR for understanding spatial relationships of invasion. The top 20 lakes at risk to future invasion were identified and ranked by summing the five GWR predictive estimates. The results inform that inexpensive and publicly accessible lake and landscape data, typically available from digital repositories within local environmental agencies, can be used to develop predictions of aquatic invasion with remarkable agreement. Ultimately, this transferable modeling approach can improve monitoring and management strategies for slowing the spread of invading species.},

Once aquatic invasive species are introduced, eradication may be difficult without adversely affecting native species and habitats, urging resource managers to find preventative methods to protect non-invaded areas. The use of ozone (O3) as a non-physical barrier has shown promise as it is lethal to a wide range of aquatic taxa, requires a short contact time, and is relatively environmentally safe in aquatic systems when compared to other chemicals. However, before O3 can be considered as an approach to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species, its effects on non-target organisms and already established aquatic invasive species must be fully evaluated. A review of the current literature was conducted to summarize data regarding the effects of O3 on aquatic taxa including fish, macroinvertebrates, zooplankton, phytoplankton, microbes, and pathogens. In addition, we assessed the practicality of ozone applications to control the movement of aquatic invasive species, and identified data gaps concerning the use of O3 as a non-physical barrier in field applications.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) are considered an important threat to global biodiversity due to major ecological impacts. In 2014, the European Union (EU) introduced a regulation (EU) No 1143/2014 on the prevention and management of the introduction and spread of IAS. The first risk prioritized list of IAS of EU concern was adopted on the 3rd of August 2016. EU member states are required within 18 months to carry out a comprehensive analysis and prioritisation of the pathways of unintentional introduction and spread of these IAS in their territory. Horizon-scanning is a method of IAS prioritisation through the systematic analysis of potential future IAS and identification of new opportunities for IAS management. However, horizon-scanning has mostly been applied on a national basis only, leading to a fragmented approach within the EU and ignoring the potential for IAS to cross international borders. We present a novel framework for horizon-scanning applicable at a continental scale. Our method maximises the use of available data from climatically matched countries by applying a harmonisation and aggregation method, and elucidates the relationship between pathways, impact types and species groups for risk prioritised IAS. Application of the method produced a list of potential IAS for the Netherlands revealing that the international trade in plants and animals is the most important pathway for the introduction of IAS. The horizon-scanning provided a starting point for the design of preventative, early identification and rapid action measures for the effective management of potential IAS.},

	abstract = {A thorough assessment of aquatic nonindigenous species’ risk facilitates successful monitoring and prevention activities. However, species- and vector-specific information is often limited and difficult to synthesize across a single risk framework. To address this need, we developed an assessment framework capable of estimating the potential for introduction, establishment, and impact by aquatic nonindigenous species from diverse spatial origins and taxonomic classification, in novel environments. Our model builds on previous approaches, while taking on a new perspective for evaluation across species, vectors and stages to overcome the limitations imposed by single species and single vector assessments. We applied this globally-relevant framework to the Laurentian Great Lakes to determine its ability to evaluate risk across multiple taxa and vectors. This case study included 67 aquatic species, identified as “watchlist species” in NOAA’s Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Information System (GLANSIS). Vectors included shipping, hitchhiking/fouling, unauthorized intentional release, escape from recreational or commercial culture, and natural dispersal. We identified potential invaders from every continent but Africa and Antarctica. Of the 67 species, more than a fifth (21\%) had a high potential for introduction and greater than 60\% had a moderate potential for introduction. Shipping (72\%) was the most common potential vector of introduction, followed by unauthorized intentional release (25\%), hitchhiking/fouling (21\%), dispersal (19\%), stocking/planting/escape from recreational culture (13\%), and escape from commercial culture. The ability to assess a variety of aquatic nonindigenous species from an array of potential vectors using a consistent methodology is essential for comparing likelihoods of introduction, establishment, and impact. The straightforward design of this framework will allow its application and modification according to policy priorities by natural resource managers. The ability to use a variety of information sources facilitates completion of assessments despite the paucity of data that often plagues aquatic nonindigenous species management.},

	abstract = {Native to the central USA, the Blue Catfish Ictalurus furcatus and the Flathead Catfish Pylodictis olivaris have been widely introduced into many Atlantic slope rivers and are now found in several drainages of the Chesapeake Bay. Fisheries managers are concerned that these large, long‐lived catfish species may be contributing to observed declines in anadromous species, such as the American Shad Alosa sapidissima, Blueback Herring A. aestivalis, and Alewife A. pseudoharengus, all of which once comprised major U.S. fisheries. We assessed spatiotemporal variability and selectivity in the diets of Blue Catfish and Flathead Catfish during the spawning migration of these alosines. Catfish stomachs were collected during March–May in nontidal freshwater, tidal freshwater, oligohaline, and mesohaline portions of the James River. Diet contents were extracted from 2,495 catfish, 69.86\% of which had prey items present in their foreguts (N = 1,743). We used DNA barcoding to identify degraded fish prey; nearly 30 taxa that would have otherwise gone undetected were identified in this manner. Blue Catfish had broad, omnivorous diets, whereas Flathead Catfish fed solely on other fish. Alosines were found in 4.46\% of Blue Catfish stomachs and 16.67\% of Flathead Catfish stomachs. Flathead Catfish selectively preyed on American Shad and, to a lesser degree, river herring. Alosines were consumed more frequently in nontidal freshwater areas, particularly in the high‐gradient reach between Bosher Dam and the 14th Street Bridge, and predation on alosines peaked in April. Our results suggest that Flathead Catfish are likely to have a greater per capita impact on depleted alosines. Furthermore, dams and other obstacles to fish movement may increase alosines’ vulnerability to predation by large catfish.},

	abstract = {Ballast water discharge is a major source of nonindigenous species (NIS) introductions globally and in Canadian waters. This water is carried in ballast tanks of ships loaded with little or no cargo, where surviving organisms may be released in new environments upon deballasting. Arctic economic development and consequential rise in marine traffic, combined with sea ice reduction, may increase the risks of introductions over the long term. Ballast water exchange (BWE) regulations, under the Canada Shipping Act, were designed to limit NIS introductions in Canadian waters by international vessels, which are required to conduct mid-ocean ballast water exchange. However, domestic ships, navigating exclusively within Canadian waters, are currently exempt from these regulations. Here, we assessed the potential risks of NIS introduction to the Eastern Arctic by quantifying species density and diversity of mesozooplankton (MZP) in ballast water carried by a domestic ship, the M/V Arctic, which regularly transits between Quebec Cityand Deception Bay (QC). Evaluation of two voluntary BWE zones in Jacques Cartier Strait and Strait of Belle Isle revealed lower efficacy in reducing MZP density compared to unexchanged (control) water ballasted in Quebec City. In the unexchanged ballast watertanks, the MZP community experienced high mortality due to increasing ballast water age. However, species composition in exchanged tanks was similar to the community of the port of destination (Deception Bay), whereas unexchanged tanks transported higher densities of NIS. Data obtained through this study will provide basic information on NIS transport to the Arctic and contribute to the revision of regulations.},

	abstract = {The surveillance and control of introduced species has become an increasingly important, yet often controversial, form of environmental management. I investigate why and how introduced species management is initiated; whether, why and how it is contested; and what relations and outcomes emerge ‘in practice’. I examine how introduced species management is being done in the United Kingdom through detailed social scientific analyses of the processes, practices, and disputes involved in a series of management case studies.First, I demonstrate how some established approaches to the design and delivery of management initiatives can render them conflict-prone, ineffective and potentially unjust. Then, examining a dispute surrounding a state-initiated eradication of monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), I show why and how ‘parakeet protectors’ opposed the initiative. I identify the significance of divergent evaluations of the risks posed by introduced wildlife; personal and community attachments between people and parakeets; and campaigners’ dissatisfaction with central government’s approach to the issue. By following the story of an unauthorised (re)introduction of Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) to England, I show how a diverse collective has, at least temporarily, been united and empowered by a shared understanding of beavers as ‘belonging’ in the UK. I consider how nonhuman citizenship is socio-politically negotiated, and how the beavers have become enrolled in a ‘wild experiment’. Finally, through a multisited study of grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) control initiatives, I find important variations in management practitioners’ approaches to killing squirrels, and identify several ‘modes of killing’ that comprise different primary motivations, moral principles, ultimate aims, and practical methods.I identify multiple ways in which people respond and relate to introduced wildlife, and demonstrate how this multiplicity produces both socio-political tensions and accords. Furthermore, throughout this thesis I make a series of propositions for re-configuring the management of introduced species in ways that explicitly incorporate inclusive, constructive, and context-appropriate socio-political deliberations into its design and implementation.},

	abstract = {Oriental Weatherfish (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus ), native to Southeast Asia, are freshwater fish belonging to the family Cobitidae (loaches). They are benthic fish with the ability to breathe atmospheric air, and exhibit an unusual behavior of swimming vertically in the water column in response to changes in barometric pressure. Oriental Weatherfish appear to be successful invaders to North American waterways. Within the last century they have been sighted in freshwater systems throughout the United States, yet the distribution and source of this invasion are largely unknown. This study investigates the distribution patterns, surveying methods, and population genetics of the Oriental Weatherfish within Illinois and Indiana waterways. These data were collected in 2013 and 2014 and supplemented with publically available data to provide the most up-to-date map of the current distribution in Illinois (IL) and Indiana (IN). Catch rates were calculated and compared across gear types and sampling sites to assess different survey methods. Sequence data from cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and the control region (D-Loop) were compared among specimens collected from multiple sites throughout IL and IN with those available on GenBank. Results from this study suggest a single introduction to IL and IN before 1987, with a subsequent range expansion. This study is the first to genetically examine this weatherfish population. Data suggest that the population is genetically identical to the weatherfish introduced into Australia before 1984, and that these populations were derived from the same native population in Asia.},

	abstract = {This dissertation links human and ecological systems research to analyze resource management decisions for elodea, Alaska’s first submerged aquatic invasive plant. The plant likely made it to Alaska through the aquarium trade. It was first discovered in urban parts of the state but is being introduced to remote water bodies by floatplanes and other pathways. Once introduced, elodea changes freshwater systems in ways that can threaten salmon and make floatplane destinations inaccessible. The analysis integrates multiple social and ecological data to estimate the potential future economic loss associated with its introduction to salmon fisheries and floatplane pilots. For estimating the effects on commercial sockeye fisheries, multiple methods of expert elicitation are used to quantify and validate expert opinion about elodea’s ecological effects on salmon. These effects are believed to most likely be negative, but can in some instances be positive. Combined with market-based economic valuation, the approach accounts for the full range of potential ecological and economic effects. For analyzing the lost trip values to floatplane pilots, the analysis uses contingent valuation to estimate recreation demand for landing spots. A spatially-explicit model consisting of seven regions simulates elodea’s spread across Alaska and its erratic population dynamics. This simulation model accounts for the change in region-specific colonization rates as elodea populations are eradicated. The most probable economic loss to commercial fisheries and recreational floatplane pilots is \$97 million per year, with a 5\% chance that combined losses exceed \$456 million annually. The analysis describes how loss varies among stakeholders and regions, with more than half of statewide loss accruing to commercial sockeye salmon fisheries in Bristol Bay. Upfront management of all existing invasions is found to be the optimal management strategy for minimizing long-term loss. Even though the range of future economic loss is large, the certainty of long-term damage favors investments to eradicate current invasions and prevent new arrivals. The study serves as a step toward risk management aimed at protecting productive ecosystems of national and global significance.},

	abstract = {The energy needs of rorqual whales (f. Balaenopteridae) govern their relationship to marine habitats during the foraging season. However, their cryptic foraging strategies and extreme feeding behaviors complicate our effort to identify and protect habitats “critical” for rorquals. What is the relationship between rorquals and their habitat, and how must that shape conservation strategies? I addressed this question in the case of sympatric humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and fin whales ( Balaenoptera physalus) in the marine territory of the Gitga’at First Nation in the Kitimat Fjord System of British Columbia. For three summers (2013-2015) I studied whales, their prey, and their environment aboard the  RV Bangarang using oceanographic station sampling, systematic transect surveys, and opportunistic focal follows of whales (Chapter 1). Ocean sampling demonstrated the strong coupling of water features with offshore patterns in storm forcing and regional meteorology (Chapter 2). By combining these surveys with a long-term Gitga’at dataset, area humpback whales were found to practice a structured and persistent pattern in seasonal habitat use, which demonstrates how complex and habitat-specific a rorqual’s habitat use can be (Chapter 3). Both humpback and fin whales were found to respond to changes in krill supply in aggregative and behavioral thresholds that are set by a combination of intrinsic energetic needs and the context of local prey supply (Chapter 4). Associations with non-prey habitat features were markedly different in the two species (Chapter 5). Humpback distribution was more closely coupled to that of their prey and other habitat features, while fin whale distribution was driven broadly by site fidelity. Novel spatial analytics were used to identify the most probable environmental cues used by foraging whales (Chapter 6). Both species were found to be particularly sensitive to the depth of prey layers, which is governed largely by oceanographic features (Chapter 7). This coupling of habitat features and feeding performance influences the competitive dynamics of rorqual whales. The findings in this case study advance general theories on marine predator ecology and conservation, and have direct implications for the management of Gitga’at territory and the identification of fin whale critical habitat in Pacific Canada.},

Genus Congeria is a Tertiary relict that comprises three species from Dinaric karst area; C. kusceri, C. jalzici and C. mulaomerovici, each with very limited distribution. They are the only known cave bivalves and in contrast to many other cave species, they form populations with high densities. We estimated that the population of C. kusceri in Jama u Predolcu is between 72,454 and 72,906 individuals. The highest density occurred between one and three meters depth, and reached maximum of 1,625 individuals per square meter. Here we also present the results of a two-year water temperature and water level survey in several C. kusceri and C. jalzici localities. Data loggers showed that C. jalzici occurs in colder caves and higher water level oscillations then C. kusceri. From our data, it is obvious that the natural hydrological conditions in Congeria habitats were seriously altered. This and a series of other threats led to Congeria species being highly endangered. During low water levels, a part of the bivalve population becomes exposed to air in most localities. Uniquely, they are active during that period and are able to survive those conditions for more than 2 months.},

	abstract = {The success of Limnoperna fortunei as an invasive species is related to its physiological plasticity that allows them to endure adverse environmental conditions. Starvation tolerance is considered to be an important trait associated with bivalve invasiveness. In natural ecosystems, food resources can vary during the year, exposing mussels to variable periods of starvation or limited food availability. Thus, mussels have developed physiological strategies to tolerate and survive fluctuations in food availability. Glycogen concentration has been used in different monitoring studies as an indicator of the nutritional condition of bivalves. The aim of this study was to investigate the physiological responses of L. fortunei based on the glycogen concentrations of specimens under four treatments, comprising different combinations of feeding and starvation, during 125 days. The experiment was carried out in two phases. In the phase I, mussels were divided in two treatments: starvation (S) and feeding (F). After 100 days, tissue samples were collected to quantify glycogen concentrations and, each phase I group was divided in two subgroups: starvation (S) and feeding (F), resulting in four treatments. In the phase II, that lasted 25 days, starvation specimens (S) from phase I were allowed to feed (starvation-feeding treatment , or S-F), or continued to undergo starvation (starvation-starvation treatment , or S-S) and the feeding specimens (F) continued feeding (feeding-feeding group, or F-F), or were subjected to starvation (feeding-starvation treatment , or F-S). Behavior (valve-closing) and mortality were recorded in 24 h intervals. After the 25 days (phase II) all specimens were killed, and their soft tissue was removed to quantify glycogen concentrations. The glycogen concentration of the S-F treatment was lower than that of the F-S treatment, which was initially allowed to feed (phase I) and then subjected to starvation (phase II). Stability in the glycogen concentrations was observed when the phase II feeding conditions were maintained during the experiments, as observed in the S-S (continued starvation) and F-F (continued feeding) treatments. Based on our glycogen concentrations results, the golden mussel shows a higher tolerance to starvation (125 days) than has previously been published, which suggests that its tolerance strongly influences its invasive behavior.},

	abstract = {Assessments of the impact of construction, operation and removal of large infrastructures and other human activities on the marine environment are limited because they do not fully quantify the background baseline conditions and relevant scales of natural variability. Baselines as defined in Environmental Impact Assessments typically reflect the status of the environment and its variability drawn from published literature and augmented with some short term site specific characterization. Consequently, it can be difficult to determine whether a change in the environment subsequent to industrial activity is within or outside the range of natural background variability representative of an area over decades or centuries. An innovative approach that shows some promise in overcoming the limitations of traditional baseline monitoring methodology involves the analysis of shell material (sclerochronology) from molluscs living upon or within the seabed in potentially affected areas. Bivalves especially can be effective biomonitors of their environment over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. A rapidly expanding body of research has established that numerous characteristics of the environment can be reflected in morphological and geochemical properties of the carbonate shell material in bivalve shells, as well as in functional responses such as growth rates. In addition, the annual banding pattern in shells can provide an absolute chronometer of environmental variability and/or industrial effects. Further, some species of very long-lived bivalves can be crossdated back in time, like trees, by comparing the annual banding patterns in their shells. It is therefore feasible to develop extended timeseries of certain marine environmental variables that can provide important insights into long temporal scales of baseline variability. We review recent innovative work on the shell structure, morphology and geochemistry of bivalves and conclude that they have substantial potential for use as monitors of environmental variability and the effects of pollutants and disturbance.},

	abstract = {Human activities, both established and emerging, increasingly affect the provision of marine ecosystem services that deliver societal and economic benefits. Monitoring the status of marine ecosystems and determining how human activities change their capacity to sustain benefits for society requires an evidence-based Integrated Ecosystem Assessment approach that incorporates knowledge of ecosystem functioning and services). Although there are diverse methods to assess the status of individual ecosystem components, none assesses the health of marine ecosystems holistically, integrating information from multiple ecosystem components. Similarly, while acknowledging the availability of several methods to measure single pressures and assess their impacts, evaluation of cumulative effects of multiple pressures remains scarce. Therefore, an integrative assessment requires us to first understand the response of marine ecosystems to human activities and their pressures and then develop innovative, cost-effective monitoring tools that enable collection of data to assess the health status of large marine areas. Conceptually, combining this knowledge of effective monitoring methods with cost-benefit analyses will help identify appropriate management measures to improve environmental status economically and efficiently. The European project DEVOTES (DEVelopment Of innovative Tools for understanding marine biodiversity and assessing good Environmental Status) specifically addressed these topics in order to support policy makers and managers in implementing the European Marine Strategy Framework Directive. Here, we synthesize our main innovative findings, placing these within the context of recent wider research, and identifying gaps and the major future challenges.},

	abstract = {This study assessed the efficacy of commercially available descalers and factors that influence their efficacy as tools for marine biosecurity management. Laboratory experiments found calcium carbonate (CaCO3) degradation varied up to 29\% (from 111 to 143 g/l) amongst seven products tested. Increasing the concentration of hydrochloric, phosphoric and acid-surfactant descalers from 25 to 75\% did not increase the rate or total degradation of the mussel, Mytilus planulatus. Warming descaling solutions (from 11 to 26°C) significantly increased the rate of mussel mortality, decay and total degradation in all treatments. Circulating treatments increased mussel mortality and decay rate in hydrochloric and acid-surfactant descalers, but had no detectable effect on total degradation after 24h. Hydrochloric acid based descalers (Rydlyme®, 3H® and Dynamic Descaler®) were more effective than phosphoric acid (Barnacle Buster®) and acid-surfactant (Triple 7 Enviroscale Plus®) treatments. Organic material was largely resistant to degradation under all treatments. The implications for descalers as marine biosecurity tools are discussed.},

	abstract = {Zequanox® is a commercial formulation of the killed bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens (strain CL145A), that was developed to control dreissenid mussels. In 2014, Zequanox became the second product registered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) for use in open water environments as a molluscicide. Previous nontarget studies demonstrated the safety and selectivity of P. fluorescens CL154A, but the database on the toxicity of the formulation (Zequanox) is limited for macroinvertebrate taxa and exposure conditions. We evaluated the safety of Zequanox to the amphipod Gammarus lacustris lacustris, and nymphs of the burrowing mayfly, Hexagenia spp. at the maximum approved concentration (100 mg/L active ingredient, A.I.) and exposure duration (8 h). Survival of animals was assessed after 8 h of exposure and again at 24 and 96 h post-exposure. Histopathology of the digestive tract of control and treated animals was compared at 96 h post-exposure. The results showed no significant effect of Zequanox on survival of either species. Survival of G. lacustris exceeded 85\% in all concentrations at all three sampling time points. Survival of Hexagenia spp. ranged from 71\% (control) to 91\% at 8 h, 89–93\% at 24 h post-exposure, and 70–73\% at 96 h post-exposure across all treatments. We saw no evidence of pathology in the visceral organs of treated animals. Our results indicate that application of Zequanox at the maximum approved concentration and exposure duration did not cause significant mortality or treatment-related histopathological changes to G. lacustris and Hexagenia spp.},

Increasing globalization facilitates IAS arrival, and environmental changes, including climate change, facilitate IAS establishment. Here we provide the first global, spatial analysis of the terrestrial threat from IAS in light of twenty-first century globalization and environmental change, and evaluate national capacities to prevent and manage species invasions. We find that one-sixth of the global land surface is highly vulnerable to invasion, including substantial areas in developing economies and biodiversity hotspots. The dominant invasion vectors differ between high-income countries (imports, particularly of plants and pets) and low-income countries (air travel). Uniting data on the causes of introduction and establishment can improve early-warning and eradication schemes. Most countries have limited capacity to act against invasions. In particular, we reveal a clear need for proactive invasion strategies in areas with high poverty levels, high biodiversity and low historical levels of invasion.},

	abstract = {The ornamental pet trade is often considered a key culprit for conservation problems such as the introduction of invasive species (including infectious diseases) and overharvesting of rare species. Here, we present the first assessment of the biodiversity of freshwater molluscs in the ornamental pet trade in Singapore, one of the most important global hubs of the ornamental aquarium trade, and discuss associated conservation concerns. We recorded freshwater molluscs from ornamental pet shops and major exporters including non-ornamental species (e.g., hitchhikers, molluscs sold as fish feed). We recorded an unexpectedly high diversity—59 species—of freshwater bivalves and gastropods, with the majority (38 species or 64\%) being from the Oriental region. In addition to morphological examination, we sequenced the DNA barcode region of mitochondrial CO1 and 16S genes to provide molecular data for the confirmation of the identification and for future re-identification. DNA barcodes were obtained for 50 species, and all but four were separated by {\textgreater} 3\% uncorrected pairwise distances. The trade has been considered a main introduction pathway for non-native species to Singapore, and we found that out of 15 species in the trade as well as in the wild in Singapore, 12 are either introduced or of unknown origin, representing almost half of the known non-native freshwater molluscs in Singapore. Particularly prevalent are non-ornamental species: six hitchhikers on aquarium plants and six species sold as fish feed. We found that a quarter of the trade species have a history of introduction, which includes 11 known or potentially invasive species. We conclude that potential overharvesting is difficult to assess because only half of the trade species have been treated by IUCN. Of these, 21 species are of Least Concern and three are Data Deficient. Our checklist, with accompanying DNA barcodes, images, and museum vouchers, provides an important reference library for future monitoring, and constitutes a step toward creating a more sustainable ornamental pet trade.},

	abstract = {"The group here around the lake formed a plan," [Doug Curtis] said. "No, it wasn't a concrete plan, no, it probably wasn't the best plan, but it was a plan. We had a gate on the boat launch so that before anybody could get on the boat launch they had to contact somebody with a key and we would deal with that. We went so far as to buy a \$5,000 pressure washer. Apparently, one of the ways to eliminate the zebra mussels off the boat is 90 C water. And so we went that route."              "We have a lot of individuals around the lake who are nurses, who are police officers, firefighters who work shift work. If they don't have the ability to see the access on Tuesdays or Wednesdays and Thursdays when they don't have to work, making it just for weekends for a few hours, and saying, 'You can only go at this time of day on a Saturday and this time on a Sunday to put a boat in and then at this time of year to take the boat out,' it isn't reasonable."              "At this point it does feel around the lake very much like (lake)front versus back lot, which is unfortunate," he said. "It's really dividing the community. Everyone really cares about the environment of our lake. We all know whether you're front lot or back lot, if there are zebra mussels in it, all of our property values are going to drop significantly and all the value we have in those properties is going to be gone. We don't want to see anything bad happen, but the assumption right now that you can trust a lake-front property owner to make sure their friends aren't going in the water with infected boats, but you can't trust the back-lot to do that is really hard to understand and hard to not create separation and issues within the community."},

	abstract = {The zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha is a well-established invasive model organism. Although extensively used in environmental sciences, virtually nothing is known of the molecular process of its shell calcification. By describing the microstructure, geochemistry and biochemistry/proteomics of the shell, the present study aims at promoting this species as a model organism in biomineralization studies, in order to establish a bridge with ecotoxicology, while sketching evolutionary conclusions. The shell of D. polymorpha exhibits the classical crossed-lamellar/complex crossed lamellar combination found in several heterodont bivalves, in addition to an external thin layer, the characteristics of which differ from what was described in earlier publication. We show that the shell selectively concentrates some heavy metals, in particular uranium, which predisposes D. polymorpha to local bioremediation of this pollutant. We establish the biochemical signature of the shell matrix, demonstrating that it interacts with the in vitro precipitation of calcium carbonate and inhibits calcium carbonate crystal formation, but these two properties are not strongly expressed. This matrix, although overall weakly glycosylated, contains a set of putatively calcium-binding proteins and a set of acidic sulphated proteins. 2D-gels reveal more than fifty proteins, twenty of which we identify by MS-MS analysis. We tentatively link the shell protein profile of D. polymorpha and the peculiar recent evolution of this invasive species of Ponto-Caspian origin, which has spread all across Europe in the last three centuries.},

Plethodon cinereus population declines have been associated with leaf litter loss following the invasion of several exotic earthworm species, but there have been few studies on the specific interactions between pheretimoid earthworms and P. cinereus. Since some species of large and active pheretimoids spatially overlap with salamanders beneath natural cover objects and in detritus, they may distinctively compound the negative consequences of earthworm-mediated resource degradation by physically disturbing important salamander activities (foraging, mating, and egg brooding). We predicted that earthworms would exclude salamanders from high quality microhabitat, reduce foraging efficiency, and negatively affect salamander fitness. In laboratory trials, salamanders used lower quality microhabitat and consumed fewer flies in the presence of earthworms. In a natural field experiment, conducted on salamander populations from “non-invaded” and “pheretimoid invaded” sites in Ohio, salamanders and earthworms shared cover objects {\textasciitilde}60\% less than expected. Earthworm abundance was negatively associated with juvenile and male salamander abundance, but had no relationship with female salamander abundance. There was no effect of pheretimoid invasion on salamander body condition. Juvenile and non-resident male salamanders do not hold stable territories centered beneath cover objects such as rocks or logs, which results in reduced access to prey, greater risk of desiccation, and dispersal pressure. Habitat degradation and physical exclusion of salamanders from cover objects may hinder juvenile and male salamander performance, ultimately reducing recruitment and salamander abundance following Asian earthworm invasion.},

Species composition as well as the abundance and biomass were examined at various sites. An inactive World War II torpedo testing facility in the Gulf of Gdansk served as a site for sampling long-term communities while short-term communities were sampled using settlement panels and PVC cylinders. Panels were deployed at the torpedo testing facility for 127 days. PVC cylinders were deployed for 141-190 days in the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone. Twenty six macrofaunal taxa, including 12 crustaceans, were identified during the research. Mytilus edulis and Amphibalanus improvisus were the most abundant invertebrates at sampled surfaces. Six non-indigenous species were found. For the first time adult individuals of Mytilopsis leucophaeata were found in the Polish Marine Areas indicating that it is possible for this non-indigenous species to reproduce in this region.},

	abstract = {Modern river ecosystems undergo constant stress from disturbances such as bank stabilization, channelization, dams, and municipal, agricultural, and industrial water use. As these anthropogenic water requirements persist, more efficient methods of characterizing river reaches are essential. Benthic macroinvertebrates are helpful when evaluating fluvial health, because they are often the first group to react to contaminants that can then be transferred through them to other trophic levels. Hence, the purpose of this research is to use a geospatial model to differentiate instream macroinvertebrate habitats, and determine if the model is a viable method for stream evaluation. Through the use of ArcGIS and digital elevation models, the fluvial geomorphology of the Qu’Appelle River in Saskatchewan (SK) was assessed. Four geomorphological characteristics of the river were isolated (sinuosity, slope, fractal dimension, and stream width) and clustered through Principle Component Analysis (PCA), yielding sets of river reaches with similar geomorphological characteristics, called typologies. These typologies were mapped to form a geospatial model of the river. Macroinvertebrate data were aligned to the locations of the typologies, revealing several relationships with the fluvial geomorphology. A Kruskal-Wallis analysis and post hoc pairwise multiple comparisons were completed with the macroinvertebrate data to pinpoint significant genera, as related to the geospatial model.},

	abstract = {Invasion ecology has been a growing discipline in recent decades, with good reason, as the consequence of nonnative invasive species thriving outside of their native ranges can be extremely detrimental ecologically and economically. Biological Invasions in Changing Ecosystems covers the topic logically with sections on the pathways, impacts and management of invasions, as well as future directions. Contributions from over 50 scientists provide a neat snapshot of current understanding through expert discussion and case studies. These cover a variety of topics, albeit with an emphasis on aquatic systems, including an interesting account of the history of avian invasions. Inevitably, writing style is a little inconsistent between authors but chapters are grouped well and each has a useful bulleted summary, making this an easy book in which to find and read about specific topics. The book is suited to people studying biology, who are the primary intended audience. Possibly the greatest positive of this book is the openaccess publishing (of the digital copy), which benefits those students who may be based in countries or institutions without endless resources, as well as any interested individual who takes a professional or personal interest in biological invasions and wants to understand more. Sometimes the difficulty with books like this is that there is no real synthesis, tying together all the chapters from different authors. Nonetheless, there are some clear messages that come through when reading, such as the dynamic nature of the field (hence the benefit of periodical books summarizing knowledge such as this) as well as invasions resulting from an indirect effect of our actions, as in the example of deer ked responding to managed moose populations in Scandinavia. The closing remarks of the final chapter I think do set the tone for one of the main messages. There is talk of the need for ‘reconciliation ecology’, whereby solutions are sought that integrate biodiversity into humandominated landscapes and acknowledge that return to pristine conditions is unlikely in many cases. While this may not sit well with more optimistic readers, it is an important point, that reducing the detrimental effects of non-native invasive species is often more likely to succeed when approached this way. In short, this book is a nice addition to the invasion ecology literature and, although not all of the chapters may be essential reading for everyone, J. Canning-Clode has done a good job to ensure that there is still a wide appeal. Gary Clewley, British Trust for Ornithology, Thetford, Norfolk, UK},

	abstract = {Climate change is causing alterations to marine ecosystems with ocean acidification (OA) and warming widely considered to be some of the most pervasive anthropogenic threats to global marine biodiversity. To date the majority of climate change studies using intertidal organisms neglect the inherent natural variability experienced within coastal ecosystems and the substantial periods of emersion encountered over daily tidal cycles, thus limiting our ability to extrapolate responses of coastal organisms to near-future conditions. This project investigates how a variable intertidal environment can influence acid-base responses to future climatic conditions in the ecologically and economically important bivalve species Mytilus edulis and Perumytilus purpuratus. Fieldwork is used to provide novel and much needed data on the natural environmental conditions experienced by two populations of M. edulis and one population of P. purpuratus along with the acid-base response over 12-hour tidal cycles. This data then helps to parameterise experimental work investigating the influence of size (37 – 50 mm and 60 – 79 mm shell length), temperature (7 °C, 13 °C, 20 °C, 28 °C) and low pH exposure (pH 7.7) as drivers of acid-base change during environmentally realistic (6 hour) immersion and emersion periods. I then investigate the potential for populations inhabiting upwelling regions to have an altered acid-base response to short-term exposures to elevated pCO2 levels. Finally, I investigate if a variable pH/ pCO2 regime will incur greater physiological costs than a stable pH/ pCO2 regime over 14 days. My results add to further evidence suggesting mussels have a limited ability to regulate acid-base disturbances during both short- and medium- term exposures to elevated seawater pCO2. In addition, populations inhabiting upwelling regions showed no significant difference in acid-base response suggesting a low adaptation potential in acid-base regulatory abilities. Furthermore, my results clearly demonstrate for the first time that size (shell length) and temperature are the predominant drivers of acid-base change during emersion and pH/ pCO2 during immersion. Elevations in temperature had an increasing influence on acid-base balance, with size playing a crucial role in moderating these disturbances at increasingly higher temperatures. Perhaps most interesting, this project found a clear energetic cost of pH/ pCO2 variability over 14 days, suggesting the use of stable pH values currently used in OA studies may not reliably inform predictions of future organism responses. With seawater pH/ pCO2variability expected to increase and intensify in addition to warming, sea level rise and other climatic changes, this work highlights the need to use environmentally realistic scenarios that reflect natural variability in order to predict future outcomes for marine biota.},

In addition to anthropogenic pollution, these organisms face significant variations in their habitat, which are likely to be amplified with climate change. Thus, it is important to study the influence of immersion time, salinity and a rise in temperature on the immune skills of bivalves. To do this, experiments took place both in the field and in the laboratory.

An improved understanding of reproductive strategies and life history traits is key in order to understand the spreading potential. The assessment of the magnitude and temporal dynamics of propagule pressure from the reproducing population important for the success of control actions and needs is to be determined prior to any field intervention. The reproductive cycle of three fouling bryozoans (Bugula neritina, Tricellaria inopinata and Virididentula dentata) in the waters of the Azores Archipelago was assessed. The study revealed that although the release of larvae can occur throughout the entire year, its intensity and developmental and the attachment success of the ancestrula are not even throughout the year and that each species’ reproductive development needs to be determine independently. In the light of these findings, it is possible to determine the best time to apply field actions aimed at controlling invasive population’s density levels, optimizing the always scarce financial resources for marine management.},

	abstract = {Nonindigenous species (NIS) are those that have been intentionally or unintentionally introduced outside of their native range as a consequence of human activity. If these species then threaten indigenous species and biodiversity, and/or cause economic damage, they are referred to as “invasive.” Biological invasions are not only one of the greatest threats to indigenous marine biodiversity, but they can also cause massive economic and ecological damage. Their presence could also lead to a water body failing to achieve good environmental status under the forthcoming EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive. As the rate of invasion to Great Britain and European waters continues to increase, particularly in light of climate change, the emphasis by member states is on prevention rather than on control or eradication an NIS once an invasive NIS has become established. This paper reviews NIS biosecurity planning for the marine environment, including the most current legislative background, pathway identification and highlights the main issues with the current risk assessment processes. The potential impacts of marine NIS, practical biosecurity measures from Great Britain and internationally are also reviewed. The aim of this paper is to draw attention to the challenges associated with preventing the introduction of marine NIS and to highlight the urgent need for concerted action across the EU member states and marine industries to produce robust biosecurity plans to protect indigenous species.},

Despite widespread use of timed-search methods to survey river mussels, the relationship between species detection and search effort has received limited study. In this study, repeat-sampling data from 54 Ontario river sites were used to estimate: (1) species detection probabilities; (2) the number of sampling events required to confidently detect species; and, (3) the power of timed-search surveys to detect future distribution declines. Mussels were collected using visual and tactile methods, and collection data were recorded separately for each 1.5 h of search time (up to 4.5 h). Thirteen species were collected; including two endangered species (Rainbow Villosa iris and Eastern Pondmussel Ligumia nasuta). In all cases, species detection was imperfect. However, detection probabilities (p) for most species were high ({\textgreater}0.69). Two repeat 4.5 h surveys are required to confidently assess whether most (83\%) species are present at a site. Search effort had a positive effect on estimates of species richness, detection probability and site occupancy, and the power to detect future distribution declines. At all levels of sampling effort, detection probability and site occupancy estimates were positively correlated to mussel abundance.

Dans cette étude, des données d’échantillonnage répété de 54 sites de rivière de l’Ontario ont été utilisées pour estimer : (1) les probabilités de détection de l’espèce; (2) le nombre d’événements d’échantillonnage requis pour détecter de façon fiable toute les espèces; et, (3) la puissance des échantillonnages chronométrés pour détecter de futures baisses de distribution.

	abstract = {Background              Worldwide freshwater ecosystems are increasingly affected by invasive alien species. In particular, Ponto-Caspian gobiid fishes and amphipods are suspected to have pronounced effects on aquatic food webs. However, there is a lack of systematic studies mechanistically testing the potential synergistic effects of invasive species on native fauna. In this study we investigated the interrelations between the invasive amphipod Dikerogammarus villosus and the invasive fish species Neogobius melanostomus in their effects on the native amphipod Gammarus pulex. We hypothesized selective predation by the fish as a driver for displacement of native species resulting in potential extinction of G. pulex. The survival of G. pulex in the presence of N. melanostomus in relation to the presence of D. villosus and availability of shelter was analyzed in the context of behavioural differences between the amphipod species.              Results              Gammarus pulex had a significantly higher susceptibility to predation by N. melanostomus compared to D. villosus in all experiments, suggesting preferential predation by this fish on native gammarids. Furthermore, the presence of D. villosus significantly increased the vulnerability of G. pulex to fish predation. Habitat structure was an important factor for swimming activity of amphipods and their mortality, resulting in a threefold decrease in amphipods consumed with shelter habitat structures provided. Behavioral differences in swimming activity were additionally responsible for higher predation rates on G. pulex. Intraguild predation could be neglected within short experimental durations.              Conclusions              The results of this study provide evidence for synergistic effects of the two invasive Ponto-Caspian species on the native amphipod as an underlying process of species displacements during invasion processes. Prey behaviour and monotonous habitat structures additionally contribute to the decline of the native gammarid fauna in the upper Danube River and elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Microcystin toxin is a known environmental stressor with implications for ecosystem harm throughout many inland waterways in California. This purported freshwater toxin has recently emerged in the marine environment in Monterey Bay. Microcystin abundance and frequency, as well as environmental variables that drive toxin production in the Monterey Bay area were examined by deploying Solid Phase Adsorption Toxin Tracking (SPATT) samplers and evaluating water samples for 3 years. Microcystin was found in 15 of 21 monitored sites and was shown to be correlated with anthropogenic nutrient loading. Because it is relevant to identify an indicator organism to better monitor this toxin, uptake and release of microcystin toxin in California mussels (Mytilus californianus), and commercial oysters (Crassostrea sp.) were also examined. To provide environmental relevancy Mytilus sp. were also collected at 4 sites in San Francisco Bay for 6 months and analyzed for microcystin toxin. The results indicate that mussels purge microcystin toxin slowly, while oysters released toxin more quickly, however, both have the ability to retain toxin for 8 weeks post-exposure. To investigate potential effects to marine and estuarine birds at upper trophic levels the use of Whatman ® FTA® blood sample collection cards were evaluated in tandem with competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and this method was shown to have utility for postmortem analysis and large die off events. Blood was also collected from birds admitted to rehabilitation in Monterey Bay between 2011–2015 and two groups of waterbirds tested positive for microcystin toxin. The extensive manifestation of microcystin in the Monterey Bay area exhibits the need for better monitoring and management of this toxin. Management decisions made at the terrestrial level, may now impact freshwater, estuarine, and marine ecosystems, particularly given the demonstrated capacity for bio-accumulation in shellfish. The identification of a potential bio-indicator through this study, could be used to inform the current Mussel Watch Program or could aid in establishing an analogous monitoring program specific to this toxin. Because current data on the effects of toxic algae on waterbirds is meager, this study addresses this deficiency by identifying a new technique for detecting microcystin in upper trophic levels.},

	abstract = {Background              Worldwide, natural communities are invaded by non-native species, with potentially devastating effects on the native communities. A large part of past research aimed at finding traits and characteristics of the invading species or the invaded community explaining observed invasions. Only recently, the focus shifted on the spatial patterns during invasions per se. Empirical data, however, are limited, as invasions are often unique incidences of a complex spatio-temporal process. In order to identify generalities of invasion patterns, we studied 13 naturally replicated tributary streams draining into Lake Constance, and studied the occurrence of native and non-native amphipods along linear transects from the stream outlets to the upstream headwater reaches.              Results              We found repeated spatial patterns of community composition and the occurrence of native and non-native amphipod species across two different years. Specifically, occurrence as well as abundance of two non-native amphipod species decreased from the stream outlets at the lake site towards upstream headwater reaches. Populations of the most common native amphipod species were largest at the uppermost headwater reaches. All populations of this native species, however, showed significant signals of recent genetic bottlenecks, irrespective of the stream position and occurrence of non-native species. Contrary to our expectations, this native species also showed no longitudinal genetic differentiation within individual tributaries as postulated for headwater versus outlet populations.              Conclusions              Our results indicate that invasions of river-systems may overall follow predictable patterns on the level of spatial distributions and community composition. However, effects of invading organisms on the genetic diversity and genetic structure of native populations observed at larger scales may not necessarily be directly reflected at the scale of smaller tributaries.},

	abstract = {Study of the determinants of species’ geographic distributions has a rich tradition in ecology and evolution, and understanding these determinants is becoming increasingly important in the face of climate change. While we know many range limits are set by abiotic stress, species interactions can also be important drivers of range limits. However, we lack any well-tested predictive framework for when and where each of these two broad classes of factors will most commonly set range limits.    A long-standing, but still nearly untested, hypothesis suggests that abiotic stress most often sets range limits in seemingly stressful areas, such as arctic, high-alpine, or arid systems, with species interactions having more influence in apparently benign environments, such as the tropics, low-elevation, or mesic places. In my dissertation, I experimentally tested a fundamental assumption of this hypothesis: namely, that the relative importance of species interactions and abiotic stress for population performance varies systematically with abiotic stress. I tested the relative importance of abiotic stress vs. three species interactions (herbivory, neighbors, and pollinators) for population dynamics of a model plant species in central Kenya, Hibiscus meyeri, across a sharp aridity gradient.     I find broad-scale support for Darwin’s hypothesis, with stronger effects of herbivores, neighbors, and pollinators on population growth rate in mesic areas v. arid areas. Interestingly, I find universal competitive effects of neighbors (rather than the switch from facilitative to competitive with increasing rainfall predicted by recent theoretical and empirical work). This work suggests that species interactions might be critical drivers of range limits only in unstressful regions of a species range.    This work also has implications for projecting shifts in species’ distributions. While in some cases, leaving biotic interactions out of species’ distribution models reduces accuracy, the vast majority of projections of shifts in distributions with climate change do not include such interactions. This work suggests that species distribution modelers should include species interactions in their predictions only in abiotically benign portions of a species range.},

	abstract = {Introduced predators can have large effects on the ecosystem in which they were introduced, but how much these effects extend to other ecosystems beyond the invaded one is less known. We compared how lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) affected nutrient cycling in an invaded and adjacent ecosystem in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. Introduced lake trout in Yellowstone Lake caused the native Yellowstone cutthroat trout (Oncoryhynchus clarkii bouvieri) population to decline. Native cutthroat trout are a dominant animal in the lake and may alter nutrient cycling in both Yellowstone Lake where they reside and in tributary streams used for spawning. We estimated changes in nutrient transport and nutrient uptake in both Yellowstone Lake and Clear Creek, a spawning stream, before and after the invasion of lake trout. Annual area‐specific excretion fluxes from cutthroat trout were nine times higher in Clear Creek compared to Yellowstone Lake when cutthroat trout were abundant. However, fluxes within the lake and stream were similar after cutthroat trout declined. In Yellowstone Lake, zooplankton excretion supplied 86\% of ammonium (NH4+) that was taken up, but cutthroat trout only supplied {\textless}0.3\% after the introduction of lake trout. Conversely, NH4+ excreted by cutthroat trout was likely a major flux in Clear Creek, because NH4+ fluxes from cutthroat trout exceeded watershed export of NH4+ in years when {\textgreater}3000 cutthroat trout spawned. Furthermore, NH4+ excretion fluxes from spawning cutthroat trout in Clear Creek supplied up to 6.1\% of the NH4+ demanded by microbes after the introduction of lake trout. However, based on modeled past NH4+ uptake, we estimated that up to 60\% of NH4+ excreted by spawning cutthroat trout may have been taken up by stream microbes when cutthroat trout were abundant. Therefore, transported NH4+ from spawning cutthroat trout was likely an integral part of N cycling in tributary streams in the past. By comparing the effects of declining cutthroat trout on two ecosystems, we show that lake trout had a larger effect on N cycling within an adjacent stream ecosystem than the invaded lake ecosystem itself, because the migratory behavior of cutthroat trout concentrated them in spawning streams increasing their effect.},

	abstract = {The round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), is one of the most invasive non-indigenous species in the Baltic Sea. It dominates coastal fisheries in some localities and is frequently found in offshore pelagic catches. This paper identifies management issues and suggests actions to be considered for post-invasion management. Priority should be given to the establishment of a coordinated pan-Baltic monitoring programme and associated data storage and exchange, as well as the compilation of landing statistics of the round goby in commercial and recreational fisheries. While eradication is unrealistic, population control that leads to minimising the risk of transfer to yet uncolonised areas in the Baltic Sea and adjacent waterbodies is feasible. This should comprise the requirement that the species be landed in commercial fishery bycatch, the management of ships’ ballast water and sediments, and hull fouling of inland and sea-going vessels, including recreational boats. Extensive involvement of stakeholders is crucial at all phases of the management process.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions are increasing in frequency and the need to mitigate or control their effects is a major challenge to natural resource managers. Failure to control invasive species has been attributed to inadequate policies, resources or scientific knowledge. Often, natural resource managers with limited funds are tasked with the development of an invasive species control program without access to key decision-support information such as whether or not an invasive species will cause damage, and what the extent of that damage may be. Once damages are realized, knowing where to allocate resources and target control efforts is not straightforward. Here we present the history of invasive species policy development and management in a large, multi-jurisdictional and multi-use aquatic ecosystem. We present a science-based decision-support tool for on-the-ground aquatic invasive species (AIS) control to support the development of a sustainable control program. Lastly, we provide a set of recommendations for managers desiring to make an AIS control implementation plan based upon our development of novel invasive species research, policy and management in Lake Tahoe (USA). We find that a sustainable invasive species control program is possible when science, coordination and outreach are integrated.},

	abstract = {Invasive planktonic crustaceans have become a prominent feature of aquatic communities worldwide, yet their effects on food webs are not well known. The Asian calanoid copepod, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, introduced to the Columbia River Estuary approximately 15 years ago, now dominates the late-summer zooplankton community, but its use by native aquatic predators is unknown. We investigated whether three species of planktivorous fishes (chinook salmon, three-spined stickleback, and northern pikeminnow) and one species of mysid exhibited higher feeding rates on native copepods and cladocerans relative to P. forbesi by conducting `single-prey’ feeding experiments and, additionally, examined selectivity for prey types with `two-prey’ feeding experiments. In single-prey experiments individual predator species showed no difference in feeding rates on native cyclopoid copepods (Cyclopidae spp.) relative to invasive P. forbesi, though wild-collected predators exhibited higher feeding rates on cyclopoids when considered in aggregate. In two-prey experiments, chinook salmon and northern pikeminnow both strongly selected native cladocerans (Daphnia retrocurva) over P. forbesi, and moreover, northern pikeminnow selected native Cyclopidae spp. over P. forbesi. On the other hand, in two-prey experiments, chinook salmon, three-spined stickleback and mysids were non- selective with respect to feeding on native cyclopoid copepods versus P. forbesi. Our results indicate that all four native predators in the Columbia River Estuary can consume the invasive copepod, P. forbesi, but that some predators select for native zooplankton over P. forbesi, most likely due to one (or both) of two possible underlying casual mechanisms: 1) differential taxon-specific prey motility and escape responses (calanoids {\textgreater} cyclopoids {\textgreater} daphnids) or 2) the invasive status of the zooplankton prey resulting in naivety, and thus lower feeding rates, of native predators feeding on invasive prey.},

	abstract = {The freshwater drum is Manitoba's oddest fish. Asked to describe its physical appearance, one might want to emphasize its terrific personality. It is found from Guatemala in the south to the Nelson River in the north and is named for the drumming sound males use to attract females during the mating season. And it eats zebra mussels. Lots of zebra mussels. Unlike our other fish, it has pharyngeal teeth top and bottom built for crushing shellfish, and unlike other fish, it can eat even the biggest zebra mussels. When mussels are abundant, drum graze on them all day long.              Drum in tandem with other fish predators can help us curb zebra mussel numbers, possibly keeping a bad situation (the best case) from becoming disastrously bad. But they need our help. Large drum are the most effective predators as they don't start eating mussels until the drum reach 25 to 35 centimetres in length, and drum grow slowly. Research in my lab has shown Lake Winnipeg drum take 20 to 40 years to reach 60 cm. The largest drum can reach a metre in length and more than 70 years of age.              Manitoba anglers know better than most the dangers of zebra mussels. An uncontrolled invasion will be disastrous for our pickerel, sauger, perch and whitefish. Releasing drum back into the water so they can munch on mussels would be a small cost to pay to limit far greater damage. And it wouldn't cost Manitoba taxpayers a dime.},

Methods: We analyzed this relationship in a community of aquatic invertebrates associated to roots of Eichhornia crassipes in 15 shallow marginal lakes in the Pantanal National Park and surroundings. We sampled quadrants of floating vegetation, identified the aggregate fauna and evaluated the density effect of Limnoperna fortunei, as well as abiotic factors of the Trichoptera community using ordinances and multivariate regressions. Results: We found no significant relationship between the abundance of mussels on the macrophytes and the Trichoptera larvae. However, we observed an interference of oxygen on the structure and density of genera. The composition and abundance of the phytophylous caddisfly community is influenced by the depth and the concentration of oxygen dissolved in the marginal regions of the lakes. Conclusions: We suggest that the absence of the effects of the assessed L. fortunei in the community is related to the 'biotic resistance', in which the phytophylous caddisfly demonstrated adaptation to an environment characterized by hypoxic conditions in the dry season. L. fortunei was limited by the depth and reduction of oxygen, presenting lower density in lakes with such characteristics.},

To date we lack information on how various environmental gradients and biotic interactions separately and interactively shape the distribution patterns of mussels in non-tidal environments. Opposing to tidal environments, mussels inhabit solely subtidal zone in non-tidal waterbodies and, thereby, driving factors for mussel populations are expected to differ from the tidal areas. In the present study, we used the boosted regression tree modelling (BRT), an ensemble method for statistical techniques and machine learning, in order to explain the distribution and biomass of the suspension feeding mussel Mytilus trossulus in the non-tidal Baltic Sea. BRT models suggested that (1) distribution patterns of M. trossulus are largely driven by separate effects of direct environmental gradients and partly by interactive effects of resource gradients with direct environmental gradients. (2) Within its suitable habitat range, however, resource gradients had an important role in shaping the biomass distribution of M. trossulus. (3) Contrary to tidal areas, mussels were not competitively superior over macrophytes with patterns indicating either facilitative interactions between mussels and macrophytes or co-variance due to common stressor. To conclude, direct environmental gradients seem to define the distribution pattern of M. trossulus, and within the favourable distribution range, resource gradients in interaction with direct environmental gradients are expected to set the biomass level of mussels.},

Anthropogenic disturbances, including altered flow regimes, habitat alteration, and pollution, are the major driver of this group's decline. We investigated the effects of tertiary treated municipal wastewater effluent on survivorship, growth, and condition of freshwater mussels in experimental cages in a small Central Texas stream. We tested the effluent effects by measuring basic physical parameters of native three ridge mussels (Amblema plicata) and of non-native Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea), before and after 72-day exposure at four sites above and below a municipal wastewater treatment plant outfall. Survivorship and growth of the non-native Asian clams and growth and condition indices of the native three ridge mussels were significantly higher at the reference site above the outfall than in downstream sites. We attribute this reduction in fitness below the outfall to elevated nutrient and heavy metal concentrations, and the potential presence of other untested-for compounds commonly found in municipal effluent. These results, along with an absence of native mussels below the discharge, indicate a significant negative impact of wastewater effluent on both native and non-native mussels in the stream.},

	abstract = {Species introduced to the Great Lakes region through shipping, pet and nursery trade, and as biological control have caused significant environmental damages and have increased the direct and indirect costs to boat owners and various water-dependent industries. Once established, recreational boating becomes the primary vector of spread for some of these species, such as zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha Pallas, 1771). Prevention and mitigation efforts in the past have focused on boater education, boat washing stations, and inspections; yet these management actions can be expensive with limited or largely unknown effectiveness. In this study, we used a gravity model framework to accurately simulate the spread of an aquatic invasive species. After parameterization, the constructed model effectively simulated the human-mediated movements of the historical dreissenid spread patterns, correctly predicting an average accuracy of 78.2\% (standard deviation = 0.01\%) lakes invaded per model run. We then used the model to determine the effectiveness of three different invasive species management scenarios in Michigan: deterring boaters from lakes with a high likelihood of invasion, targeted education at high-risk lakes, and a large-scale education effort. Results indicated that deterring boaters from high-risk lakes is effective in the first five years of an invasion, targeted education is more effective at late stages of an invasion, and large-scale education is effective at all stages of an invasion. Our results indicate that managers should be flexible in their management actions and that different strategies are likely more effective at different stages of an invasion.},

	abstract = {Background              Introduced species can modify local host-parasite dynamics by amplifying parasite infection which can 'spill-back' to the native fauna, whether they are competent hosts for local parasites, or by acting as parasite sinks with 'dilution' of infection decreasing the parasite burden of native hosts. Recently infection by the trematode Bucephalus polymorphus has increased in several European rivers, being attributed to the introduction of intermediate host species from the Ponto-Caspian region. Using a combination of field and experimental data, we evaluated the competence of non-native and native fish as intermediate hosts for B. polymorphus and its role for parasite development in a definitive host.              Methods              The density of 0+ juvenile fish (the second intermediate hosts for B. polymorphus) was measured in the River Morava, Czech Republic and fish were screened for natural metacercariae infection. The stomach contents of predatory fish that are definitive hosts of B. polymorphus were examined to assess the importance of non-native gobies for parasite transmission. In semi-natural conditions, parasite establishment, initial survival, and maturity rates in experimentally infected definitive hosts pikeperch Sander lucioperca were measured in flukes recovered from native white bream Abramis bjoerkna and non-native tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris and round goby Neogobius melanostomus. Adult fluke size and egg production was also measured to evaluate the potential effect of intermediate host species on parasite fitness.              Results              We detected high natural infection parameters of B. polymorphus in native cyprinids and non-native gobies compared to data from the period prior to goby establishment. Both fish groups are consumed by predatory fish and represent a major component of the littoral fish community. Parasite establishment and adult size in definitive hosts was equivalent among the second intermediate host species, despite a lower size of metacercariae recovered from round gobies. However, development in the definitive host of flukes recovered from gobies was reduced, showing higher mortality, delayed maturity and lower egg production, in comparison with parasites from native hosts.              Conclusions              Substantial 'spill-back' of B. polymorphus due to higher transmission rates after establishment of non-native gobies was partially buffered by decreased fitness of B. polymorphus that underwent development in gobies.},

After observations of persistence of amphipods at the highest reaches of a small fishless stream that experiences relatively severe flooding, the present study sought to determine if a relationship existed between stream elevation and microhabitat type with respect to amphipod abundance.  Do certain microhabitats serve as systematically better refuges in flooding streams?  This study also sought to determine if there was a relationship between amphipod size and stream elevation.  Do larger or smaller amphipods persists better at different stream elevations?  Two surveys were conducted in July 2015 with sampling at 8 different elevation zones which included 5 microhabitats.  One survey was conducted in August 2015 at 10 different elevation zones (8 of which were repeat areas from July), with samples taken from various elevations along the stream from 5 microhabitats.  A total of 2,616 amphipods (Gammarus pseudolimnaeus) were collected over the two-month time period, collected, counted and body length measured.   Results did not show a relationship between amphipod body length and stream elevation, nor was there a relationship between amphipod abundance and stream elevation.},

The goal of this work is to study the diet of topmouth gudgeon and trophic relationships with some native fishes inhabiting the littoral zone of the Dniprodzerzhynsk reservoir. The obtained relatively low values of diet overlaps between topmouth gudgeon and other co-occurring cyprinids such as juvenile roach, Rutilus rutilus; silver bream, Blicca bjoerkna; rudd, Scardinius erythrophthalmus; Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio and bleak, Abramis brama, indicate that it is not a serious food competitor for them, especially commercially valuable ones. On the contrary, high diet overlaps were observed among some native cyprinids such as juvenile roach, silver bream, rudd, and bleak. The major prey items of topmouth gudgeon were Chydorus sphaericus and chironomids, whereas other cyprinids selected Bosmina spp. This peculiarity may be due to different vertical distributions of these fish in the littoral zone of the reservoir, where topmouth gudgeon inhabit near-bottom water layers, where they preyed on near-bottom and benthic zooplankters and chironomids, while juvenile roach, silver bream, rudd, and juvenile and adult bleak live in higher water layers, where they preyed on pelagic zooplankton.Alternate abstract:Le Pseudorasbora, Pseudorasbora parva, est le poisson le plus envahissant en Europe, qui peut entrer en compétition avec les juvéniles de poissons de valeur commerciale localement.

	abstract = {Background Theory predicts that prey facing a combination of predators with different feeding modes have two options: to express a response against the feeding mode of the most dangerous predator, or to express an intermediate response. Intermediate phenotypes protect equally well against several feeding modes, rather than providing specific protection against a single predator. Anti-predator traits that protect against a common feeding mode displayed by all predators should be expressed regardless of predator combination, as there is no need for trade-offs. Principal Findings We studied phenotypic anti-predator responses of zebra mussels to predation threat from a handling-time-limited (crayfish) and a gape-size-limited (roach) predator. Both predators dislodge mussels from the substrate but diverge in their further feeding modes. Mussels increased expression of a non-specific defense trait (attachment strength) against all combinations of predators relative to a control. In response to roach alone, mussels showed a tendency to develop a weaker and more elongated shell. In response to crayfish, mussels developed a harder and rounder shell. When exposed to either a combination of predators or no predator, mussels developed an intermediate phenotype. Mussel growth rate was positively correlated with an elongated weaker shell and negatively correlated with a round strong shell, indicating a trade-off between anti-predator responses. Field observations of prey phenotypes revealed the presence of both anti-predator phenotypes and the trade-off with growth, but intra-specific population density and bottom substrate had a greater influence than predator density. Conclusions Our results show that two different predators can exert both functionally equivalent and inverse selection pressures on a single prey. Our field study suggests that abiotic factors and prey population density should be considered when attempting to explain phenotypic diversity in the wild.},

	abstract = {Diffuse competition, based on niche overlap of an invader with most native species in a community, is considered a mechanism preventing its successful establishment in the community. However, native species must themselves have extensive niche overlap, implying that diffuse competition can be reversed if some external force increases numbers of the introduced species while native community numbers remain unchanged. Reverse diffuse competition, defined as an invader that outcompetes most of the native community, can then lower numbers of native species. We illustrate these principles by documenting diffuse competition between the introduced Japanese White‐eye (Zosterops japonicus) and eight species of Hawaiian forest birds at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge followed by reverse diffuse competition. Competition was based on extensive overlap of multiple foraging substrates with native species. The external force which reversed diffuse competition was a restoration area contiguous with much of the old‐growth forest where diffuse competition previously occurred. Propagule pressure from that area increased white‐eye numbers in the old‐growth forest, without initial change in numbers of native birds, resulting in greater than sixfold increase in adult white‐eyes on our study site. This increase resulted in stunted skeletal growth of young birds, and diverse changes in molt of both young and adults of native birds and white‐eyes. While native birds declined from stunted growth, white‐eyes increased adult survival. Changes in condition of native birds in time and space matched associated changes in white‐eye density. Normalizing natural selection of lower mass and shorter bills resulted in loss of almost half of native birds in a 3373 ha area of the refuge, adjacent to the restoration area, and 10\% of native birds in a lower 1998 ha area. Competition with female native birds was initially stronger than with males as indicated by more male‐biased adult sex ratios in five species. Structure of the forest, small size of arthropods available, greater use of the understory, and lower minimum air temperature resulted in successful white‐eye competition with the entire native community. Reverse diffuse competition is a process in community ecology and a way an additional species can be packed into a community.},

	abstract = {Economic evaluations of invasive species are essential for providing comprehensive assessments of the benefits and costs of publicly-funded management activities, yet many previous investigations have focused narrowly on expenditures to control spread and infestation. We use hedonic modeling to evaluate the economic effects of Eurasian milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) invasions on lakefront property values of single-family homes in an urban-suburban landscape. Milfoil often forms dense canopies at the water surface, diminishing the value of ecosystem services (e.g., recreation, fishing) and necessitating expensive control and management efforts. We compare 1,258 lakeshore property sale transactions (1995–2006) in 17 lakes with milfoil and 24 un-invaded lakes in King County, Washington (USA). After accounting for structural (e.g., house size), locational (e.g., boat launch), and environmental characteristics (e.g., water clarity) of lakes, we found that milfoil has a significant negative effect on property sales price (\$94,385 USD lower price), corresponding to a 19\% decline in mean property values. The aggregate cost of milfoil invading one additional lake in the study area is, on average, \$377,542 USD per year. Our study illustrates that invasive aquatic plants can significantly impact property values (and associated losses in property taxes that reduce local government revenue), justifying the need for management strategies that prevent and control invasions. We recommend coordinated efforts across Lake Management Districts to focus institutional support, funding, and outreach to prevent the introduction and spread of milfoil. This effort will limit opportunities for re-introduction from neighboring lakes and incentivize private landowners and natural resource agencies to commit time and funding to invasive species management.},

	abstract = {The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ranks invasive species as the second leading cause of biodiversity loss globally, next only to habitat destruction. Once an invasive species becomes established, it can be extremely difficult to control its spread. Here at the ROM. our invasive species research includes establishing a taxonomic baseline for understanding the dispersal of species, which is critical in recognizing and distinguishing potential invasive alien species.


Some aquatic species capable of causing significant problems, such as the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) and zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), are already established in Ontario, significantly threatening the Great Lakes ecosystem. Changes to this ecosystem can have far-reaching impacts upon people who rely on the system for transportation, trade, and recreation. Invasive plants cost the agriculture and forest industries in Canada about \$7.3 billion annually, while damage associated with zebra mussels has cost between \$3 billion and \$7.5 billion. Over 66 percent of Ontario's speciesat-risk are threatened by invasive species. Therefore, preventing invasive species from entering Ontario in the first place is crucial.


If the legislation is passed, Ontario will be the first and only jurisdiction in Canada to introduce stand-alone invasive species legislation. This legislation would provide a focused set of regulatory tools specifically designed to address invasive species. This includes the tools to ban activities such as possessing and transporting certain invasive species, and tools to allow the government to intervene earlier and enable rapid response actions, including working with partners to stop the spread of invasive species and ensuring compliance through modernized inspection and enforcement measures.},

	abstract = {Toledo Harbor (Maumee River and Maumee Bay) is a “port of concern” for introduction of non-indigenous species into the Great Lakes due to the large amounts of ballast water from outside the Great Lakes discharged at the port, the amenable habitat for many potential invasives, and the large amount of ballast water transported from Toledo to other Great Lakes ports, making Toledo a potential source of invasives throughout the entire region. To estimate sampling intensity needed to detect rare or new non-indigenous species, 27 benthic grab samples from 13 locations near Toledo Harbor were collected during autumn, 2010. Benthic organisms were identified, and sampling intensity needed to detect rare or new non-indigenous species was evaluated via a Chao asymptotic richness estimator. Morphological taxonomic criteria and cytochrome oxidase I (COI) sequence barcodes identified 29 different taxa (20 to species level) in the samples, including six non-indigenous taxa (Branchiura sowerbyi, Bithynia tentaculata, Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena polymorpha, Dreissena bugensis, Lipiniella sp.). While all the non-indigenous species had previously been reported in Lake Erie or nearby Ohio waters, several North American species are not previously listed in Ohio. Richness estimates indicate that {\textgreater}75\% of the benthic species in the area were encountered and that 90\% of the species could be detected with less than a doubling of collecting effort. Since sampling for this study occurred only in the autumn and detectable life stages of benthic organisms may vary seasonally, additional species may be observed with more extensive sampling over a broader seasonal range.},

In aquatic environments, the detection of rare or low-abundance species is challenging at best, and discriminating between detection failure (null) and true absence (zero) can be difficult. We developed and applied environmental DNA (eDNA) markers to screen for occurrences of bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), silver carp (H. molitrix), and grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) in Ontario waters of Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair, and tributaries, as part of ongoing efforts to prevent these Asian carps from becoming established in the Great Lakes. A network of 180 sites in nearshore and tributary habitats, selected based on perceived risk of fish access or habitat suitability, were sampled using both boat electrofishing and/or eDNA sampling (948 water samples) throughout the 2012 open-water season. Electrofishing efforts did not capture any Asian carps, and no positive detections of environmental DNA for any of these species were obtained using both conventional and quantitative PCR. These combined results suggest that these Asian carp species are not yet established in Ontario waters of Lake Erie or Lake St. Clair, and highlight the value of combining conventional fisheries assessment and environmental DNA surveillance for assessing the potential presence of invasive species in freshwater systems.},

It can inhabit waters with a wide range of temperatures and salinity and handle long-term periods of air exposure. We describe the transcriptome of L. fortunei aiming to give a first insight into the phenotypic plasticity that allows non-native taxa to become established and widespread. We sequenced 95,219 reads from five main tissues of the mussel L. fortunei using Roche’s 454 and assembled them to form a set of 84,063 unigenes (contigs and singletons) representing partial or complete gene sequences. We annotated 24,816 unigenes using a BLAST sequence similarity search against a NCBI nr database. Unigenes were divided into 20 eggNOG functional categories and 292 KEGG metabolic pathways. From the total unigenes, 1,351 represented putative full-length genes of which 73.2\% were functionally annotated. We described the first partial and complete gene sequences in order to start understanding bivalve invasiveness. An expansion of the hsp70 gene family, seen also in other bivalves, is present in L. fortunei and could be involved in its adaptation to extreme environments, e.g. during intertidal periods. The presence of toll-like receptors gives a first insight into an immune system that could be more complex than previously assumed and may be involved in the prevention of disease and extinction when population densities are high. Finally, the apparent lack of special adaptations to extremely low O2 levels is a target worth pursuing for the development of a molecular control approach.},

	abstract = {Propagule pressure and habitat characteristics are important factors used to predict the distribution of invasive alien species. For species exhibiting strong propagule pressure because of human-mediated introduction of species, indicators of introduction potential must represent the behavioral characteristics of humans. This study examined 64 agricultural ponds to assess the visibility of ponds from surrounding roads and its value as a surrogate of propagule pressure to explain the presence and absence of two invasive fish species. A three-dimensional viewshed analysis using a geographic information system quantified the visual exposure of respective ponds to humans. Binary classification trees were developed as a function of their visibility from roads, as well as five environmental factors: river density, connectivity with upstream dam reservoirs, pond area, chlorophyll a concentration, and pond drainage. Traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction (road density and proportion of urban land-use area) were alternatively included for comparison instead of visual exposure. The presence of Bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) was predicted by the ponds' higher visibility from roads and pond connection with upstream dam reservoirs. Results suggest that fish stocking into ponds and their dispersal from upstream sources facilitated species establishment. Largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) distribution was constrained by chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting their lower adaptability to various environments than that of Bluegill. Based on misclassifications from classification trees for Bluegill, pond visual exposure to roads showed greater predictive capability than traditional indicators of human-mediated introduction. Pond visibility is an effective predictor of invasive species distribution. Its wider use might improve management and mitigate further invasion. The visual exposure of recipient ecosystems to humans is important for many invasive species that spread with frequent instances of human-mediated introduction.},

	abstract = {The spread and impact of alien species among freshwater ecosystems has increased with global trade and human movement; therefore, quantifying the role of anthropogenic and ecological factors that increase the risk of invasion is an important conservation goal. Two factors considered as null models when assessing the potential for invasion are colonization pressure (i.e., the number of species introduced) and propagule pressure [i.e., the number (propagule size), and frequency (propagule number), of individuals of each species introduced]. We translate the terminology of species abundance distributions to the invasion terminology of propagule size and colonization size (PS and CS, respectively). We conduct hypothesis testing to determine the underlying statistical species abundance distribution for zooplankton assemblages transported between freshwater ecosystems; and, on the basis of a lognormal distribution, construct four hypothetical assemblages spanning assemblage structure, rank-abundance gradient (e.g., even vs uneven), total abundance (of all species combined), and relative contribution of PS vs CS. For a given CS, many combinations of PS and total abundance can occur when transported assemblages conform to a lognormal species abundance distribution; therefore, for a given transportation event, many combinations of CS and PS are possible with potentially different ecological outcomes. An assemblage exhibiting high PS but low CS (species poor, but highly abundant) may overcome demographic barriers to establishment, but with lower certainty of amenable environmental conditions in the recipient region; whereas, the opposite extreme, high CS and low PS (species rich, but low abundance per species) may provide multiple opportunities for one of n arriving species to circumvent environmental barriers, albeit with lower potential to overcome demographic constraints. Species abundance distributions and the corresponding influence of CS and PS are some of many influential factors (e.g., demographic and genetic stochasticity, environmental variability, composition of recipient ecosystems) that will help refine an understanding of establishment risk following the human-mediated movement of species.},

	abstract = {Species moved by human activities beyond the limits of their native geographic ranges into areas in which they do not naturally occur (termed aliens) can cause a broad range of significant changes to recipient ecosystems; however, their impacts vary greatly across species and the ecosystems into which they are introduced. There is therefore a critical need for a standardised method to evaluate, compare, and eventually predict the magnitudes of these different impacts. Here, we propose a straightforward system for classifying alien species according to the magnitude of their environmental impacts, based on the mechanisms of impact used to code species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Invasive Species Database, which are presented here for the first time. The classification system uses five semi-quantitative scenarios describing impacts under each mechanism to assign species to different levels of impact--ranging from Minimal to Massive--with assignment corresponding to the highest level of deleterious impact associated with any of the mechanisms. The scheme also includes categories for species that are Not Evaluated, have No Alien Population, or are Data Deficient, and a method for assigning uncertainty to all the classifications. We show how this classification system is applicable at different levels of ecological complexity and different spatial and temporal scales, and embraces existing impact metrics. In fact, the scheme is analogous to the already widely adopted and accepted Red List approach to categorising extinction risk, and so could conceivably be readily integrated with existing practices and policies in many regions.},

In order to assess the current position regarding IAS in Europe and to determine the issues that were deemed to be most important or critical regarding these damaging species, the international Freshwater Invasives - Networking for Strategy (FINS) conference was convened in Ireland in April 2013. Delegates from throughout Europe and invited speakers from around the world were brought together for the conference. These comprised academics, applied scientists, policy makers, politicians, practitioners and representative stakeholder groups. A horizon scanning and issue prioritization approach was used by in excess of 100 expert delegates in a workshop setting to elucidate the Top 20 IAS issues in Europe. These issues do not focus solely on freshwater habitats and taxa but relate also to marine and terrestrial situations. The Top 20 issues that resulted represent a tool for IAS management and should also be used to support policy makers as they prepare European IAS legislation.},

In some cases, disease is brought about by the consumption of foods high in thiaminase I activity. Levels of thiaminase activity in these foods are highly variable and the factors leading to production of this enzyme are poorly understood. Here we describe improvements in a spectrophotometric thiaminase I activity assay that measures the disappearance of 4-nitrothiophenol, a favored nucleophile co-substrate that replaces the thiazole portion of thiamine during the inactivation of thiamine by the enzyme. Scalable sample processing protocols and a 96-well microtiter plate format are presented that allow the rapid evaluation of multiple, replicated samples in the course of only a few hours. Observed levels of activity in bacterial culture supernatant, fish, ferns and molluscs using this colorimetric assay were similar to previously published reports that employed a radiometric method. Organisms devoid of thiaminase I, based upon previous work, showed no activity with this assay. In addition, activity was found in a variety of fishes and one fern species from which this enzyme had not previously been reported. Overall, we demonstrate the suitability of this technique for measuring thiaminase I activity within small amounts of tissue and environmental samples with replication levels that were heretofore prohibitive. The assay provides a considerable improvement in the ability to examine and understand the properties of an enzyme that has a substantial influence on organism and ecosystem health.},

	abstract = {Our ability to measure global climate change has generated dire predictions in global ecosystem conditions. These predictions have inspired efforts to develop assessment metrics that examine alterations in ecological condition resulting from climate dynamics. As climate change drives future watershed- or regional-scale assessment model development, many questions will need to be addressed concerning potential tool constraints. Chief among these will be: to what degree is ecosystem condition affected by anthropogenic disturbance, climate-driven disturbance or natural variability, both individually and in combination? As a first step toward assessing impacts on ecological condition resulting from climate driven spatial or temporal disturbance gradients, an assessment methodology would need to be developed for ecosystems with limited direct human land use disturbance. In the first of three case studies, I propose such an assessment methodology for Glacier National Park (GNP), Montana. This approach combines theoretical elements of biological and ecosystem structural assessments with approaches developed for risk and landscape assessments to approach to assist GNP with prioritizing natural resource monitoring and management and with informing the public on the current condition of the park's ecosystem.   There has been increased accessibility to publicly available thematic maps derived from Landsat imagery that can be used to develop watershed or regional assessment tools in remote areas. Most remote sensing products have associated assessment of its error. However, the impacts of these uncertainties on landscape scale multi-metric management tools are poorly developed. In my second case study, I provide an approach that incorporates these errors into the assessment process.   Finally, dynamics of ecosystem are rarely incorporated into assessment tools as a means to distinguish natural variability from one perturbed by climate or anthropogenic disturbance. The Shifting Habitat Mosaic Concept addresses variability of floodplain habitat patch composition and provides a platform to develop potential assessment metrics for dynamics in floodplain habitat condition as climate shifts. In the third case study, I document the influence of multiple disturbance regimes across several geomorphic settings through a remotely sensed, multi-decadal whole-river census as a step towards developing effective metrics that measure perturbations in the variability of floodplain condition.},

	abstract = {Environmentally-derived elemental and isotopic ratios in the otoliths of anadromous river herring (alewife, Alosa pseudoharengus, and blueback herring, A. aestivalis) were used to distinguish among groups of fish at spatial scales ranging from sub-populations within a watershed to populations from throughout the species' ranges. These ratios were also used to understand early life migrations and habitat use within and among populations. Sub-populations within the Hudson River, NY were accurately distinguished ({\textgreater} 95\%), and populations from the Hudson River and Long Island, NY were distinct from each other and outgroups at varying distances, but accurate classification was dependent on the inclusion of oxygen isotopic ratios. Populations from Maine to Florida showed strong separation based on otolith signatures excluding (∼ 70\%) and including ({\textgreater} 90\%) oxygen isotopes. Reclassification accuracies improved for both models by including genetic results in a hierarchical assignment model. Though all natural tags were effective for stock discrimination, the accuracy varied depending on the markers included; while inclusion of oxygen isotopes resulted in the highest reclassification rates, accurate application requires intensive sampling because of high interannual variability. Genetic markers reduce the effects of interannual variation because they are generally stable over generations.    Variations in otolith chemistry across an otolith (i.e. the fish's life history) can provide information about movements among habitats and especially along salinity gradients. Juvenile alewife within the Hudson River, NY (a large watershed) moved among multiple freshwater habitats, and trends varied widely among individuals while in the Peconic River, NY (a small, coastal watershed) three distinct movement patterns were observed. Retrospective analysis of Hudson River adult otoliths showed that multiple nursery habitats contribute to the spawning stock. Throughout the coast, retrospective analysis of adult otoliths showed that juveniles used fresh waters, estuaries, or a combination of both as nursery habitats and migratory behavior varied among populations, and were correlated to the latitude of the watershed, the watershed area, the amount of accessible river kilometers, and the percentage of the watershed in urban use.},

	abstract = {In June 2012 a single non-native snakehead fish was captured by local officials in a small pond within an urban park in Burnaby, British Columbia. This single snakehead fish garnered significant attention in the local and national media. DNA analysis determined it to be a blotched snakehead (Channa maculata) or possibly a hybrid; a warm water species native to China and Vietnam which is commonly sold in the live food fish trade, and occasionally kept by hobbyists. By collecting prey items from the pond and snakehead specimens from fish markets we used a novel stable isotope approach to estimate how long it had been since the snakehead had been released into the pond. Using a diet-switching tissue turnover model, we estimated that the snakehead was in the pond between 33 and 93 days. Subsequently, provincial legislation was amended to ban all species of snakehead fish, as well as numerous other potentially invasive fish and invertebrate species.},

	abstract = {Invasive species are leading drivers of environmental change. Their impacts are often linked to their population size, but surprisingly little is known about how frequently they achieve high abundances. A nearly universal pattern in ecology is that species are rare in most locations and abundant in a few, generating right-skewed abundance distributions. Here, we use abundance data from over 24,000 populations of 17 invasive and 104 native aquatic species to test whether invasive species differ from native counterparts in statistical patterns of abundance across multiple sites. Invasive species on average reached significantly higher densities than native species and exhibited significantly higher variance. However, invasive and native species did not differ in terms of coefficient of variation, skewness, or kurtosis. Abundance distributions of all species were highly right skewed (skewness{\textgreater}0), meaning both invasive and native species occurred at low densities in most locations where they were present. The average abundance of invasive and native species was 6\% and 2\%, respectively, of the maximum abundance observed within a taxonomic group. The biological significance of the differences between invasive and native species depends on species-specific relationships between abundance and impact. Recognition of cross-site heterogeneity in population densities brings a new dimension to invasive species management, and may help to refine optimal prevention, containment, control, and eradication strategies.},

	abstract = {Invasive species are currently considered one of the most important threats to global biodiversity. Established invaders are difficult to eradicate and management requires biosecurity measures to prevent secondary spread. Corbicula fluminea (Müller, 1774; Asian clam) has a worldwide invasive distribution and, as an ecosystem engineer, can have dramatic impacts on recipient systems, displacing native species and altering trophic structure. This study tested the efficacy of biosecurity methods for cleansing angling equipment (such as nets and waders) and other gear used in freshwater that may harbour C. fluminea and contribute to their secondary spread. C. fluminea of varying size were treated either with Virkon® Aquatic, common household bleach or salt at a variety of concentrations for a range of immersion times. Virkon® emerged as the most effective of the three treatment types and achieved 93.3\% mortality when used at 2\% for 5 minutes. With the bleach trials, there was no significant effect of immersion time on clam mortality, but 10\% bleach for 60 minutes induced an average mortality of 76.7\%. Further, maximum mortality in saltwater was only 13.3\% with 60 minutes immersion. There was no significant difference in mortality among clam sizes. Virkon® is, therefore, recommended as the most effective product for treating angling and other gear that could potentially harbour and spread C. fluminea. We also assessed the effect of ‘drying times’ post-treatment and this was demonstrated to have no significant effect on clam mortality. Virkon® again gave the highest mortality of the three treatments, with 68.9\% mortality achieved at 2\% for 10 minutes. Overall, Virkon® emerges as an effective biosecurity measure, but further research is required to attain 100\% mortality. Bleach may be useful when Virkon® is not available, but salt is relatively ineffective.},

	abstract = {Few studies have systematically investigated differences in performance, morphology and parasitic load of invaders at different stages of an invasion. This study analyzed phenotype-environment correlations in a fish invasion from initial absence until establishment in the headwater reach of the second largest European river, the Danube. Here, the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) formed 73\% of the fish abundance and 58\% of the fish biomass in rip-rap bank habitats after establishment. The time from invasion until establishment was only about two years, indicating rapid expansion. Founder populations from the invasion front were different from longer established round goby populations in demography, morphology, feeding behaviour, sex ratio and parasitic load, indicating that plasticity in these traits determines invasion success. Competitive ability was mostly dependent on growth/size-related traits rather than on fecundity. As revealed by stable isotope analyses, specimens at the invasion front had a higher trophic position in the food web and seem to benefit from lower food competition. Somatic performance seems to be more important than investment in reproduction during the early stages of the invasion process and upstream-directed range expansion is not caused by out-migrating weak or juvenile individuals that were forced to leave high density areas due to high competition. This mechanism might be true for downstream introductions via drift. Greater abundance and densities of acanthocephalan endoparasites were observed at the invasion front, which contradicts the expectation that invasion success is determined by lower parasitic pressure in newly invaded areas. Overall, the pronounced changes in fish and invertebrate communities with a dominance of alien species suggest invasional meltdown and a shift of the upper Danube River towards a novel ecosystem with species that have greater resistance to goby predation. This seems to contribute to overcoming biological resistance and improve rapidity of dispersal.},

Here we investigated variation in the fatty acid (FA) composition of seston and primary consumers within (i.e., among habitats) and among tributary systems of Lake Michigan, USA. FA composition of food is important because all metazoans require certain FAs for proper growth and development that cannot be produced de novo, including many polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Here we sampled three habitat types (river, rivermouth and nearshore zone) in 11 tributaries of Lake Michigan to assess the amount of FA in seston and primary consumers of seston. We hypothesize that among-system and among-habitat variation in FAs at the base of food webs would be related to algal production, which in turn is influenced by three land cover characteristics: 1) combined agriculture and urban lands (an indication of anthropogenic nutrient inputs that fuel algal production), 2) the proportion of surface waters (an indication of water residence times that allow algal producers to accumulate) and 3) the extent of riparian forested buffers (an indication of stream shading that reduces algal production). Of these three land cover characteristics, only intense land use appeared to strongly related to seston and consumer FA and this effect was only strong in rivermouth and nearshore lake sites. River seston and consumer FA composition was highly variable, but that variation does not appear to be driven by the watershed land cover characteristics investigated here. Whether the spatial variation in FA content at the base of these food webs significantly influences the production of economically important species higher in the food web should be a focus of future research.},

	abstract = {Saline to freshwater invasions have become increasingly common in recent years. A key hypothesis is that rates of freshwater invasions have been amplified in recent years by increased food concentration, yet this hypothesis has remained unexplored. We examined whether elevated food concentration could enhance freshwater tolerance, and whether this effect evolves following saline to freshwater invasions. We examined physiological response to salinity and food concentration in a 2 × 2 factorial design, using ancestral brackish and freshwater invading populations of the copepod Eurytemora affinis. We found that high food concentration significantly increases low‐salinity tolerance. This effect was reduced in the freshwater population, indicating evolution following the freshwater invasion. Thus, ample food could enable freshwater invasions, allowing subsequent evolution of low‐salinity tolerance even under food‐poor conditions. We also compared effects of food concentration on freshwater survival between two brackish populations from the native range. Impacts of food concentration on freshwater survival differed between the brackish populations, suggesting variation in functional properties affecting their propensity to invade freshwater habitats. The key implication is that high food concentration could profoundly extend range expansions of brackishwater species into freshwater habitats, potentially allowing for condition‐specific competition between saline invaders and resident freshwater species.},

	abstract = {Patchiness of habitat has important influences on distributions and abundances of organisms. Given the increasing threat of loss and alteration of habitats due to pressures associated with humans, there is a need for ecologists to understand species' requirements for habitat and to predict changes to taxa under various future environmental conditions. This study tested hypotheses about the generality of patterns described for one species of marine intertidal turban snail for a different, yet closely-related species in subtidal habitats along the coast of New South Wales, Australia. These two closely-related species live in similar habitats, yet under quite different conditions, which provided an opportunity to investigate how similar types of habitats influence patterns of distribution, abundance and size-structure in intertidal versus subtidal environments. For each species, there were similar associations between biogenically structured habitat and densities. The intertidal species, Turbo undulates, were more abundant, with greater proportions of small individuals in habitats formed by the canopy-forming alga, Hormosira banksii, the solitary ascidian, Pyura stolonifera or the turfing red alga, Corallina officinalis compared to simple habitat (bare rock). Similarly, more Turbo torquatus were found in biogenically structured subtidal habitat, i.e. canopy-forming algae, Ecklonia radiata, mixed algal communities (‘fringe’), or turfing red algae (Corallina officinalis and Amphiroa aniceps) than where habitat is simple (barrens). Small T. torquatus were more abundant in areas of turf and ‘fringe’, while large snails were more abundant in areas of kelp and barrens. These patterns were found at each location sampled (i.e. eight intertidal and two subtidal rocky reefs) and at all times of sampling, across each environment. This study highlighted the consistent influence of biogenically structured habitats on the distribution, abundance and size-structure of intertidal and subtidal turban snails and forms a basis for increasing the understanding of the potential underlying processes causing such patterns.},

Research on biological invasions has generated a large literature on many different aspects of this phenomenon. Here, we describe and categorize some aspects of this literature, to better understand what has been studied and what we know, mapping well‐studied areas and important gaps. To do so, we employ the techniques of systematic reviewing widely adopted in other scientific disciplines, to further the use of approaches in reviewing the literature that are as scientific, repeatable, and transparent as those employed in a primary study. We identified 2398 relevant studies in a field synopsis of the biological invasions literature. A majority of these studies (58\%) were concerned with hypotheses for causes of biological invasions, while studies on impacts of invasions were the next most common (32\% of the publications). We examined 1537 papers in greater detail in a systematic review. Superior competitive abilities of invaders, environmental disturbance, and invaded community species richness were the most common hypotheses examined. Most studies examined only a single hypothesis. Almost half of the papers were field observational studies. Studies of terrestrial invasions dominate the literature, with most of these concerning plant invasions. The focus of the literature overall is uneven, with important gaps in areas of theoretical and practical importance.},

However, most receive relatively little training in how to do this effectively. Furthermore, evaluation of whether such an investment by ecologists actually achieves conservation objectives is rare. We created an education program, involving print, television, radio, and internet media, to increase awareness about earthworm invasions and to discourage anglers from dumping earthworm bait. Using pre- and post-surveys, we evaluated our program’s success in reaching its target audience and in changing knowledge and behavior. Few participants (4.1\%) recalled seeing the program material and knowledge of the fact that earthworms are non-native in Alberta remained low (15.8\% before, 15.1\% after). Further, after being told about the negative effects of earthworms in forests, 46.7\% of the anglers surveyed stated they would not change their bait disposal behavior in the future, with many commenting that they did not believe earthworms could be harmful. These results highlight the importance of evaluating education programs, rather than assuming they are successful. Given many participants’ doubts that earthworms have negative effects, both regulations and education may be needed to reduce earthworm introductions.},

	abstract = {The success of invading species can be restricted by interspecific interactions such as competition and predation (i.e. biotic resistance) from resident species, which may be natives or previous invaders. Whilst there are myriad examples of resident species preying on invaders, simply showing that such an interaction exists does not demonstrate that predation limits invader establishment, abundance or spread. Support for this conclusion requires evidence of negative associations between invaders and resident predators in the field and, further, that the predator-prey interaction is likely to strongly regulate or potentially de-stabilise the introduced prey population. Moreover, it must be considered that different resident predator species may have different abilities to restrict invaders. In this study, we show from analysis of field data that two European predatory freshwater amphipods,  Gammarus pulex  and  Gammarus duebeni celticus , have strong negative field associations with their prey, the invasive North American amphipod  Crangonyx pseudogracilis . This negative field association is significantly stronger with  Gammarus pulex , a previous and now resident invader in the study sites, than with the native  Gammarus duebeni celticus . These field patterns were consistent with our experimental findings that both resident predators display potentially population de-stabilising Type II functional responses towards the invasive prey, with a significantly greater magnitude of response exhibited by  Gammarus pulex  than by  Gammarus duebeni celticus . Further, these Type II functional responses were consistent across homo- and heterogeneous environments, contrary to the expectation that heterogeneity facilitates more stabilising Type III functional responses through the provision of prey refugia. Our experimental approach confirms correlative field surveys and thus supports the hypothesis that resident predatory invertebrates are differentially limiting the distribution and abundance of an introduced invertebrate. We discuss how the comparative functional response approach not only enhances understanding of the success or failure of invasions in the face of various resident predators, but potentially also allows prediction of population- and community-level outcomes of species introductions.},

Stressful conditions such as increasing temperature, particularly within high ranges occurring in the summer, have been suggested to induce flotation behaviour in Corbicula fluminea which may be important in dispersal of this invasive species. However, there has been no experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis. It was already proven that C. fluminea drift is supported by a mucilaginous drogue line produced by mucocytes present in the ctenidia. Detailed microscopic examination of changes in these cells and quantification of clam flotation following one, two and three weeks of exposure to 22, 25 and 30°C was carried out so that the effects of increasing water temperatures in dispersal patterns could be discussed. Results show that changes in temperature triggered an acceleration of the mucocytes production and stimulated flotation behaviour, especially following one week of exposure. Dilution of these effects occurred following longer exposure periods. It is possible that these bivalves perceive changing temperature as a stress and respond accordingly in the short-term, and then acclimate to the new environmental conditions. The response patterns suggest that increasing water temperatures could stimulate C. fluminea population expansion.},

We evaluated diet and foraging habitat selection by comparing aggregate percent dry mass of food items in shorebird diets and core samples from foraging substrates. Invertebrate abundances at shorebird collection sites and random sites were generally similar, indicating that birds did not select foraging patches within wetlands based on invertebrate abundance. Conversely, we found considerable evidence for selection of some diet items within particular foraging sites, and consistent avoidance of Oligochaeta. We suspect the diet selectivity we observed was a function of overall invertebrate biomass (51.2±4.4 [SE] kg/ha; dry mass) at our study sites, which was greater than estimates reported in most other food selection studies. Diet selectivity in shorebirds may follow tenants of optimal foraging theory; that is, at low food abundances shorebirds forage opportunistically, with the likelihood of selectivity increasing as food availability increases. Nonetheless, relationships between the abundance, availability, and consumption of Oligochaetes for and by waterbirds should be the focus of future research, because estimates of foraging carrying capacity would need to be revised downward if Oligochaetes are truly avoided or unavailable for consumption.},

	abstract = {There is widespread concern over the impact of introduced species on biodiversity, but the magnitude of these impacts can be variable. Understanding the impact of an introduced species is essential for effective management. However, empirical evidence of the impact of an introduced species can be difficult to obtain, especially when the impact is through competition. Change in species abundance is often slow and gradual, coinciding with environmental change. As a result, negative impacts on native species through competition are poorly documented. An example of the difficulties associated with obtaining empirical evidence of impact due to competition comes from work on the Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis). The species is listed in the World’s top 100 worst invaders, despite a lack of empirical evidence of its negative impacts on native species. We assessed the impact of the Common Myna on native bird abundance, using long-term data both pre and post its invasion. At the outset of our investigation, we postulated that Common Myna establishment would negatively affect the abundance of other cavity-nesting species and bird species that are smaller than it. We found a negative relationship between the establishment of the Common Myna and the long-term abundance of three cavity-nesting species (Sulphur-crested Cockatoo, Crimson Rosella, Laughing Kookaburra) and eight small bird species (Striated Paradoxes, Rufous Whistler, Willie Wagtail, Grey Fantail, Magpie-lark, House Sparrow, Silvereye, Common Blackbird). To the best of our knowledge, this finding has never previously been demonstrated at the population level. We discuss the key elements of our success in finding empirical evidence of a species impact and the implications for prioritisation of introduced species for management. Specifically, prioritization of the Common Myna for management over other species still remains a contentious issue.},

	abstract = {In recent years, species and ecosystems have been threatened by many anthropogenic factors manifested in local and global declines of populations and species. Although we consider conservation medicine an emerging field, the concept is the result of the long evolution of transdisciplinary thinking within the health and ecological sciences and the better understanding of the complexity within these various fields of knowledge. Conservation medicine was born from the cross fertilization of ideas generated by this new transdisciplinary design. It examines the links among changes in climate, habitat quality, and land use; emergence and re-emergence of infectious agents, parasites and environmental contaminants; and maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem functions as they sustain the health of plant and animal communities including humans. During the past ten years, new tools and institutional initiatives for assessing and monitoring ecological health concerns have emerged: landscape epidemiology, disease ecological modeling and web-based analytics. New types of integrated ecological health assessment are being deployed; these efforts incorporate environmental indicator studies with specific biomedical diagnostic tools. Other innovations include the development of non-invasive physiological and behavioral monitoring techniques; the adaptation of modern molecular biological and biomedical techniques; the design of population level disease monitoring strategies; the creation of ecosystem-based health and sentinel species surveillance approaches; and the adaptation of health monitoring systems for appropriate developing country situations. New Directions of Conservation Medicine: Applied Cases of Ecological Health addresses these issues with relevant case studies and detailed applied examples. New Directions of Conservation Medicine challenges the notion that human health is an isolated concern removed from the bounds of ecology and species interactions. Human health, animal health, and ecosystem health are moving closer together and at some point, it will be inconceivable that there was ever a clear division.},

The long-term impacts of species invasions are difficult to assess on ecological timescales available to biologists, but the fossil record provides analogues that allow investigation of the long-term impacts of species invasions. Two case studies of ancient invasions, the Late Devonian Biodiversity Crisis ({\textasciitilde}375million years ago) and the Late Ordovician Richmondian Invasion ({\textasciitilde}446 million years ago), provide insight into the effect of invasive species on extinction, speciation, and ecosystem structuring. During both intervals, invasive species are characterized by broad ecological tolerances, broad geographic ranges, and higher-than-average survival potential through the crisis interval. Among the native species, narrowly adapted ecological specialists are more likely to become extinct, while broadly-adapted generalist species persisted through the invasion interval by modifying aspects of their ecological niche through niche evolution. In addition, formation of new species practically stopped during the invasion intervals due to reduced opportunities for geographic isolation and speciation. The results of these impacts produced post-invasion biotas with less diversity, greater biotic homogenization between regions, and a lack of new species forming. Conservation efforts to eradicate invasive species may help mitigate these outcomes in the current biodiversity crisis.},

Many gray areas exist relating to the host physiological disturbances associated with these infections, and the strategies used by these parasites to exploit their host without killing it. The aim of this study was to examine the host exploitation strategies of these trematodes and the associated host physiological disturbances. We hypothesized that these two parasite species, by infecting two different organs (gills or gonads), do not induce the same physiological changes. Four cellular responses (lysosomal and peroxisomal defence systems, lipidic peroxidation and lipidic reserves) in the host digestive gland were studied by histochemistry and stereology, as well as the energetic reserves available in gonads. Moreover, two indices were calculated related to the reproductive status and the physiological condition of the organisms. Both parasites induced adjustments of zebra mussel life history traits. The host-exploitation strategy adopted by P. folium would occur during a short-term period due to gill deformation, and could be defined as “virulent.” Moreover, this parasite had significant host gender-dependent effects: infected males displayed a slowed-down metabolism and energetic reserves more allocated to growth, whereas females displayed better defences and would allocate more energy to reproduction and maintenance. In contrast, B. polymorphus would be a more “prudent” parasite, exploiting its host during a long-term period through the consumption of reserves allocated to reproduction.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a stochastic model used to characterize the probability/risk of NIS establishment from ships' ballast water discharges. Establishment is defined as the existence of a sufficient number of individuals of a species to provide for a sustained population of the organism. The inherent variability in population dynamics of organisms in their native or established environments is generally difficult to quantify. Much qualitative information is known about organism life cycles and biotic and abiotic environmental pressures on the population, but generally little quantitative data exist to develop a mechanistic model of populations in such complex environments. Moreover, there is little quantitative data to characterize the stochastic fluctuations of population size over time even without accounting for systematic responses to biotic and abiotic pressures. This research applies an approach using life-stage density and fecundity measures reported in research to determine a stochastic model of an organism's population dynamics. The model is illustrated with data from research studies on the green crab that span a range of habitats of the established organism and were collected over some years to represent a range of time-varying biotic and abiotic conditions that are expected to exist in many receiving environments. This model is applied to introductions of NIS at the IMO D-2 and the U.S. ballast water discharge standard levels designated as Phase Two in the United States Coast Guard's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Under a representative range of ballast volumes discharged at U.S. ports, the average rate of establishment of green crabs for ballast waters treated to the IMO-D2 concentration standard (less than 10 organisms/m3) is predicted to be reduced to about a third the average rate from untreated ballast water discharge. The longevity of populations from the untreated ballast water discharges is expected to be reduced by about 90\% by treatment to the IMO-D2 concentration standard.},

Resistance against an introduced fish can be through strong competition and/or predation from resident fishes. Here, the biotic resistance against introduced topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva (a highly invasive fish in Europe) by resident carp Cyprinus carpio was tested in experimental mesocosms. The introduction scenario was six adult P. parva (three male, three female) on a single occasion. Resistance to their establishment was provided by three and six resident C. carpio whose effects on P. parva growth and reproduction were compared to a Control (no resident fish at the time of introduction) and treatments containing three and six P. parva. After 120 days, the growth rates of the introduced P. parva were significantly depressed in C. carpio presence and in mesocosms with three C. carpio present, significantly decreased numbers of 0+P. parva were recorded. Where six C. carpio were present, no 0+P. parva were recorded, indicating resistance strength increased with carp abundance. In contrast, there were no differences in P. parva reproduction and growth rates between the Control and treatments containing conspecifics. Stable isotope analysis (δ15N, δ13C) revealed C. carpio were feeding at one trophic level above 0+P. parva, suggesting the process of resistance was predation (facultative piscivory) rather than competition. Thus, if P. parva are to establish and invade following an introduction, they must overcome this biotic resistance from cyprinid fishes such as C. carpio.},

	abstract = {To understand interactions of lake physical characteristics, trophic dynamics and climate in Lago Maggiore, we compare longterm limnological and meteorological monitoring data and results from sediment cores. We include analyses of nutrients, pigments, diatoms and cladoceran microfossils. Over the past decades, caloric content increased. Eutrophication from the 1960s to early 1980s was followed by oligotrophication. DDTs, PCBs and Hg showed high contamination in the ‘60s, compared to point source inputs in the ‘90s. Algal biomass was predicted by total pigments and some algal specific carotenoids. Following nutrient enrichment, Chydorus sphaericus, and total abundance of cladocerans changed inversely with trophic status. Fewer large Daphnia since the late ‘80s matched an increase in with subfossil Eubosmina mucro lengths. Both were explained by the 10-fold increase in Bythotrephes longimanus from 1987 to 1993, when an increase of its mean annual population density occurred during warmer winter and springs. Bythotrephes remained abundant and further increased during the following 10 years as water temperature increased. We conclude that warmer water affects food chains indirectly by changing habitat use and predator-prey interactions. Relative abundances of Daphnia and its peak population density in the warm year of the oligotrophic period (2003) were close to the record from the mesotrophic period in 1982, supporting the hypothesis that warming can produce a eutrophication-like signal. The study illustrates the complexity of biological responses to synchronous changes in multiple drivers (e.g., eutrophication, fish introduction, ban of fish harvesting, chemical pollution, and climate) and, despite this complexity, how Lago Maggiore responded to multiple stressors.},

The prevalence of L. fortunei, rather than the environmental variables, regulated the dynamics of the associated invertebrate fauna. The golden mussel alters both the structure and function of benthic native communities on hard substrates, allows a higher surface available for colonization and refuge, and provides food source to deposit-feeding organisms in the form of organic or residual material. The mussel also increases the abundance and diversity of taxa on hard substrata - such as Oligochaeta, Hirudinea, Tardigrada, Chironomidae, Copepoda, Tanaidacea, and Hydrachnidia. Similarities and nonparametric multidimensional-scaling analyses indicated that the benthic composition had a seasonal variation.

	abstract = {The filtration rate of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), as a sensitive biological end point, was used to evaluate the toxicity of lead and iron. Zebra mussels were exposed individually to serial levels of lead and iron (800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1800 μg L-1). The inhibition of filtration rate was determined after 24 h. The bioassay revealed that the effective concentration causing filtration inhibition 1\% (EC1filtration), 5\% (EC5filtration ), 10\% (EC10filtration), 50\% (EC50filtration) and 99\% (EC99filtartion) of Pb and Fe to D. polymorpha were 427.072, 601.310, 721.648, 1373.448, 4416.951 μg L-1 and 409.908, 571.420, 682.141, 1274.149 and 3960.532 μg L-1, respectively. The ECx values recorded for Fe were higher than those recorded for Pb. Therefore, Fe was found to be more toxic to zebra mussels than Pb. The interactive effect of these metals was examined by testing the inhibition of filtration rate of zebra mussels exposed to 1:1 mixture of Pb and Fe. It was established that their interaction was synergistic. The results show that D. polymorpha filtration rate can be a sensitive end-point for assessing ecological risk of Pb and Fe as environmental contaminants.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions are a significant area of research due to perceived negative environmental and economic impacts. The study of biological invasions has identified three broad components involved in successful invasions: propagule pressure, abiotic and biotic conditions. Propagule pressure is the product of introduced propagules and the frequency of those introductions, and is considered a driver in all stages of invasion. Data to quantify propagule pressure is often unavailable, and therefore, this research approached genetic information to produce estimates of propagule pressure in the successful invasion of cogongrass (Imperata cylindrica) in the United States.    The following research utilized molecular methodologies to estimate genetic diversity and to infer historical introductions. Population genetic analyses were conducted for the purpose of estimating extant population-level genetic diversity at multiple-scales to first address documented cogongrass introduction(s) into this country, followed by an exploration of substantial range expansion into seven states across the region. Lastly, this research explicitly seeks evidence to support interspecific hybridization between cogongrass and a co-occurring congeneric (Imperata brasiliensis) having occurred. Aggressive range expansion by cogongrass has been attributed to such a hybridization event, but has not yet been specifically tested.   Historical accounts of foreign introduction of cogongrass propagules identify two separate introductions of distinct source material made into Mississippi and Alabama. Localized population genetic analysis of these two states found substantial genetic variability within and among cogongrass populations, and supported a two-introduction scenario of distinct genetic source propagules establishing and subsequently intermixing. Enlarging the geographic scale of study incorporated five additional U.S. states currently experiencing and managing cogongrass invasion. Considerable genetic variability was found within and among the seven states surveyed. It was found that range expansion was unequal across the range, and that the most distant states tested were not genetically isolated from source populations, suggesting a possible anthropogenic role. Focusing solely on Florida where two congeners overlap ranges, morphology, and ecology, this population genetic analysis failed to detect significant evidence to support interspecific hybridization. Collectively, these investigations explored genome-level dynamics during invasion by a noteworthy invasive grass in an effort to better understand the process of biological invasions.},

Here we report on the application of LTS as a novel detection method for species-specific DNA where the presence of one invasive species was differentiated from a closely related invasive sister species. The method employs carboxylated polystyrene nanoparticles functionalized with short DNA fragments that are complimentary to a specific target DNA sequence. In solution, the DNA strands containing targets bind to the tags resulting in a sizable increase in the nanoparticle diameter, which is rapidly and quantitatively measured using LTS. DNA strands that do not contain the target sequence do not bind and produce no size change of the carboxylated beads. The results show that LTS has the potential to become a quantitative and rapid DNA detection method suitable for many real-world applications.},

	abstract = {The conservation of marine benthic biodiversity is a recognised goal of a number of national and international programs such as the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity (CBD). In order to attain this goal, information is needed about the distribution of life in the ocean so that spatial conservation measures such as marine protected areas (MPAs) can be designed to maximise protection within boundaries of acceptable dimensions. Ideally, a map would be produced that showed the distribution of benthic biodiversity to enable the efficient design of MPAs. The dilemma is that such maps do not exist for most areas and it is not possible at present to predict the spatial distribution of all marine life using the sparse biological information currently available. 
Knowledge of the geomorphology and biogeography of the seafloor has improved markedly over the past 10 years. Using multibeam sonar, the benthic ecology of submarine features such as fjords, sand banks, coral reefs, seamounts, canyons, mud volcanoes and spreading ridges has been revealed in unprecedented detail.
This book provides a synthesis of seabed geomorphology and benthic habitats based on the most recent, up-to-date information. Introductory chapters explain the drivers that underpin the need for benthic habitat maps, including threats to ocean health, the habitat mapping approach based on principles of biogeography and benthic ecology and seabed (geomorphic) classification schemes. Case studies from around the world are then presented. They represent a range of seabed features where detailed bathymetric maps have been combined with seabed video and sampling to yield an integrated picture of the benthic communities that are associated with different types of benthic habitat. The final chapter examines critical knowledge gaps and future directions for benthic habitat mapping research.

	abstract = {Processes of range expansion are increasingly important in light of current concerns about invasive species and range shifts due to climate change. Theoretical studies suggest that genetic structuring may occur during range expansion. Ephemeral genetic structure can have important evolutionary implications, such as propagating genetic changes along the wave front of expansion, yet few studies have shown evidence of such structure. We tested the hypothesis that genetic structure arises during range expansion in Hemidactylus mabouia, a nocturnal African gecko recently introduced to Florida, USA. Twelve highly variable microsatellite loci were used to screen 418 individuals collected from 43 locations from four sampling sites across Florida, representing a gradient from earlier (∼1990s) to very recent colonization. We found earlier colonized locations had little detectable genetic structure and higher allelic richness than more recently colonized locations. Genetic structuring was pronounced among locations at spatial scales of tens to hundreds of meters near the leading edge of range expansion. Despite the rapid pace of range expansion in this introduced gecko, dispersal is limited among many suitable habitat patches. Fine-scale genetic structure is likely the result of founder effects during colonization of suitable habitat patches. It may be obscured over time and by scale-dependent modes of dispersal. Further studies are needed to determine if such genetic structure affects adaptation and trait evolution in range expansions and range shifts.},

	abstract = {The suspension feeding bivalve Austrovenus stutchburyi is a key species on intertidal sandflats in New Zealand, affecting the appearance and functioning of these systems, but is susceptible to several environmental stressors including sedimentation. Previous studies into the effect of this species on ecosystem function have been restricted in space and time, limiting our ability to infer the effect of habitat change on functioning. We examined the effect of Austrovenus on benthic primary production and nutrient dynamics at two sites, one sandy, the other composed of muddy-sand to determine whether sedimentary environment alters this key species' role. At each site we established large (16 m2) plots of two types, Austrovenus addition and removal. In winter and summer we deployed light and dark benthic chambers to quantify oxygen and nutrient fluxes and measured sediment denitrification enzyme activity to assess denitrification potential. Rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ammonium uptake were significantly increased when Austrovenus was added, relative to removed, at the sandy site (GPP, 1.5 times greater in winter and summer; ammonium uptake, 8 times greater in summer; 3-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), p{\textless}0.05). Denitrification potential was also elevated in Austrovenus addition plots at the sandy site in summer (by 1.6 times, p{\textless}0.1). In contrast, there was no effect of Austrovenus treatment on any of these variables at the muddy-sand site, and overall rates tended to be lower at the muddy-sand site, relative to the sandy site (e.g. GPP was 2.1 to 3.4 times lower in winter and summer, respectively, p{\textless}0.001). Our results suggest that the positive effects of Austrovenus on system productivity and denitrification potential is limited at a muddy-sand site compared to a sandy site, and reveal the importance of considering sedimentary environment when examining the effect of key species on ecosystem function.},

	abstract = {As humans continue to encroach on wildlands, quality and quantity of wildlife habitat decreases before our eyes. A housing development here, a shopping mall there, a few more trees cut here, another road put in there, each of these diminishes available habitat. Unless the cumulative effects of multiple simultaneous development projects are recognized and incorporated at the beginning of project development, we will continue to see wildlife habitat disappear at unprecedented rates. Divided into two parts, Cumulative Effects in Wildlife Management emphasizes the importance of recognizing cumulative effects and highlights the necessity of their bearing on future policy. It begins with an outline of the differences between direct, indirect, and cumulative effects of anthropogenic impacts on wildlife habitat and addresses the similarities and differences in US and Canadian policies, legal and economic ramifications, and the confusion that stems from lack of consideration, communication, and forward planning. Section 1 also describes the current standard means of quantifying cumulative effects as proposed by the Council on Environmental Quality. Section 2 presents a series of case studies that deepen our appreciation of how anthropogenic influences interconnect and how this heightened level of understanding influences our ability to make informed decisions. Case studies include cumulative effects in the Canadian Arctic, border issues with Mexico, suburban and exurban landscapes, scenic resources, and the cumulative impacts of energy development on sage-grouse. Without a conscious knowledge of what is happening around us, we will not be able to incorporate an effective land ethic, and natural resources will be the ultimate loser. Cumulative Effects in Wildlife Management brings to light the crucial connections between human expansion and habitat destruction for those managers and practitioners charged with protecting wildlife in the face of changing landscapes.},

	abstract = {Food webs and the predators within them are changing with the influx of introduced species.  Increasing introductions have led to the accumulation of multiple introduced predators in many locations.  The study of interactions among introduced species is very much in its infancy and in Chapter 1, I used meta-analysis to frame what is currently known about these types of interactions.  I compared the magnitude of facilitative and antagonistic ISI on the performance of introduced species in their non-native ranges, and found that overall, antagonism and facilitation appear to be equivalent in their determination of introduced species success.  Within particular ecological contexts, however, antagonism or facilitation can dominate among introduced species, producing patterns of rapidly increasing introduced species accumulation as in invasional meltdown, or producing “Surprise effects” such as those first described on heavily invaded islands where management efforts were stymied due to cryptic interactions among introduced species.  Methods vary regarding detection of interactions among introduced species and the impacts of those interactions, and very few if any generalizations have yet been made regarding the role of introduced species interactions in altering the structure of native communities.     In chapter 2 I describe laboratory and field manipulations designed to determine whether the introduced cephalaspidaean Philine orientalis  interferes with the invasive predatory crab Carcinus maenas .  Laboratory and field investigations produced conflicting results.  In the laboratory, P. orientalis slowed predation of  C. maenas on the introduced gem clam Gemma gemma, likely due to the secretion of distasteful, defensive mucous by P. orientalis.  In the field, this suppression did not occur.  I used laboratory and field observations to parameterize a foraging model for  C. maenas in the presence of P. orientalis based on the Beddington-DeAngelis functional response equation.  This model revealed that crab foraging efficiency was likely to be the most important determining factor in whether or not suppression by P. orientalis alters the predatory impact of C. maenas on small clams like  G. gemma.  Foraging efficiency is predicted to decrease with increasing predator density.     In chapter 3, I investigated the potential for an emergent multiple predator effect between C. maenas and the native predatory crab  Cancer productus.  It was not clear whether an emergent effect exists between these two speices, but results indicated that risk reduction is a likely outcome of these predators being combined in the field.  Any negative effect of C. maenas on C. productus foraging, or vice versa, was a result of increased predator density, a common consequence of successful introduction of non-native predators.  The decrease of predator foraging efficiency at high predator densities could produce a situation in which additional interference from other organisms, such as that discussed in chapter 2, would become ecologically important.     Through meta-analysis and experimentation, this dissertation outlines how interaction webs and communities change with the influx of introduced predators via predator-predator interference.  I suggest that these changes can be highly context-specific, and therefore a multi-faceted approach is required to understand their true impact throughout a food web.  In this case, a potential route of interference was identified between P. orientalis  and  C. maenas that is likely to be mediated by a chemical defense of P. orientalis, a supposedly rare occurance in soft-bottom communities.  The ecological importance of this interference is predicted to change as crab foraging efficiency changes. These kinds of contextual details are a determining factor of the magnitude of the impact of new predator introductions on native communities.},

	abstract = {Although the Argentine ant has invaded most all the worlds regions with mediterranean and subtropical climates, several important aspects of its ecology are unpredictable: 1, its impact on seed dispersing ants, 2, its impact on nectar resources, and 3, the mechanisms that govern its spread through a landscape. I explored these aspects of the ant's ecology on the coast of central Chile and found 1. Argentine ants eliminate all native ants within fields and fragments of native forest except Solenopsis latastei.  2. While Solenopsis gayi and Pogonomyrmex ants remove seeds of 9/11 native plants from seed arenas, Argentine ants removed zero. 3. Flowers of the hummingbird pollinated Lobelia excelsa were strongly depleted of nectar by Argentine ants, but not by native ants. 4. Argentine ants are able to remove more nectar from L. excelsa chiefly because they persist at a much higher density than the native ants, and possibly because the most common native ants are too big to enter the nectar chamber of the flower. 5. Argentine ants invaded both hot dry fields and cool riparian sites. 6. Argentine ants invade the agro-ecological landscape by spreading through hedgerows and small clumps of native vegetation, and later invade overgrazed fields. 7. Until invaded, the dominant ant in these overgrazed fields (Solenopsis gayi) consumed seeds, and thus may have a trophic advantage over invading Argentine ants. 8. Argentine ants did not invade larger remnant forests ({\textgreater} 45m wide) that were often in ravines. I predict that Argentine ants will spread to most of the agro-ecosystems of the central coast of Chile. I propose that the spread of Argentine ants is limited by food availability, and that the hedgerows and patchy environments foster the ants invasion by fostering a variability in populations of insect prey, which the Argentine ant is adept at exploiting.},

	abstract = {Species distributions are affected by a myriad of factors both natural and human caused, including; geography, climate, habitat, elevation, competition, habitat fragmentation, and habitat destruction, to name a few. Additionally, though less frequently, species distributions are affected by human mediated movements. These actions can be intentional (e.g. salamanders used as bait), or inadvertent (e.g. Zebra mussels in the ballast of a boat), and affect both wild and domesticated species. The effects of such human-mediated movements can be cryptic, unless molecular genetic markers are used to detect breaks or differences in population genetic structure. Here, we use molecular markers to detect potential human-mediated movements of black bears (Chapter 1), domestic dogs in Southeast, Southwest Asia (Chapter 2) and in Africa (Chapter 3).   Microsatellite genotypes of 540 black bears (Ursus americanus ) were used to assess the population genetic structure in California (Chapter 1). In addition to revealing population genetic structure throughout the state, two colonization events were detected. One was a human-mediated movement of black bears from Yosemite National Park to the mountains of Southern California, several hundreds of miles away. Historical records corroborate this genetic finding, that 28 black bears were purposefully moved further south. The second event was a natural colonization event from the Southern Sierra Nevada, following an apparent competitive release in the Central Coast, since the time the California Grizzly (Ursus arctos californicus) went extinct.   Previous research with mitochondrial DNA and breed dogs has left the origins of the domestic dog, one of man’s closest companions, largely unknown. We used five Y chromosome STR and eleven SNP markers in village dogs from Southwest and Southeast Asia to assess the origins of dogs (Chapter 2). Mitochondrial and Y chromosome markers revealed a longer history of dogs in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, near monophyly between Southwest and Southeast Asia was revealed, with a corresponding Neolithic divergence date (10,000 – 16,000 BP). Southwest and Southeast Asia were found to be centers of diversification, with most modern (European breeds, Australian Dingo) stemming from the Southeast, and African and Southwest Asian breeds showing affinity to Southwest Asia. We then hypothesized that these regions served as regions from which humans, on their migratory routes, spread the domestic dog globally.   Like many domesticated species, the dog was introduced to Africa through human migrations. However, from where and when the dog arrived in Africa has remained unclear (Chapter 3). We applied Y chromosomal STR and SNP markers to African village dogs, in direct comparison to Southwest and Southeast Asia. We found African village dogs to derive from the Neolithic Period from both Southwest and Southeast Asia. Migrations of pastoralists from the Middle East likely brought dogs to North Africa in the Neolithic era. Similarly, Austronesian sailors from Southeast Asia are implicated in bringing dog (e.g. Dingoes) to Madagascar and East Africa.   This dissertation focused on detecting human mediated movements in a wild mammal, the black bear, and indigenous Old-world dogs. With genetic tools, we were able to reveal otherwise cryptic population genetic structure caused, most likely, by both a modern and ancient movement of black bears and dogs, respectively. The results provided by the black bear study could inform future translocations of black bears, with the purpose of conservation in mind. Finally, additional studies of village dogs need to be performed. Such studies will not only inform how and when dogs spread throughout the world, but how their human companions migrated as well. Studies using commensal animals have shown their importance in elucidating human movements.},

The aims of the current work were to experimentally study whether the habitat choice of G. tigrinus and G. salinus was similar and whether G. tigrinus modified the habitat selection of G. salinus, providing thus evidence that competition for space between the two species might explain the disappearance of the native gammarids from the study area. In general, the gammarid amphipods had a significant overlap in habitat selection. Gammarids modified the habitat choices of co-occurring species but impacts were disproportional among species. The effects of G. tigrinus on G. salinus were stronger than vice versa. However, the effects varied among months, and the negative responses were not observed in all habitats. Thus, competition for space alone cannot explain the mass disappearance of the native G. salinus.},

Today they number in the hundreds of millions and are taking over Australian habitats at 25 miles per year, spreading disease and killing native species as they go. Rogue Species explains the little-understood dangers of invasive species. Ranging from the zebra mussel (currently threatening the health of the Great Lakes) to the infamous kudzu vine (a Japanese import that now smothers seven million acres in the American southeast), these disastrous human blunders threaten the biodiversity on which all lifeincluding our owndepends.

	abstract = {Scuba diving is a popular recreational activity practiced all over the world in fresh and salt water bodies, but it can have damaging impacts on delicate aquatic environments. Unfortunately, many scuba divers lack knowledge of the marine ecosystem and environmentally responsible behaviors, which contributes to the ecological degradation of the environment. This paper examines the current educational materials available to new and experienced scuba divers through various outlets, and identifies gaps in important environmental training. Raising awareness through education and marketing, scuba divers could be inspired to learn and practice sustainable scuba diving. If divers know how their actions impact the environment, and are motivated to change destructive behaviors, we can effectively mitigate direct and indirect damage to the environment so scuba can be enjoyed by future generations.},

	abstract = {New York’s Adirondack Park is internationally recognized for its biological diversity. Greater in size than Yellowstone, Everglades, Glacier, and Grand Canyon National Park combined, the Adirondacks are the largest protected area within the Northern Appalachian/Acadian Eco-Region and within the contiguous United States. Ecologists, residents of the Park, and others are concerned about rapid land use change occurring within the borders of the Park. Almost half of the six million acres encompassed by the Park boundary is privately-owned, where 80\% of land use decisions fall within the jurisdiction of local governments. The comprehensive planning process of one such local government, the Town of Willsboro, New York, was the focus of a Participatory Action Research (PAR), single case study. Using a PAR, mixed methods approach, community-led comprehensive planning integrated natural science, technology and citizen participation. I evaluated the role of PAR in helping to transform conventional land use planning practice into a more democratic, environmentally conscious, and durable civic responsibility. Stakeholder viewpoints about the local environmental setting revealed deep connections to nature. Findings of the research indicate that comprehensive land use planning capacity increases when citizens increase their scientific and ecological literacy, especially when tools such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are used for data collection and analysis. Applying ecologically-based comprehensive planning utilizing a PAR framework improved citizen’s confidence in land use decision-making and also expanded science literacy. PAR holds great promise as a methodological framework to bring together ecologically-focused natural science with citizen-led collaborative land use planning. Areas of further research identified during this study include assessing age-specific gaps in stakeholder participation, evaluating the relationship between plan recommendations and regulatory implementation, and investigating factors that contribute to a culture of community engagement. Local land use planning decisions have important cumulative impacts on protected area land development at the local and regional scale. A comprehensive plan can reflect an emergent process, where the primacy of community self-determination and consensus-building yields recognition of the link between, and sanctity of, nature, home, and homeland.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions are one of the strongest drivers of global environmental change, and invasive species are now often in the public discourse. At the same time, economists have begun to take a real interest in determining how invasive species interact with economic systems, and how invaders should be controlled to optimize societal wealth. Although the work from ecologists and economists have both greatly expanded our understanding of the drivers and impacts of invasions, little integration between the fields has occurred that would allow managers and policy-makers to identify the optical expenditures on, for example, prevention and control of invasive species. Because the level of effort expended on invasive species management is intricately linked to the costs and projected benefits of that management, there is an urgent need for greater synthesis between ecology and economics.This book brings ecology and economics together in new ways to address how we deal with the dynamics and impacts of invasive species, and is the outcome fo many years of collaborative research between a small group of economists and ecologists. The outcome is clear demonstration of the utility of combining ecological and economic models for addressing critical questions in the management of invasive species.},

Yet this is the first synthetic, single-authored overview of the field since Williamson's 1996 book. Written fifty years after the publication of Elton's pioneering monograph on the subject, Invasion Biology provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of the science of biological invasions while also offering new. insights and perspectives relating to the processes of introduction, establishment, and spread. The book connects science with application by describing the health, economic, and ecological impacts of invasive species as well as the variety of management strategies developed to mitigate harmful impacts. The. author critically evaluates the approaches, findings, and controversies that have characterized invasion biology in recent years, and suggests a variety of future research directions. Carefully balanced to avoid distinct taxonomic, ecosystem, and geographic (both investigator and species) biases, the book addresses a wide range of invasive species (including protists, invertebrates, vertebrates, fungi, and plants) which have been studied in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments. throughout the world by investigators equally diverse in their origins. This accessible and thought-provoking text will be of particular interest to graduate level students and established researchers in the fields of invasion biology, community ecology, conservation biology, and restoration ecology. It will also be of value and use to land managers, policy makers, and other professionals charged with controlling the negative impacts associated with recently arrived species. -},

In some cases these new arrivals have catastrophically altered freshwater ecosystems throughout much of North America. This study investigates the role of science in recognizing and mitigating the ecological risks posed by alien aquatic species present in transoceanic ballast water. It explores the reasons why scientists failed for so long to identify this threat and it explores constraints facing the scientific community once this threat was finally recognized. Exploring these topics involves analysis of the historical record between 1953 and 2008, which reveals that a small group of concerned scientists missed the ecological threats associated with foreign ballast water in 1955. This analysis also shows that taxonomic difficulties, rapid scientific growth, gross water pollution problems, changing political winds, as well as eroding scientific methods and dramatically reduced research budgets all worked to constrain efforts at stemming the flow of alien species in more modern times. With respect to aquatic invasive species, this thesis reveals that an effective link between science and the responsible legislative bodies associated with two federal governments was essentially nonexistent until 2006. As a consequence, we have forever altered the biological and evolutionary trajectories of the largest freshwater ecosystems on earth in full view of the scientific and regulatory communities charged with protecting them.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions have become increasingly common in our globalized society. An important goal of invasion research is to understand how the successful establishment of invasive species can both affect and be affected by the diversity of recipient communities. In chapter one, I introduce my study system and several important concepts in invasion ecology that are addressed by this dissertation. In chapter two, I use the framework of the "invasion paradox" to examine the relationship between the establishment of high densities of the introduced New Zealand mud snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) and native community diversity and structure across a range of aquatic systems. Within a highly invaded estuarine system, I examine interactions between this snail and native consumers to better understand the competitive impacts of this species (chapter three). Finally in chapter four, I address the direct and indirect interactions between this snail, predators, and their native prey. Across multiple regions, the highest densities of  P. antipodarum were found in systems with lower diversity and density of native invertebrates, however within river systems, there was no correlation between the density of mud snails and native diversity or density. There was no evidence for a negative impact of P. antipodarum on a native estuarine species that overlaps with mud snails in resource use. However, there was evidence for both direct trophic interactions between P. antipodarum and native predators, and indirect effects, in the form of asymmetrical apparent competition with native prey. Indirect effects such as these are less frequently studied but can be important in structuring communities, and demonstrate the complexity of determining the impact of a given invader. Like many successful invasive species, Potamopyrgus antipodarum are tolerant of a wide-range of environmental conditions, allowing them to invade many different habitat types. It is likely that the factors influencing both the success and impact of P. antipodarum differ between these types of communities, and further research into the long-term, multitrophic effects of this introduced species is important.},

	abstract = {In their fine paper, Evans et al. (2009) discuss the proposition that invasive non-native species (INS) are harmful. The question to ask is, "Harmful to whom?" Pathogens that make people sick and pests that damage their property--crops, for example--cause harms of kinds long understood in common law and recognized by public agencies. The concept of "harm to the environment," in contrast, has no standing in common law or legislation, no meaning for any empirical science, and no basis in a political consensus other than might be drawn from the Endangered Species Act. As a generalization, the proposition that INS cause "environmental harm"--since this concept is empty of legal, scientific, and political meaning--must rest on definition, diktat, or diatribe. As Evans et al. suggest, however, the idea of "harm to the environment" is not always and certainly need not be arbitrary; it might gather significance in the context of a particular place through a political process that weighs economic concerns with cultural, religious, aesthetic, and other relevant beliefs, practices, and commitments that people who care about that place present. It is not clear, however, that adaptive management, which Evens et al. propose, will provide that democratic political process. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {What factors shape the evolution of invasive populations? Recent theoretical and empirical studies suggest that an evolutionary history of disturbance might be an important factor. This perspective presents hypotheses regarding the impact of disturbance on the evolution of invasive populations, based on a synthesis of the existing literature. Disturbance might select for life‐history traits that are favorable for colonizing novel habitats, such as rapid population growth and persistence. Theoretical results suggest that disturbance in the form of fluctuating environments might select for organismal flexibility, or alternatively, the evolution of evolvability. Rapidly fluctuating environments might favor organismal flexibility, such as broad tolerance or plasticity. Alternatively, longer fluctuations or environmental stress might lead to the evolution of evolvability by acting on features of the mutation matrix. Once genetic variance is generated via mutations, temporally fluctuating selection across generations might promote the accumulation and maintenance of genetic variation. Deeper insights into how disturbance in native habitats affects evolutionary and physiological responses of populations would give us greater capacity to predict the populations that are most likely to tolerate or adapt to novel environments during habitat invasions. Moreover, we would gain fundamental insights into the evolutionary origins of invasive populations.},

In 1997 and 2003, the SCDNR deployed two designed concrete reefs off the coast of Charleston, SC, for use in fishing experiments. This study was conducted to assess the development of epifaunal invertebrate assemblages on both the younger ("Area 53"—2 years old) and older ("Area 51"—8 years old) reefs. Each artificial reef was also compared to an adjacent natural reef, "Julian's Ledge", in an attempt to determine whether designed structures can form habitats that resemble natural hard-bottom areas over time.    Macrofaunal invertebrates from each of the three reef sites were collected during Spring/Summer 2005. A total of 24,940 individuals were found, comprising at least 384 motile and sessile species. Cluster analysis revealed that species composition between reef sites was distinct, with Julian's Ledge displaying higher species number and diversity; however, evidence for convergence over time included a large group of species common to all three sites, and a higher level of similarity between Julian's Ledge and Area 51 than between Julian's Ledge and Area 53. Additional sampling at a later time period could help to elucidate whether these trends may be attributed to reef age, or other environmental variables. This study provided the first catalogue of invertebrate data for any of South Carolina's designed experimental artificial reefs.},

To address this issue, I present a framework for simulating the violation-enforcement relationship, in which the output is the proportion of vessels that violate ballast water regulations. I apply the simulated violation results to a simple dose-response model to evaluate the relative importance of the relationship between violation rate and invasion rate. Results demonstrate that the benefit of improving (or even accurately quantifying) the violation rate is highly dependent on the biological uncertainty in the relationship between ballast water and establishment of invasive species. As for minimizing the violation rate, the best allocation of an enforcement budget is robust to the model assumptions explored here.},

	abstract = {Parasite communities were examined from spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius (Clinton, 1824)) collected from nine localities in the St. Lawrence River around the Island of Montréal and downstream from its municipal effluents in June and September 1998-2000. A total of 30 taxa were found, the most common being Diplostomum spp. Parasite communities were dominated by digeneans, most of which were larval stages that infect birds as definitive hosts. Mean abundance of the most common parasites varied among localities and years. Component community and mean infracommunity species richness fluctuated within and among years at the various localities. Similarity analyses demonstrated that parasite component communities from the different localities could be partitioned according to season, year, and water mass. Canonical correspondence analysis demonstrated that the parasite component communities from the different localities could be distinguished clearly, indicating that the fish in the different localities compose separate populations or stocks. Year, season, and water mass correlated most strongly among the species-environment relationships. The abundance and distribution of parasite species appeared to be subtly influenced by environmental contaminants and urban effluents, leading to slight reductions in parasite diversity. However, the parasite species composition at the various localities more clearly reflected the local food-web structure and biodiversity in terms of the distributions of various invertebrate groups, piscivorous fish, and waterfowl along the St. Lawrence River.

	abstract = {The importance of habitat conservation for the protection of birds has become widely acknowledged and accepted by natural resource managers and the general public. Papers presented in this volume further our understanding of the important role that limnology has in determining habitat suitability for waterbirds. Long-term population monitoring of waterbirds is an important tool in our quest to understand the role waterbirds play in their environment. Continued population declines of many species of aquatic birds indicate the need for additional understanding of how human activities negatively impact water quality and bird populations and what mitigative actions can be taken. 
The main objective of the Working Group on Aquatic Birds of the International Limnological Society (SIL) is to integrate waterbirds into hydrobiology and treat waterbird studies in a limnological context. To achieve this goal, the Working Group organizes conferences to facilitate communications among limnologists interested in aquatic birds and ornithologists interested in the aquatic habitat. The efforts of the SIL Working Group on aquatic birds has resulted in a new emphasis on the links between aquatic birds and their environment.
This book is international in scope and presents information on species as diverse as common loon, harlequin duck, and semi-palmated sandpiper, and locations ranging from Iceland to Japan.International and multi-species content Discussion of waterbirds in a limnological context},

	abstract = {The dreissenid mussel invasion of Lake Michigan during the 1990s has been linked to a concomitant decrease in the abundance of the amphipod Diporeia. We tracked the seasonal energy dynamics of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) in Lake Michigan during 2002-2004 and compared our findings with previously published results for years 1979-1981. Adult alewife energy density exhibited a pronounced seasonal cycle during both the pre-invasion and post-invasion periods, with energy density in October or November nearly twice as high as that in early summer. However, on average, adult alewife energy density was 23\% lower during the post-invasion period compared with the pre-invasion period. This significant decline in energy density was attributable to decreased importance of Diporeia in adult alewife diet. In contrast, energy density of juvenile alewives did not significantly differ between the pre-invasion and post-invasion periods. To attain a weight of 8 kg by age 4, bioenergetics modeling indicated that a Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in Lake Michigan would have to consume 22.1\% more alewives during the post-invasion period compared with the pre-invasion period.

	abstract = {Benthic surveys were conducted in the southern basin of Lake Michigan and throughout the lake to assess trends in benthic populations, emphasizing recent changes in densities of the benthic amphipod Diporeia spp. and dreissenid mussels. In the southern basin, Diporeia populations declined 89\%, 91\%, and 45\% between 1993 and 2002 at sites {\textless}30, 31-50, and 51-90 m, respectively. Lakewide, the population declined 65\% between 1994-1995 and 2000. Over the same time period, dreissenid densities, particularly Dreissena bugensis, increased. Intensive studies at 45 m sites in the southeastern region examined changes in lipid content, age structure, and benthic food inputs relative to the hypothesis that food limitation was a factor in Diporeia's disappearance. As Diporeia densities declined to zero, length-weight remained unchanged, and lipid content generally increased. Recruitment still occurred, but the young did not survive to become adults. Based on organic carbon, biogenic silica, and chlorophyll collected in sediment traps and found in the upper sediments, pelagic inputs to the benthic region still occurred. Our field observations and laboratory experiments did not disprove the hypothesis that food limitation from dreissenid filtering activities was the cause of the decline, but direct relationships between the loss of Diporeia and indicators of food availability were difficult to establish.

Effects during the construction period may be minimized to a negligible impact if care is taken to avoid areas containing rare habitats or species. Disturbance caused by noise, vibrations, and electromagnetic fields during windmill operation may, with present knowledge, be considered to be of minor importance to the marine environment. The reef effect (i.e. addition of a hard substratum), is believed to cause the largest impact on the marine environment and at different scales: the micro scale, which involves material, texture, and heterogeneity of the foundation material; the meso scale, which involves the revetments and scour protection; and the macro scale, which encompasses the level of the entire windmill farm. Effects on these scales are discussed in relation to results obtained from natural habitats, artificial reefs, and other man-made constructions at sea. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {I investigated movement patterns and foraging effort of surf scoters wintering in two sites with shellfish aquaculture, one with clam and the other with mussel prey. Scoters at the clam site exhibited very little movement and high site fidelity, whereas scoters in the mussel habitats exhibited much larger movements. These habitat-specific movement patterns were likely related to temporal patterns of prey availability; clams remained relatively stable while mussels declined dramatically, depleted by scoters. Mussels occurring on aquaculture structures were novel prey favoured by foraging sea ducks because they occurred in higher densities with less defensive morphology than intertidal mussels. Surf scoters did not respond to depletion of these mussels by intensifying foraging efforts but rather moved to alternate feeding areas. Though shellfish aquaculture has modified habitats in coastal British Columbia, these changes have not compromised scoter foraging opportunities and, in some cases, have improved the availability and quality of prey.

	abstract = {The study of plant invasions is the science that attempts to understand causes and consequences of plant introductions outside of their native areas. Invasive plants have an impact on global biodiversity and ecosystem function, and their management is a complex and formidable task. The applied aspects of this study include the health and economic impacts of invasions. Although research on plant invasions has progressed remarkably during the past several decades, scientists are still looking for answers to basic questions. Such questions are: (1) What are invaders? (2) Can we predict invaders? (3) What are mechanisms of exclusion of native species by invaders? (4) How general principles in ecology can be used to predict and understand plant invasions? (5) What makes a habitat susceptible to invasion? (6) What agricultural practices influence invasion? (7) What impact invaders may have on ecosystem processes and community structure? (8) What are causes, mechanisms and consequences of plant invasions (9) What are the environmental and economic costs of invasion? (10) What management strategies are needed to check invasion? In an effort to answer these questions, contributing authors have strived to provide up-to-date reviews and discussions of invasion-related research involving natural and agroecosystems. Readers will get a unique perspective on ecological and agricultural aspects of plant invasions through employing general principles of ecology to plant invasions.A timely topic receiving increased attention Selected papers from an international symposium at the University of Delhi, India International and experienced authorshipAbout the Editor

	abstract = {The Eurasian amphipod Echinogammarus ischnus is reportedly replacing the common native amphipod Gammarus fasciatus in the Great Lakes - St. Lawrence River system. A potential mechanism for this replacement is competition mediated by resident species. Other Eurasian invaders, dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis), dominate rocky substrates throughout the system and might be promoting the rapid expansion of E. ischnus by providing habitat and refugia from predation. Using an in-situ predator-exclusion experiment, we tested the hypothesis that E. ischnus is better able than G. fasciatus to use Dreissena spp. colonies as refugia and thus is less susceptible to predators in the St. Lawrence River. Co-occurring E. ischnus and G. fasciatus showed similar increases in density in the presence of Dreissena spp., in spite of E. ischnus having evolutionary experience with Dreissena spp. Predators reduced the density of both amphipod species, but E. ischnus was more susceptible to predation on dreissenid substrates, which suggests that predation mediates the coexistence of G. fasciatus and E. ischnus in the river.

Manila and varnish clams were the predominant prey of both scoter species. Manila clams decreased in density over the winter period, while pronounced declines were not detected for varnish clam density. Estimates of clam consumption by scoters accounted for most of observed declines in combined abundance of Manila and varnish clams. Clam capture success of both scoter species and foraging effort of Surf Scoters were unrelated to variation in clam density, while White-winged Scoter foraging effort was negatively related to clam density. Observed clam densities were apparently high enough to not elicit strong behavioral shifts in foraging scoters. Further, scoters rarely foraged at night, sufficiently meeting energetic requirements during diurnal hours. These combined results suggest that Baynes Sound constituted high-quality winter habitat in which scoters were not constrained by food availability.},

	abstract = {We used an acoustic Doppler profiler to investigate the hydrodynamics of a nearshore site in western Lake Erie, and we incorporated the measured parameters in numerical simulations of phytoplankton consumption by benthic zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) to examine the link between pelagic production and benthic filter feeders. Daily-averaged eddy diffusivities varied from 10{\textasciicircum}sup -5{\textasciicircum} to 10{\textasciicircum}sup -4{\textasciicircum} m{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum}.s{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum} at our site. Our simulations demonstrate that diffusivities of this order decrease near-bed algal biomass, while algal biomass in the pelagic remains relatively unaffected. Between 8\% and 67\% of the algal biomass in the water column could be consumed daily, depending on the shape and magnitude of the diffusivity profile. Correspondingly, in situ vertical biomass profiles showed a near-bed zone of algal depletion, but no impact was observed near the surface. The impact of the zebra mussel in nearshore regions is expected to be stronger than in deeper open water. The flow of algal biomass into the benthos was tightly coupled with turbulent mixing, suggesting that open water algal consumption by zebra mussels is small compared with previously published estimates that ignored vertical turbulent mixing processes.

A multi-site survey in the river between Lake Ontario and Montreal (Quebec) found that E. ischnus and G. fasciatus respond differently to substrate characteristics, water chemistry variables, and current velocity. Both species increase in abundance in the presence of dreissenid mussels. However, E. ischnus density is positively correlated with current velocity and an increasing proportion of gravelsized sediment, while G. fasciatus density is positively correlated with benthic filamentous algal (Cladophora spp.) biomass, macrophyte biomass, and pH. Habitat heterogeneity within the river may be promoting the coexistence of native and exotic amphipods by allowing them to segregate along physicochemical gradients. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {Understanding the entire life history, especially critical periods during the life cycle of a species, is important for understanding population dynamics and is crucial for control of nuisance species. Errors in estimates of growth rates and recruitment in field and modeling studies are likely to occur if one assumes uniform rather than size- or stage-specific mortalities for larval stages. Similarly, effects of brood-stock health on adult fecundity and larval mortality patterns might affect results of laboratory studies investigating larval life history. We maintained zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771), in spawning condition in the laboratory for 24 weeks. Healthy larvae were produced for 18 weeks. However, induction of spawning and egg production declined through time. Fecundity increased with size per female, but sperm production did not for males. We found no correlation between clutch size and egg size across a wide range of clutch sizes. Survivorship was greater when larvae were reared at lower densities. Daily larval mortality was strongly size dependent; the average size of dead larvae was similar to the minimum size of live larvae. Highest daily larval mortality occurred during the transition from D stage to umbonal stage, supporting the suggestion of a developmental bottleneck as found in previous field studies.

	abstract = {Dreissenid mussels have been exceptionally successful invaders in North American lakes and rivers, especially in the lower Laurentian Great Lakes. As benthic filter feeders capable of attaching to hard substrates, the magnitudes of their biomass and filtering activity in nearshore waters are without precedent. The dreissenid colonization has implications for the removal and fate of materials filtered from the water by the mussels and for the longer-term development of the nearshore benthic community and lake ecosystem. A conceptual model, the nearshore shunt, seeks to describe a fundamental redirection of nutrient and energy flow consequent to dreissenid establishment. The model explains some emergent problems in the Great Lakes, such as reemergence of Cladophora in some coastal zones while offshore P concentrations remain low, and highlights areas in need of more research. The source of particulate nutrient inputs to dreissenids and the fate of materials exported from the benthic community are critical to understanding the role of dreissenids in the lakes and assessing the applicability of current models for managing nutrients and fisheries. The nearshore shunt would require even more stringent P management for lakes strongly impacted by dreissenids to maintain nearshore water quality. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

"We have to allow the lakes to heal," Nalbone told Osprey News Network. "The lakes are ecosystems. They will sooner or later stabilize, but they'll probably be different than the lakes we knew 100 years ago because so many species have been reduced or extirpated and so many new species have entered. The lakes will find a stable state if we stop stressing them out."


The invasive species compete with domestic species for food and reproduce at an alarming rate with few natural predators to reduce their numbers. Beaches, white with the crushed shells of zebra and quagga mussels, are evidence of the out-of-control breeding rates. Nalbone, who specializes in invasive species for the coalition, said most of the alien species are bottom feeders.},

Laboratory experiments were conducted in which veligers were subjected to turbulence due to a bubble plume and the rate of dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy was measured directly. The ratio d* of the shell size and the Kolmogorov length, the size of the smallest eddy in the velocity field, is introduced to quantitatively assess whether turbulence can affect larvae. The laboratory experiments show that mortality increases when d* exceeds 0.9, that is, when the size of the larvae is comparable with or larger than the smallest eddy. The laboratory results are used to show that turbulence can increase veliger mortality in streams and to evaluate the possibility of using bubble screens as a dispersal barrier to control zebra mussels in rivers. If the mortality is due to acute effects of turbulence (taken to be exposure on the order of minutes), the control scheme would work, but if the mortality is due to longer-term exposure, using bubble screens would not be practical.

	abstract = {Since completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, at least 43 nonindigenous species (NIS) of animals and protists have established in the Laurentian Great Lakes, of which {\textasciitilde}67\% were attributed to discharge of ballast water from commercial ships. Twenty-three NIS were first discovered in four "hotspot" areas with a high representation of NIS, most notably the Lake Huron - Lake Erie corridor. Despite implementation of the voluntary (1989, Canada) and mandatory (1993, U.S.A.) ballast water exchange (BWE) regulations, NIS were discovered at a higher rate during the 1990s than in the preceding three decades. Here we integrate knowledge of species' invasion histories, shipping traffic patterns, and physicochemical factors that constrain species' survivorship during ballast-mediated transfer to assess the risk of future introductions to the Great Lakes. Our risk-assessment model identified 26 high-risk species that are likely to survive intercontinental transfer in ballast tanks. Of these, 10 species have already invaded the Great Lakes. An additional 37 lower-risk species, of which six have already invaded, show some but not all attributes needed for successful introduction under current BWE management. Our model indicates that the Great Lakes remain vulnerable to ship-mediated NIS invasions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

	abstract = {We examined stressors that have led to profound ecological changes in the Lake Ontario ecosystem and its fish community since 1970. The most notable changes have been reductions in phosphorus loading, invasion by Dreissena spp., fisheries management through stocking of exotic salmonids and control of sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), and fish harvest by anglers and double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus). The response to these stressors has led to (i) declines in both algal photosynthesis and epilimnetic zooplankton production, (ii) decreases in alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) abundance, (iii) declines in native Diporeia and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), (iv) behavioral shifts in alewife spatial distribution benefitting native lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) populations, (v) dramatic increases in water clarity, (vi) predation impacts by cormorants on select fish species, and (vii) lake trout recruitment bottlenecks associated with alewife-induced thiamine deficiency. We expect stressor responses associated with anthropogenic forces like exotic species invasions and global climate warming to continue to impact the Lake Ontario ecosystem in the future and recommend continuous long-term ecological studies to enhance scientific understanding and management of this important resource.

While the mussels are a prime suspect, there may be other contributing factors to the problem.

	abstract = {Researchers have a "working hypothesis" that "the basic ecosystem of the lake has been significantly modified" by the presence of quagga mussels, an invasive species related to the zebra mussel, [Gerald Matisoff] said.


During their digestion process, the mussels suck organic matter out of the lake and expel the phosphorus contained in their food. The phosphorus enhances the growth of algae, which drains oxygen from the deep waters of the lake. Other organic matter expelled by the mussels decomposes on the lake bottom, consuming more oxygen in the process.


While the mussels are a prime suspect, there may be other contributing factors to the problem. For instance, the water levels in the Great Lakes have been dropping, which could be changing the chemistry of the water. In addition, Matisoff said, it is possible that sewage and agricultural runoff are depositing more nutrients into the lake than EPA data suggests.},

The killer bee, for instance. It was a pioneering eco-hazard, at least in modern times. It was brilliantly conceived, if the goal was to create widespread panic (which, of course, it couldn't have been, since this story, far from being tabloid fare, has been pursued vigorously by all the major news organizations). Half prolific honey bee, half aggressive Argentinian variety, the prototype killer bee escaped from a lab in South America two decades ago and began its relentless flight north. It still buzzes fitfully through the back pages, still attacks the odd Mexican field hand, but, for the most part, has been displaced by increasingly exotic and bizarre successors.},

Dominant invasion vectors include unintentional introductions via ballast water, tank sediments, and hull fouling, aquaculture, and the construction of canals that have facilitated active or passive natural dispersal. Of the approximately 60 unintentionally introduced species with a known invasion history, 38 are transoceanic (including 19 Atlantic species of American origin) and 18 of Ponto-Caspian origin. Species that have caused economic damage to fisheries, shipping, and industry include the hydrozoan Cordylophora caspia, the barnacle Balanus improvisus, the cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi, and the bivalve Dreissena polymorpha. The Baltic Sea has served as a secondary source of nonindigenous species to the North American Great Lakes.

Sixteen Ponto-Caspian species were also established in the Baltic Sea as of 2000. Many Ponto-Caspian endemic species are characterized by wide environmental tolerances and high phenotypic variability. Ponto-Caspian fauna evolved over millions of years in a series of large lakes and seas with widely varying salinities and water levels and alternating periods of isolation and open connections between the Caspian Sea and Black Sea depressions and between these basins and the Mediterranean Basin and the World Ocean. These conditions probably resulted in selection of Ponto-Caspian endemic species for the broad environmental tolerances and euryhalinity many exhibit. Both the Baltic Sea and the Great Lakes are geologically young and present much lower levels of endemism. The high tolerance of Ponto-Caspian fauna to varying environmental conditions, their ability to survive exposure to a range of salinities, and the similarity in environmental conditions available in the Baltic Sea and Great Lakes probably contribute to the invasion success of these species. Human activities have dramatically increased the opportunities for transport and introduction and have played a catalytic role.},

Important trade harbours in Europe were connected via these corridors allowing further range extensions of macroinvertebrate species attached to a vessel's hull or in ballast water. The central corridor was the main migration route before 1992, after which the southern corridor became the most important migration route for the range expansions to the west because of the reopening of the Main-Danube Canal, connecting the Rhine and Danube basins. Especially the water level maintenance in the upper part of the canal, with water supply from the Danube basin, facilitated migration of mobile animals (e.g., crustaceans) from the Danube basin towards the Rhine basin; however, contribution of other transport mechanisms (e.g., shipping) is expected in the near future.},

In this paper we review existing invasion models, most of which were developed to describe invasions of terrestrial habitats, and propose an alternative that explores long-distance invasions mediated by discharge of contaminated ballast water by ships inbound to the Great Lakes. Based on current knowledge of shipping traffic to the Great Lakes, our model predicts that mid-ocean exchange of ballast water lowers propagule delivery by approximately three to four orders of magnitude relative to unexchanged ballast water. Propagule pressure of individual ships that enter the Great Lakes loaded with cargo and that declare "no ballast on board" (NOBOB) is typically one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of vessels that exchange ballast. Because NOBOB vessels dominate ({\textasciitilde}90\%) inbound traffic into the Great Lakes, these vessels collectively appear to pose the greatest risk of new introductions, even though their individual risks are low.},

Along the 30-kilometre stretch of the Rideau River under study, Dreissena polymorpha annihilated all the native mussels- previously present in hundreds of thousands and three separate species, the eastern elliptio, the common floater and the eastern lampmussel.                 This attaching is the key difference between Dreissena polymorpha and native Canadian freshwater mussels. Our freshwater mussels will often burrow into sand, mud or silt. But unlike Canadian saltwater mussels, they lack any means to attach themselves permanently to structures, rocks, boats or other shellfish. When necessary, they can move several metres in a day, by extending a "foot" of their soft body, wedging it into the river bottom and then contracting a powerful muscle to drag the shell along.                 Yet the native mussels can't move or live normally when they're coated with hundreds of zebra mussels. The zebra mussels may be tiny, smaller across than a dime, but their combined mass means the native mussel is now trying to drag around two or three times its own weight. Nor can the encrusted native mussel remain upright in the river, a position essential for filtering the water through siphons to feed.},

	abstract = {In British Columbia, Surf Scoters (Melanitta perspicillata) are the most numerous wintering sea duck, however, population data collected over the past 50 years indicate that their numbers are declining.    Using captured specimens, plumage appearance was found to be concordant with known age-related features (bursal depth and tail feather notching) in 91\% of samples (n = 99), suggesting that reliable determinations can be made for up to three male age classes in the field. Seasonal timing is also an important consideration for obtaining representative counts.    I found first year male Surf Scoters did not segregate from adults by forming subadult flocks or foraging in different habitats. However, sexual habitat segregation was evident, with more males in sandy substrate habitats and females in rocky habitats. Foraging data suggest that habitat specialization rather than male dominance behavior underlies the segregation of the sexes. In sandy habitats, males handled clams in less time than females and spent a greater proportion of their time budget foraging. In rocky habitats, females completed dive cycles more quickly, giving them higher intake rates when feeding on mussels. Large sample sizes, which represent the range of available habitats, are necessary if sex ratio and age structure estimates are to pertain to the larger population.    Over the three years of this study, the average male Surf Scoter age ratio was 10.2\% (range = 6.0–13.5\%) first year males/total males in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia. Annual survival rates among adult males as high as 90\% are unlikely, suggesting low recruitment may be a cause for conservation concern. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)},

	abstract = {In rocky intertidal habitats located in Burrard Inlet and Howe Sound, British Columbia, wintering surf scoters (Melanitta perspicillata ) forage in large aggregations feeding preferentially on bay mussels (Mytilus trossulus), which grow in discrete, densely-packed beds. Regular boat-based surveys revealed that flocks of surf scoters systematically visited and abandoned a sequence of foraging sites in the course of a winter. By monitoring individual sites, I found that a mussel bed was completely stripped over a short period of time, evidently a matter of days. The bare rock surfaces were quickly recolonized by minute mussels, and more than a year was required for mussels to grow to the size that scoters consume. At this rate, most mussel beds would be visited by surf scoter flocks in alternate years. If a bed escaped predation for a few years, mussels could grow to a size too large for surf scoters to handle.    Bay mussels are tightly bound into a matrix by byssal threads making their extraction from the bed difficult. I hypothesized that foraging surf scoters create openings in a mussel bed exposing mussels on the perimeter of the opening which are easier to remove. As more openings are created, the easier access to more mussels makes the bed a more profitable foraging site, which attracts more scoters. A model incorporating this positive-feedback process described my observations whereby a flock of scoters increased over a few days at a site and then abandoned it, leaving an empty bed behind. Flock foraging can be seen as corporate cracking of a mussel bed's defenses, rendering it vulnerable to complete removal.    Surf scoters have generally not been considered in classical accounts of intertidal ecology and community structure. The massive impact on mussel beds documented here suggests that they should be viewed as integral members of the rocky intertidal community. Further study is required to better understand the temporal and spatial scale of the interaction.},

	abstract = {Understanding the factors that determine the spatial distribution of animals is critical to making predictions about how animals will respond to environmental change. Despite this, few studies have attempted to identify factors influencing habitat use decisions of animals in complex natural communities. In this thesis, I use behavioral ecological theory to make specific predictions about how bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) should respond to natural variation in food availability and the risk of predation from tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier). I begin by reviewing shark-dolphin interactions worldwide and show that in some regions sharks and dolphins are intraguild predators. Because there is no theoretical basis for making predictions about the spatial distribution of intraguild predators, I created a game theoretical model of intraguild predation. This model shows that the community context of interactions can influence the predicted distributions of predators and their prey. During field studies in Shark Bay, Western Australia, I found that tiger sharks are the greatest threat to dolphins, and over 74\% of dolphins bear scars from unsuccessful attacks. However, dolphins are a minor component of tiger shark diets, which are composed mainly of dugongs (Dugong dugon), sea snakes, and sea turtles. Tiger shark catch rates were high in warm months and low in cold months and appear to be influenced by both water temperature and seasonal changes in primary prey density. When present, tiger sharks are found most often in shallow habitats where prey density is highest. Dolphins were found to trade-off food and safety. When sharks were absent, dolphins matched the distribution of their food, but when tiger sharks were present, dolphins foraged in productive shallow habitats less than expected by food availability alone. However, juvenile male dolphins foraged in dangerous habitats more often than other age/sex classes. Interestingly, dolphin habitat use may be influenced indirectly by habitat use decisions of other tiger shark prey species because of their influence on sharks. This thesis shows that behavioral ecological theory can be used in natural communities to understand the factors influencing habitat use decisions and that future research will benefit from considering the community context of behavioral decisions.},

	abstract = {C.P.I. is the exclusive distributor of AWWA approved Drisco Prisma HDPE pipe for municipal water lines in B.C. and markets high density polyethylene into the Prairie provinces and overseas. Drisco pipe is manufactured in the U.S. Standard sizes range from two-inch (50-millimetre) through 54-inch (1,350-millimetre). Last fall, C.P.I.'s Parksville branch supplied 16-inch (400-millimetre) and 18-inch (450-millimetre) Dresco-pipe Series 4000 HDPE pipe for a four-mile water transmission line for the village of Ucluelet on Vancouver Island's west coast.              HDPE pipe enables the use of pipe bursting technology. A trenchless method for replacing existing pipes, pipe bursting requires a continuous length of pipe, [David Fuerth] explains. The technique utilizes a bullet-shaped pulling head to break the old pipe, allowing a new, larger pipe to be pulled into place behind it.              Among the other advantages of HDPE pipe is a lower level of head loss. The friction created as fluid flows against the pipe wall causes a reduction in flow pressure which is referred to as 'head loss'. There's less head loss with HDPE because of the smoothness of the material, Fuerth explains, pointing out faster flows mean a smaller pipe can be used. A study of flow rates published in the October 1996 issue of the American Water Works Journal confirmed the faster flows in HDPE pipe, he reports.},

Areas considered were market potential, biology of the animal, environmental impacts, economic feasibility and potential obstacles specific to Nova Scotia including socio/political climate and human health considerations. Most of the factors proved to have negative implications regarding hard clam culture. Much of the suitable area in the Northumberland Strait is closed to shellfish harvest due to contamination, while a large proportion of rural Nova Scotians are strongly opposed to aquaculture development. Slow growth, high mortalities and low landed prices provide inadequate returns. Profitable operations are unlikely unless growth rates increase by 30\% and landed prices are raised to over \$15/kg. As the current price is less than {\textbackslash}\$2.00/kg, such an increase seems highly unlikely. It was therefore concluded that M. mercenaria culture in Nova Scotia is not a viable industry.},

It's because of their renown as food fish that yellow perch are such a sought-after species.              Once the prolific, filter-feeding mussels had established themselves in St. Clair, the lake's normally murky water began to clear dramatically. Improved water clarity allowed a variety of aquatic weeds to flourish. In the end, the aquatic environmental domino effect in St. Clair lead to the flourishing of warm water species of fish like bass, muskies and yellow perch.              After high mercury levels were detected in fish from St. Clair, all angling activity on the lake -- commercial as well as recreational -- ground to a halt. Since the '70s mercury scare, commercial fishing on Lake [Simcoe] St. Clair has ceased completely and perch populations have been subjected to significantly less angling pressure.},

	abstract = {Most articles in the popular press include a statement that zebra mussles have no predators in the Great Lakes. This is not true. Several species of floating hard-shelled organic life and many small fish can eat the larvae of zebra mussels. Adults are eaten by carp and other bottom-feeding fish, crayfish and a wide variety of birds. These major groups of predators are common throughout the world, but predators alone have not been able to control the abundance of zebra mussels in Europe. However, the number of species of potential predators such as crayfish is greater in North America than in Europe, so these may be more effective in the longer term.                 A related fear is that the filtering activities of zebra mussels will put so much organic matter on the bottom that it will cause excessive consumption of oxygen, smothering the eggs of fish such as walleye. At first glance, this seems a reasonable prediction because zebra mussels prefer to attach to solid objects, like the rocks on spawning shoals, where they make their living by filtering organic matter from the water, mixing it with mucus and depositing what they don't digest on the bottom of the lake. Bacterial decomposition of this material would then lead to deprivation of oxygen. However, rocky spawning shoals are rocky because they are in areas exposed to strong currents and wave action, both of which help to maintain the supply of oxygen to the bottom. The latest reports say spawning by walleye last year in Lake Erie was very successful.},

	abstract = {All because of the zebra mussel, an undesirable alien introduced to the Great Lakes in its larval stage when a European freighter pumped its ballast water into Lake St. Clair. Furthermore, it's improbable that the mollusc can be eradicated. It will be with us forever.                 The zebra mussel - so named for its striped shell - measures a little over an inch in length and appears quite innocuous when by itself. But that's a rare sight since the mollusc proliferates at a prodigious pace and spreads like the plague. The mussel lays up to 150,000 eggs over its four to five-year lifespan and has been found in concentrations of hundreds of thousands - per square metre!                 The zebra mussel can load navigation buoys to the point where they'll submerge. Intake pipes at Monroe, Mich. became so clogged they had to be replaced to the tune of \$50 million and Cleveland is expected to be on the hook for about \$100 million.},

Recently, at the urging of the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission, a Canada-U.S. body that reports to the external affairs minister and the U.S. secretary of state, the Canadian coast guard drafted a policy to reduce the likelihood of other organisms or species being introduced into Great Lakes waters.                 Coast guard spokesman Tom Fleck said ships are now being asked to exchange the ballast water they have taken on in coastal waters for deep-sea water before entering the Great Lakes. Mid-ocean salt water species are unlikely to survive in freshwater lakes, he explained.},
