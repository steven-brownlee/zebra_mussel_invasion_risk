T1  - Hemocytes: A Useful Tool for Assessing the Toxicity of Microplastics, Heavy Metals, and Pesticides on Aquatic Invertebrates
AN  - 2756701825
AB  - Invertebrates have long been an important tool for assessing water pollution due to their characteristics as intermediate consumers in aquatic ecosystem food chains. Most of the time, the effects of contaminants are measured by their effect on oxidative status or by mortality, although there already exists an easier tool—hemocytes. Hemocytes are circulating cells with a very important role in the immune system of invertebrates, which can be found within the hemolymph, analogous to the blood in vertebrates. The collection of hemolymph samples is easy, fast, minimally invasive, and poses no danger to the life of invertebrates. The purpose of this review was to highlight the advantages of using hemolymph for toxicity assays of various substances, including heavy metals, micro- and nano-plastics, pesticides, hydrocarbons, and oil spills. A literature search was conducted for this purpose using the most common and most often used databases, with a focus on the most recent and relevant studies. Bivalve mollusks, crustaceans, and gastropods were chosen for this investigation. This review found a growing number of studies choosing to use hemolymph as the standard methodology for toxicology assays, confirming their qualities as reliable tools.

T1  - Influence of Ecological Factors on the Metabolomic Composition of Fish Lenses
AN  - 2756666392
AB  - Simple SummaryBiological responses to rugged ecological factors causes changes in the metabolic pathways in aquatic organisms, which may manifest as changes in the tissue metabolomic composition. Therefore, establishing a correlation between the metabolite concentrations in aquatic animals and ecological factors is important for understanding the molecular mechanisms of biological responses to ecological stresses. In this work, we determined the concentrations of 57 major metabolites in the lenses of fish from three locations in Siberia (Russia) that differed in levels of dissolved oxygen (LDO) and water purity. We found that the increased due to CO2 emissions water acidity and the reduced LDO caused significant changes in the fish lenses’ metabolomic compositions, including amino acids, organic acids, and energy metabolites. The obtained results can be used in monitoring the ecological state of water bodies.AbstractMultiple stressors related to changes in environmental conditions (such as water temperature, salinity, and natural and anthropogenic pollution) may cause biological responses of aquatic organisms that lead to significant variations in the biochemical reactions in their tissues and thereby change the concentrations of metabolites. We used a quantitative NMR-based metabolomic analysis of the fish lens for the evaluation of the influence of environmental factors on metabolic processes in aquatic animals. For this purpose, three species of freshwater fish—Perca fluviatilis, Rutilus rutilus lacustris, and Gymnocephalus cernua—were caught at approximately the same time at three locations in Siberia (Russia) that differed in levels of dissolved oxygen (LDO) and water purity, and the concentrations of 57 major metabolites in the fish lenses were determined. We found that the metabolomic profiles of the fish lenses strongly depended on the location. The obtained data demonstrated that two typical stressors for aquatic animals—a reduced LDO and anthropogenic water pollution—caused a largely similar metabolic response in the fish lenses that led to an increase in the concentrations of several amino acids and a decrease in sarcosine and phosphoethanolamine. At the same time, the composition of the major lens osmolytes depended mostly on the oxygen level, while variations in AMP (decrease) and NAD (increase) corresponded to the water pollution. We suggest that the eye lens is a very convenient tissue for studying the impact of ecological factors on the metabolic state of aquatic animals, fish in particular.

T1  - Impacts of Fortifying Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) Diet with Different Strains of Microalgae on Its Performance, Fillet Quality and Disease Resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila Considering the Interplay between Antioxidant and Inflammatory Response
AN  - 2748252587
AB  - The oxidative stress facing fish during intensive production brings about diseases and mortalities that negatively influence their performance. Along with that, the increased awareness of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3-PUFAs) health benefits has been triggered the introduction of alternative additives in aqua feed that cause not only modulation in fish immune response but also fortification of their fillet. In this context, the role of microalgae mix (NSS) containing Nannochloropsis oculate and Schizochytrium and Spirulina species, which were enriched with bioactive molecules, especially EPA and DHA, was assessed on Nile tilapia’s performance, fillet antioxidant stability, immune response, and disease resistance. Varying levels of NSS (0.75%, 1.5%, and 3%) were added to Nile tilapia’s diet for 12 weeks and then a challenge of fish with virulent Aeromonas hydrophila (A. hydrophila) was carried out. Results showed that groups fed NSS, especially at higher levels, showed an improved WG and FCR, which corresponded with enhanced digestive enzymes’ activities. Higher T-AOC was detected in muscle tissues of NSS3.0% fed fish with remarkable reduction in ROS, H2O2, and MDA contents, which came in parallel with upregulation of GSH-Px, CAT, and SOD genes. Notably, the contents of EPA and DHA in fillet were significantly increased with increasing the NSS levels. The mean log10 counts of pathogenic Vibrio and Staphylococcus species were reduced, and conversely, the populations of beneficial Lactobacillus and Bacillus species were increased more eminent after supplementation of NSS3.0% and NSS1.5%. Moreover, regulation of the immune response (lysozyme, IgM, ACH50, NO, and MPO), upregulation of IL-10, TGF-β, and IgM, and downregulation of IL-1β, TNF-α, HSP70, and COX-2 were observed following dietary higher NSS levels. After challenge, reduction in A. hydrophila counts was more prominent, especially in NSS3.0% supplemented group. Taken together, the current study encourages the incorporation of such microalgae mix in Nile tilapia’s diet for targeting maximum performance, superior fillet quality, and protection against A. hydrophila.

T1  - Self-Healing Hydrogels: Development, Biomedical Applications, and Challenges
AN  - 2734717572
AB  - Polymeric hydrogels have drawn considerable attention as a biomedical material for their unique mechanical and chemical properties, which are very similar to natural tissues. Among the conventional hydrogel materials, self-healing hydrogels (SHH) are showing their promise in biomedical applications in tissue engineering, wound healing, and drug delivery. Additionally, their responses can be controlled via external stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, pressure, or radiation). Identifying a suitable combination of viscous and elastic materials, lipophilicity and biocompatibility are crucial challenges in the development of SHH. Furthermore, the trade-off relation between the healing performance and the mechanical toughness also limits their real-time applications. Additionally, short-term and long-term effects of many SHH in the in vivo model are yet to be reported. This review will discuss the mechanism of various SHH, their recent advancements, and their challenges in tissue engineering, wound healing, and drug delivery.

T1  - Copper Induced DNA Damage in the Gills of the Mussel Mytilus trossulus and Reversibility after Depuration
AN  - 2734632322
AB  - The pollution of coastal water areas by heavy metals is constantly growing; therefore, the study of the mechanisms of impact of these toxicants on the organisms of hydrobionts is a topical direction of toxicology. Particularly pertinent are questions about the state of the reparation system in the aquatic organisms, which make it possible to assess the resistance, survival of hydrobionts, and the probability of remote consequences under the impact of heavy metals. Therefore, in this work, we investigated genome integrity and DNA repair ability in the gill cells of Mytilus trossulus, under conditions of copper (Cu2+) accumulation, and in the process of tissue depuration from this metal. Although the biochemical detoxification system was functioning, it is noted that destructive processes developed, including the accumulation of lipid peroxidation products (MDA) and DNA damage. It was also found that in all of the experimental groups of Mytilus trossulus, in the process of depuration from Cu2+ for 24 h, the levels of DNA damage and MDA content were markedly reduced, and further reduction was less intense.

T1  - Cyanobacterial Bloom Phenology in Green Bay Using MERIS Satellite Data and Comparisons with Western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay
AN  - 2711500840
AB  - Cyanobacteria blooms have been reported to be increasing worldwide. In addition to potentially causing major economic and ecological damage, these blooms can threaten human health. Furthermore, these blooms can be exacerbated by a warming climate. One approach to monitoring and modeling cyanobacterial biomass is to use processed satellite imagery to obtain long-term data sets. In this paper, an existing algorithm for estimating cyanobacterial biomass previously developed for MERIS is validated for Green Bay using cyanobacteria biovolume estimates obtained from field samples. Once the algorithm was validated, the existing MERIS imagery was used to determine the bloom phenology of the cyanobacterial biomass in Green Bay. Modeled datasets of heat flux (as a proxy for stratification), wind speed, water temperature, and gelbstoff absorption along with in situ river discharge data were used to separate bloom seasons in Green Bay from bloom seasons in nearby cyanobacteria bloom hotspots including western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay. Of the ten-year MERIS dataset used here, the highest five years were considered “high bloom” years, and the lowest five years from biomass were considered “low bloom” years and these definitions were used to separate Green Bay. Green Bay had a strong relationship with gelbstoff absorption making it unique among the water bodies, while western Lake Erie responded strongly with river discharge as previously reported. Saginaw Bay, which has low interannual bloom variability, did not exhibit a largely influential single parameter.

T1  - Toxicity Assessment and Treatment Options of Diclofenac and Triclosan Dissolved in Water
AN  - 2706434094
AB  - The presence of pharmaceutical and personal care products in water is increasing tremendously nowadays. Typical representatives are diclofenac (DCF) and triclosan (TCS). Acute toxicity of these substances was experimentally assessed using the freshwater algae Raphidocelis subcapitata (living, immobilized). The IC50 achieved for R. subcapitata was 177.7–189.1 mg·L−1 for DCF and 5.4–17.2 µg·L−1 for TCS, whereas, regarding DCF, the results corresponded to the values observed by other authors. Concerning TCS, the results were lower than predicted and indicated TCSs’ higher toxicity. The immobilized R. subcapitata showed comparable results with its living culture for DCF only. Regarding K2Cr2O7 and TCS, the immobilized alga was more sensitive. The DCF and TCF removal from water was tested by sorption, photocatalytic and photolytic processes. TiO2 was used as a photocatalyst. Norit and SuperSorbon were used as sorbents based on activated charcoal. The DCF decomposition achieved by both photo-processes was very fast. The starting concentration fell below the detection limit in less than one minute, while bioluminescence on Aliivibrio fischeri showed no toxic intermediates formed only in the case of photocatalysis. DCF and TCS removals by sorption were significantly faster on Norit than SuperSorbon, while the bioluminescence inhibition remained insignificant.

T1  - Differential DNA methylation in Pacific oyster reproductive tissue in response to ocean acidification
AN  - 2703960598
AB  - Background 
There is a need to investigate mechanisms of phenotypic plasticity in marine invertebrates as negative effects of climate change, like ocean acidification, are experienced by coastal ecosystems. Environmentally-induced changes to the methylome may regulate gene expression, but methylome responses can be species- and tissue-specific. Tissue-specificity has implications for gonad tissue, as gonad-specific methylation patterns may be inherited by offspring. We used the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) — a model for understanding pH impacts on bivalve molecular physiology due to its genomic resources and importance in global aquaculture— to assess how low pH could impact the gonad methylome. Oysters were exposed to either low pH (7.31 ± 0.02) or ambient pH (7.82 ± 0.02) conditions for 7 weeks. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing was used to identify methylated regions in female oyster gonad samples. C- > T single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified and removed to ensure accurate methylation characterization.
 Results 
Analysis of gonad methylomes revealed a total of 1284 differentially methylated loci (DML) found primarily in genes, with several genes containing multiple DML. Gene ontologies for genes containing DML were involved in development and stress response, suggesting methylation may promote gonad growth homeostasis in low pH conditions. Additionally, several of these genes were associated with cytoskeletal structure regulation, metabolism, and protein ubiquitination — commonly-observed responses to ocean acidification. Comparison of these DML with other Crassostrea spp. exposed to ocean acidification demonstrates that similar pathways, but not identical genes, are impacted by methylation.
 Conclusions 
Our work suggests DNA methylation may have a regulatory role in gonad and larval development, which would shape adult and offspring responses to low pH stress. Combined with existing molluscan methylome research, our work further supports the need for tissue- and species-specific studies to understand the potential regulatory role of DNA methylation.

T1  - Capsaicin-Modified Fluorosilicone Based Acrylate Coating for Marine Anti-Biofouling
AN  - 2693956649
AB  - Capsaicin has been extensively studied for its excellent antifouling activity and very low environmental toxicity. However, mixing natural capsaicin with coatings can cause rapid capsaicin leakage, severely shortening its antifouling cycle. In this study, we describe the preparation and performance of a new capsaicin-modified marine antifouling organofluorosilicone, which is based on silicone and fluorine acrylate monomers covalently bound to an organic antimicrobial monomer, HMBA (N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl)-acrylamide) on a polymer network. The chemical grafting of HMBA into the polymer has improved the problem of short antifouling life of the coating due to antifouling agent leakage and the environmental pollution caused by the leakage. The study focused on the synthesis of pristine acrylate monomers with organic bioactive groups prepared from vanillin amine salts and their co-polymerization in the presence of distal acrylate oligomers. The resulting cross-linked films were characterized using infrared spectroscopy, contact angle, and adhesion analyses. The results indicate that the materials had good adhesion, low surface energy, and were resistant to prolonged immersion in water. The polyacrylate coating synthesized from acrylate exhibited antibacterial and anti-algae activity. Biological tests on the marine microorganisms, Pseudomonas species, Shewanella species, and Navicula incerta, revealed a 97%, 98%, and 99% reduction compared to the blank control group, respectively, indicating that the coating has strong anti-adhesive ability. This work is expected to develop a promising material for marine antifouling.

T1  - DNA Barcoding and Distribution of Gastropods and Malacostracans in the Lower Danube Region
AN  - 2693952818
AB  - This survey reports the spatial distribution of gastropods belonging to Caenogastropoda, Architaenioglossa, Littorinimorpha, Cycloneritida and Hygrophila orders, and malacostracans from Amphipoda and Mysida orders in the lower sector of the Danube River, Romania, using DNA barcoding based on the cytochrome C oxidase I (COI) gene sequence. Sampling was performed for eight locations of Danube Delta branches and Bechet area during three consecutive years (2019–2021). Molecular identification of sixteen gastropods and twelve crustacean individuals was confirmed to the species level, providing the first molecular identification of gastropods from the Lower Danube sector. Phylogenetic analysis showed that species of gastropods and crustaceans clustered in monophyletic groups. Among gastropods, Microcolpia daudebartii acicularis, Viviparus viviparus, Bithynia tentaculata, Physa fontinalis, Ampullaceana lagotis and Planorbarius corneus were identified in Chilia and Sulina branches; and the Bechet area was populated by Holandriana holandrii, Theodoxus transversalis and Gyraulus parvus. The amphipods and mysids were present along the three main Danube branches. The calculated density of these species revealed an abundant community of crustacean Chelicorophium robustum on Sulina branch, and Dikerogammarus haemobaphes and D. villosus in extended areas of the Danube Delta. The presence of these invertebrates along Danube River was reported in relation to the sediment type and water depth.

T1  - Genome-wide signatures of synergistic epistasis during parallel adaptation in a Baltic Sea copepod
AN  - 2688287079
AB  - The role of epistasis in driving adaptation has remained an unresolved problem dating back to the Evolutionary Synthesis. In particular, whether epistatic interactions among genes could promote parallel evolution remains unexplored. To address this problem, we employ an Evolve and Resequence (E&R) experiment, using the copepod Eurytemora affinis, to elucidate the evolutionary genomic response to rapid salinity decline. Rapid declines in coastal salinity at high latitudes are a predicted consequence of global climate change. Based on time-resolved pooled whole-genome sequencing, we uncover a remarkably parallel, polygenic response across ten replicate selection lines, with 79.4% of selected alleles shared between lines by the tenth generation of natural selection. Using extensive computer simulations of our experiment conditions, we find that this polygenic parallelism is consistent with positive synergistic epistasis among alleles, far more so than other mechanisms tested. Our study provides experimental and theoretical support for a novel mechanism promoting repeatable polygenic adaptation, a phenomenon that may be common for selection on complex physiological traits.Using time-series whole-genome sequencing data from a laboratory evolution experiment, along with extensive computer simulations, the authors show that synergistic epistasis could drive rapid parallel freshwater adaptation in a saline copepod.

T1  - A DNA barcode reference library for endemic Ponto-Caspian amphipods
AN  - 2684779901
AB  - The Ponto-Caspian region is an endemicity hotspot that harbours several crustacean radiations, among which amphipods are the most diverse. These poorly known species are severely threatened in their native range, while at the same time they are invading European inland waters with significant ecological consequences. A proper taxonomic knowledge of this fauna is paramount for its conservation within the native region and monitoring outside of it. Here, we assemble a DNA barcode reference library for nearly 60% of all known Ponto-Caspian amphipod species. We use several methods to define molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs), based on two mitochondrial markers (COI and 16S), and assess their congruence with current species-level taxonomy based on morphology. Depending on the method, we find that 54–69% of species had congruent morpho-molecular boundaries. The cases of incongruence resulted from lumping distinct morphospecies into a single MOTU (7–27%), splitting a morphospecies into several MOTUs (4–28%), or both (4–11%). MOTUs defined by distance-based methods without a priori divergence thresholds showed the highest congruence with morphological taxonomy. These results indicate that DNA barcoding is valuable for clarifying the diversity of Ponto-Caspian amphipods, but reveals that extensive work is needed to resolve taxonomic uncertainties. Our study advances the DNA barcode reference library for the European aquatic biota, paving the way towards improved taxonomic knowledge needed to enhance monitoring and conservation efforts.

T1  - Assessment of Paracetamol Toxic Effects under Varying Seawater pH Conditions on the Marine Polychaete Hediste diversicolor Using Biochemical Endpoints
AN  - 2652958715
AB  - Simple SummaryContext of climate change is being widely studied, nevertheless its effects in the toxicity of other contaminants have been poorly study. Particularly, the effects of ocean acidification on the modulation of pharmaceutical absorption and consequent effects, have not been extensively addressed before. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of ocean acidification (specifically pH values of 8.2, 7.9, and 7.6) combined with paracetamol exposure (0, 30, 60, and 120 µg/L) on the polychaeta Hediste diversicolor. To do so, specific biomarkers were measured namely (CAT), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and cyclooxygenase (COX) activities, as well as thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), were quantified to serve as ecotoxicological endpoints. Alterations of CAT, and GSTs activities, and TBARS levels indicate an alteration in redox balances. Differences in exposed pH levels indicate the possible modulation of the absorption of this pharmaceutical in ocean acidifications scenarios. Alterations in AChE were only observed following paracetamol exposure, not being altered by media pH. Hereby obtained results suggest that seawater acidification is detrimental to marine wildlife, since it may enhance toxic effects caused by environmental realistic concentrations of pharmaceuticals. This work is crucial to understand the potential effects of pharmaceuticals in a climate change scenario.AbstractIncreasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are likely to lower ocean pH values, after its dissolution in seawater. Additionally, pharmaceuticals drugs are environmental stressors due to their intrinsic properties and worldwide occurrence. It is thus of the utmost importance to assess the combined effects of pH decreases and pharmaceutical contamination, considering that their absorption (and effects) are likely to be strongly affected by changes in oceanic pH. To attain this goal, individuals of the marine polychaete Hediste diversicolor were exposed to distinct pH levels (8.2, 7.9, and 7.6) and environmentally relevant concentrations of the acidic drug paracetamol (PAR: 0, 30, 60, and 120 µg/L). Biomarkers such as catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and cyclooxygenase (COX) activities, as well as peroxidative damage (through thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) quantification), were quantified to serve as ecotoxicological endpoints. Data showed a general increase in CAT and a decrease in GST activities (with significant fluctuations according to the tested conditions of PAR and pH). These changes are likely to be associated with alterations of the redox cycle driven by PAR exposure. In addition, pH levels seemed to condition the toxicity caused by PAR, suggesting that the toxic effects of this drug were in some cases enhanced by more acidic conditions. An inhibition of AChE was observed in animals exposed to the highest concentration of PAR, regardless of the pH value. Moreover, no lipid peroxidation was observed in most individuals, although a significant increase in TBARS levels was observed for polychaetes exposed to the lowest pH. Finally, no alterations of COX activities were recorded on polychaetes exposed to PAR, regardless of the pH level. The obtained results suggest that seawater acidification is detrimental to marine wildlife, since it may enhance toxic effects caused by environmental realistic concentrations of acidic drugs, such as PAR. This work was crucial to evidence that ocean acidification, in the context of a global change scenario of increased levels of both atmospheric and oceanic CO2, is a key factor in understanding the putative enhanced toxicity of most pharmaceutical drugs that are of an acidic nature.

T1  - Contamination of Soil, Water, Fresh Produce, and Bivalve Mollusks with Toxoplasma gondii Oocysts: A Systematic Review
AN  - 2642438341
AB  - Toxoplasma gondii is a major foodborne pathogen capable of infecting all warm-blooded animals, including humans. Although oocyst-associated toxoplasmosis outbreaks have been documented, the relevance of the environmental transmission route remains poorly investigated. Thus, we carried out an extensive systematic review on T. gondii oocyst contamination of soil, water, fresh produce, and mollusk bivalves, following the PRISMA guidelines. Studies published up to the end of 2020 were searched for in public databases and screened. The reference sections of the selected articles were examined to identify additional studies. A total of 102 out of 3201 articles were selected: 34 articles focused on soil, 40 focused on water, 23 focused on fresh produce (vegetables/fruits), and 21 focused on bivalve mollusks. Toxoplasma gondii oocysts were found in all matrices worldwide, with detection rates ranging from 0.09% (1/1109) to 100% (8/8) using bioassay or PCR-based detection methods. There was a high heterogeneity (I2 = 98.9%), which was influenced by both the sampling strategy (e.g., sampling site and sample type, sample composition, sample origin, season, number of samples, cat presence) and methodology (recovery and detection methods). Harmonized approaches are needed for the detection of T. gondii in different environmental matrices in order to obtain robust and comparable results.

T1  - Zooplankton as Mercury Repository in Lake Maggiore (Northern Italy): Biomass Composition and Stable Isotope Analysis
AN  - 2637789487
AB  - Total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations were analyzed in zooplankton (≥450 and ≥850 µm size fractions) collected seasonally over 6 years in Lake Maggiore (Northern Italy), characterized by a legacy mercury contamination. Analysis of δ 15N and δ13C stable isotopes was carried out to trace how taxa with different trophic levels and carbon sources contributed to mercury concentrations and trends. THg ranged between 44–213 µg kg−1 d.w. and MeHg 15–93 µg kg−1 d.w., representing 24–61% of THg. Values showed strong seasonal variations, with peaks in winter, due to the high biomass of predator taxa (Bythotrephes longimanus, Leptodora kindtii) and of Daphnia longispina-galeata gr. A positive correlation between THg and MeHg and δ15N signature was observed. D. longispina-galeata gr. prevailed in both size fractions, substantially contributing to THg and MeHg concentrations. Δ13C signature was strictly bound to lake thermal circulation dynamics. Mercury stock in the zooplankton compartment ranged between 19–140 ng THg m−2 and 6–44 ng MeHg m−2 for the ≥450 µm size fraction and between 2–66 ng THg m−2 and 1–7 ng MeHg m−2 for the ≥850 µm fraction, with the highest values in spring when zooplanktivorous fish actively prey in the pelagic zone. The results highlighted the crucial role of zooplankton as a repository of mercury, easily available to higher trophic levels.

T1  - Advances in the Fate of Rare Earth Elements, REE, in Transitional Environments: Coasts and Estuaries
AN  - 2627848686
AB  - The production of rare earth elements, REE, has significantly increased over the past years, in parallel with the latest advances in nanotechnologies and representing a new group of emerging contaminants. They find application in construction, transport, agriculture, electronics, catalysis, and biomedicine. Their extraordinary intrinsic characteristics are fundamental for overcoming current technological challenges. The accumulation of REE is consistent in near-shore waters being affected by runoff, wastewater discharge, and proximity to built-up areas. Bioavailability in water, sediments, and accumulation in marine biota as well their endocrine disruptor effect is mostly unknown. There is a significant gap of knowledge on the ecotoxicological behaviour of REE in marine areas. The existing investigations have been performed inside well-mixed estuarine systems, due to complex hydrodynamics and multiple sediment transport situations. This hampers the definition of regulatory thresholds for REE concentrations and emissions. The review summarizes the existing information on REE geochemistry and physicochemical conditions influencing dissolution, surface complexation reactions, and distribution at the continent–ocean interface, as well as their speciation, bioavailability, and detrimental effects on living organisms. Strategies for reducing REE usage and inputs are also discussed.

T1  - Microplastics (Polystyrene) Exposure Induces Metabolic Changes in the Liver of Rare Minnow (Gobiocypris rarus)
AN  - 2627822565
AB  - Microplastics are environmental contaminants and an emergent concern. Microplastics are abundant in freshwater and can cause biochemical stress in freshwater organisms. In the current study, rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) were exposed to 1μm polystyrene microplastics at 200 μg/L concentration. We observed various sublethal effects after four weeks of exposure but no mortality. Numerous cellular and tissue alterations were observed in the liver. Differential metabolites and differentially expressed genes between control and exposure groups were identified and mapped to pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. The combination of transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed significantly varied metabolic pathways between the two groups. These pathways were involved in glucolipid, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism. Results demonstrated that MP exposure induced immune reaction, oxidative stress, and disturbed glycolipid and energy metabolism. The current study provided novel insights into the molecular and metabolic mechanisms of microplastic ecotoxicology in rare minnow.

T1  - Toxicity Study and Quantitative Evaluation of Polyethylene Microplastics in ICR Mice
AN  - 2627811872
AB  - The production, use, and waste of plastics increased worldwide, which resulted in environmental pollution and a growing public health problem. In particular, microplastics have the potential to accumulate in humans and mammals through the food chain. However, the toxicity of microplastics is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the toxicity of 10–50 μm polyethylene microplastics following single- and 28-day repeated oral administration (three different doses of microplastics of 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg/day) in ICR mice. For the investigation, we administered the microplastics orally for single- and 28-day repeated. Then, the histological and clinical pathology evaluations of the rodents were performed to evaluation of the toxicity test, and Raman spectroscopy was used to directly confirm the presence of polyethylene microplastics. In the single oral dose toxicity experiments, there were no changes in body weight and necropsy of the microplastics-treated group compared with that of controls. However, a histopathological evaluation revealed that inflammation from foreign bodies was evident in the lung tissue from the 28-day repeated oral dose toxicity group. Moreover, polyethylene microplastics were detected in the lung, stomach, duodenum, ileum, and serum by Raman spectroscopy. Our results corroborated the findings of lung inflammation after repeated oral administration of polyethylene microplastics. This study provides evidence of microplastic-induced toxicity following repeated exposure to mice.

T1  - Cellulose for the Production of Air-Filtering Systems: A Critical Review
AN  - 2627758401
AB  - The control of airborne contaminants is of great interest in improving air quality, which has deteriorated more and more in recent years due to strong industrial growth. In the last decades, cellulose has been largely proposed as suitable feedstock to build up eco-friendly materials for a wide range of applications. Herein, the issue regarding the use of cellulose to develop air-filtering systems is addressed. The review covers different cellulose-based solutions, ranging from aerogels and foams to membranes and films, and to composites, considering either particulate filtration (PM10, PM2.5, and PM0.3) or gas and water permeation. The proposed solutions were evaluated on the bases of their quality factor (QF), whose high value (at least of 0.01 Pa−1 referred to commercial HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters) guarantees the best compromise between high filtration efficiency (>99%) and low pressure drop (<1 kPa/g). To face this aspect, we first analyzed the different morphological aspects which can improve the final filtration performance, outlining the importance on using nanofibers not only to increase surface area and to modulate porosity in final solutions, but also as reinforcement of filters made of different materials. Besides the description of technological approaches to improve the mechanical filtration, selected examples show the importance of the chemical interaction, promoted by the introduction of active functional groups on cellulose (nano)fibers backbone, to improve filtration efficiency without reducing filter porosity.

T1  - Use of Nanotechnology to Mitigate Biofouling in Stainless Steel Devices Used in Food Processing, Healthcare, and Marine Environments
AN  - 2621381043
AB  - In humid environments, the formation of biofilms and microfouling are known to be the detrimental processes that first occur on stainless steel surfaces. This is known as biofouling. Subsequently, the conditions created by metabolites and the activity of organisms trigger corrosion of the metal and accelerate corrosion locally, causing a deterioration in, and alterations to, the performance of devices made of stainless steel. The microorganisms which thus affect stainless steel are mainly algae and bacteria. Within the macroorganisms that then damage the steel, mollusks and crustaceans are the most commonly observed. The aim of this review was to identify the mechanisms involved in biofouling on stainless steel and to evaluate the research done on preventing or mitigating this problem using nanotechnology in humid environments in three areas of human activity: food manufacturing, the implantation of medical devices, and infrastructure in marine settings. Of these protective processes that modify the steel surfaces, three approaches were examined: the use of inorganic nanoparticles; the use of polymeric coatings; and, finally, the generation of nanotextures.

T1  - Emerging environmental stressors and oxidative pathways in marine organisms: Current knowledge on regulation mechanisms and functional effects
AN  - 2578265668
AB  - Oxidative stress is a critical condition derived from the imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species and the sophisticated network of antioxidant mechanisms. Several pollutants and environmental factors can affect this system through connected mechanisms, indirect relationships, and cascade effects from pre-transcriptional to catalytic level, by either enhancing intracellular ROS formation or impairing antioxidant defenses. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the pro-oxidant challenges from emerging environmental stressors threatening marine organisms, such as pharmaceuticals, microplastics and climate-related ocean changes. Emphasis will be placed on oxidative pathways, including signaling proteins and transcription factors involved in regulation of antioxidant responsiveness. Mechanistic insights and lack of knowledge will be pointed out by presenting single and combined effects of multiple stressors, unravelling questions to be addressed by future research in marine ecotoxicology.

T1  - Mythic Infallibility of the Dog's Nose: Unreliable Information in Law Enforcement Search and Seizure
AN  - 2894464033
AB  - Background. The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guides two social goods exhibiting an essential tension: effective law enforcement search and seizure, and protection of privacy. Unreliable information may subvert the U.S. judicial process. In Fourth Amendment cases involving the use of dogs to sniff out drugs, the validity of this Constitutional guidance is called into question by: the capabilities of the dog, the dog's training, the nature of human-canine interaction, the questionable objectivity of law enforcement officials who base the legitimacy of their searches upon dogs' alerts, and the knowledge of judges and lawyers of the capabilities of human-canine search teams. Each of these elements is characterized by and generates many kinds of information. Concerns about such information, however, are major. Objectives. We explore these concerns through a detailed examination of the 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision Florida v. Harris, draw some policy conclusions about the implications of this use of unreliable information in the judicial system, and provide a brief summary of the information-centric questions the paper considers.

T1  - Paradigms to assess the human health risks of nano- and microplastics
AN  - 2730350414
AB  - Human exposure to nano- and microplastics (NMPs) has raised major societal concerns, yet no framework to assess the risks of NMPs for human health exists. A substantial proportion of plastic produced worldwide is not properly disposed and persists in the environment for decades while degrading. Plastic degradation generates a size continuum of fragments, including nano- and microplastic particles, with numerous associated environmental pollutants and plastic additives, and microbial communities colonising their surfaces. The ubiquitous presence of NMPs, their availability for uptake by organisms and their potential to act as vectors for toxicants and pathogens render risk assessment a priority on the political agenda at the global level. We provide a new, fully integrated risk assessment framework tailored to the specificities of NMPs, enabling an assessment of current and future human health risks from NMPs. The framework consists of four novel paradigms to the traditional risk assessment methodology. These paradigms deal with techniques in NMP analysis, gaps in empirical data, theoretical and modelling approaches and stakeholder engagement. Within the proposed framework, we propose how we can use research experiences gained so far to carry out the different steps of the assessment process, and we define priorities for further research.

T1  - Phytochemistry of Australia's Tropical Rainforest:&nbsp;Medicinal Potential of Ancient Plants
AN  - 2604853437
AB  - Rare, unique and irreplaceable - precious native rainforests occupy a precariously small part of Australia while retaining a remarkable level of both biological and chemical diversity unrivalled by any other ecosystem. Australia's ancient history and traditions are intimately intertwined with the rainforest plants that humans have utilised as both food and medicine. 

Phytochemistry of Australia's Tropical Rainforest is a record of this history and details how our understanding of these plants has led to the discovery of anaesthetics, analgesics, steroids, antimalarials and more. It provides an insight into the habitat, ecology and family associations of hundreds of species and explores their future therapeutic potential, alongside phytochemical studies of the ancient plant lineages. Toxicological evaluations of important poisonous plants are also included. 
Rainforests provide shelter for unique flora and fauna that are counted among the rarest species on Earth, many of which are illustrated in this book. This comprehensive work is an essential reference for phytochemists, ethnobotanists and those with an interest in rainforests and their medicinal and botanical potential.

T1  - An optimized LC-HRMS untargeted metabolomics workflow for multi-matrices investigations in the three-spined stickleback
AN  - 2604483374
AB  - Environmental metabolomics has become a growing research field to understand biological and biochemical perturbations of organisms in response to various abiotic or biotic stresses. It focuses on the comprehensive and systematic analysis of a biologic system’s metabolome. This allows the recognition of biochemical pathways impacted by a stressor, and the identification of some metabolites as biomarkers of potential perturbations occurring in a body. In this work, we describe the development and optimization of a complete reliable methodology based on liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) for untargeted metabolomics studies within a fish model species, the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). We evaluated the differences and also the complementarities between four different matrices (brain, gills, liver and whole fish) to obtain metabolome information. To this end, we optimized and compared sample preparation and the analytical method, since the type and number of metabolites detected in any matrix are closely related to these latter. For the sample preparation, a solid-liquid extraction was performed on a low quantity of whole fish, liver, brain, or gills tissues using combinations of methanol/water/heptane. Based on the numbers of features observed in LC-HRMS and on the responses of analytical standards representative of different metabolites groups (amino acids, sugars…), we discuss the influence of the nature, volume, and ratio of extraction solvents, the sample weight, and the reconstitution solvent. Moreover, the analytical conditions (LC columns, pH and additive of mobile phases and ionization modes) were also optimized so as to ensure the maximum metabolome coverages. Thus, two complementary chromatographic procedures were combined in order to cover a broader range of metabolites: a reversed phase separation (RPLC) on a C18 column followed by detection with positive ionization mode (ESI+) and a hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) on a zwitterionic column followed by detection with negative ionization mode (ESI-). This work provides information on brain, gills, liver, vs the whole body contribution to the stickleback metabolome. These information would help to guide ecotoxicological and biomonitoring studies.

T1  - Response of Rhodococcus cerastii IEGM 1278 to toxic effects of ibuprofen
AN  - 2599054587
AB  - The article expands our knowledge on the variety of biodegraders of ibuprofen, one of the most frequently detected non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the environment. We studied the dynamics of ibuprofen decomposition and its relationship with the physiological status of bacteria and with additional carbon and energy sources. The involvement of cytoplasmic enzymes in ibuprofen biodegradation was confirmed. Within the tested actinobacteria, Rhodococcus cerastii IEGM 1278 was capable of complete oxidation of 100 μg/L and 100 mg/L of ibuprofen in 30 h and 144 h, respectively, in the presence of an alternative carbon source (n-hexadecane). Besides, the presence of ibuprofen induced a transition of rhodococci from single- to multicellular lifeforms, a shift to more negative zeta potential values, and a decrease in the membrane permeability. The initial steps of ibuprofen biotransformation by R. cerastii IEGM 1278 involved the formation of hydroxylated and decarboxylated derivatives with higher phytotoxicity than the parent compound (ibuprofen). The data obtained indicate potential threats of this pharmaceutical pollutant and its metabolites to biota and natural ecosystems.

T1  - RUSBoost: A suitable species distribution method for imbalanced records of presence and absence. A case study of twenty-five species of Iberian bats
AN  - 2580379190
AB  - Traditional Species Distribution Models (SDMs) may not be appropriate when examples of one class (e.g. absence or pseudo-absences) greatly outnumber examples of the other class (e.g. presences or observations), because they tend to favor the learning of observations more frequently. We present an ensemble method called Random UnderSampling and Boosting (RUSBoost), which was designed to address the case where the number of presence and absence records are imbalanced, and we opened the "black-box" of the algorithm to interpret its results and applicability in ecology. We applied our methodology to a case study of twenty-five species of bats from theIberian Peninsula and we build a RUSBoost model for each species. Furthermore,in order to improve to build tighter models, we optimized their hyperparametersusing Bayesian Optimization. In particular, we implemented a objective function that represents the cross-validation loss: kFoldLoss(z), with z representing the hyper-parameters Maximum Number of Splits, Number of Learners and Learning Rate. The models reached average values for Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), specificity, sensitivity, and overall accuracy of 0.84±0.05%, 79.5±4.87%, 74.9±6.05%,and 78.8±5.0%, respectively. We also obtained values of variable importance and we analyzed the relationships between explanatory variables and bat presence probability. The results of our study showed that RUSBoost could be a useful tool to develop SDMs with good performance when the presence/absence databases are imbalanced. The application of this algorithm could improve the prediction of SDMs and help in conservation biology and management.

T1  - Loon Lessons:&nbsp;Uncommon Encounters with the Great Northern Diver
AN  - 2545365546
AB  - The nature of the common loon, from biology to behavior, from one of the world's foremost observers of the revered waterbird Even those who know the loon's call might not recognize it as a tremolo, yodel, or wail, and may not understand what each call means, how it's made, and why. And those who marvel at the loon's diving prowess might wonder why this bird has such skill, or where loons go when they must leave northern lakes in winter. For these and so many other mysteries, Loon Lessons provides evolutionary and ecological explanations that are curious and compelling. Written by one of the world's foremost experts on the subject, the book is a compendium of knowledge about the common loon and an engaging record of scientific sleuthing, documenting more than twenty-five years of research into the great northern diver. James D. Paruk has observed and compared loons from Washington and Saskatchewan to the coasts of California and Louisiana, from high elevation deserts in Nevada to mountain lakes in Maine. Drawing on his extensive experience, a wealth of data, and well-established scientific principles, he considers every aspect of the loon, from its plumage and anatomy to its breeding, migration, and wintering strategies. Here, in the first detailed scientific account of the common loon in more than thirty years, Paruk describes its biology in an accessible and entertaining style that affords a deeper understanding of this beautiful and mysterious bird's natural history and annual life cycle.

T1  - Effects of fragrance compounds on growth of the silkworm Bombyx mori
AN  - 2541553501
AB  - Due to the contamination and biological toxicity of some fragrance compounds, the environmental and ecological problems of such compounds have attracted more and more attention. However, studies of the toxicity of fragrance compounds for insects have been limited. The toxicity of 48 fragrance compounds for the silkworm Bombyx mori were investigated in this study. All of the fragrance compounds examined had no acute toxicity for B. mori larvae, but eight of them (menthol, maltol, musk xylene, musk tibeten, dibutyl sulfide, nerolidol, ethyl vanillin, and α-amylcinnamaldehyde) exhibited chronic and lethal toxicity with LC50 values from 20 to 120 µM. In a long-term feeding study, musk tibeten, nerolidol, and musk xylene showed significant growth regulatory activity. They were also extremely harmful to the cocooning of B. mori, resulting in small, thin, and loose cocoons. Two important insect hormones, namely, juvenile hormone (JH) and 20-hydroxyecdysone (20-E), were quantified in hemolymph following chronic exposure to musk tibeten, nerolidol, and musk xylene, respectively. Musk tibeten significantly increased JH titer and decreased the 20-E titer in hemolymph, and musk xylene had a significant inhibitory effect on JH titer and increased 20-E titer. Although nerolidol had no effect on hormone levels, exogenous JH mimic nerolidol increased the physiological effects of JH and significantly slowed the growth rate of B. mori larvae. The results showed that these fragrance compounds could interfere with the insect endocrine system, leading to death and abnormal growth. The risk to insects of residual fragrance compounds in the environment is worthy of attention.

T1  - Energy Metabolism and Aging
AN  - 2818804905
AB  - Aging is strongly related to energy metabolism, but the underlying processes and mechanisms are complex and incompletely understood. Restricting energy intake and reducing metabolic rate can slow the rate of aging and extend longevity, implying a reciprocal relationship between energy metabolism and life expectancy. However, increased energy expenditure has also been associated with improved health and longer life. In both experimental animals and humans, reduced body temperature has been related to extended longevity. However, recent findings on the function of thermogenic (brown or beige) adipose tissue produced intense interest in increasing the amount of energy expended for thermogenesis to prevent and/or treat obesity, improve metabolic health, and extend life. Evidence available to-date indicates that increasing adipose tissue thermogenesis by pharmacologic, environmental, or genetic interventions can indeed produce significant metabolic benefits, which are associated with improved chances for healthy aging and long life.

T1  - Microbial characterization of a natural biofilm associated with Peruvian scallop (Argopecten purpuratus) larvae settlement on artificial collector by confocal imaging, microbiology, and metagenomic analysis
AN  - 2509034584
AB  - Biofilms strongly influence bivalve settlement patterns on artificial substrates; however, their structure and taxonomic composition remains a black box. We characterized a natural biofilm composition that exhibits a large settlement of larvae of the Peruvian scallop Argopecten purpuratus by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Thirty-two different strains, representing six genera (10 strains of Bacillus, 9 of Vibrio, 6 Acinetobacter, 4 Staphylococcus, 2 Photobacterium, and 1 Exiguobacterium) were isolated. Those strains represented only 1.09% of the relative abundance compared with the total microbiota obtained by 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing. The metagenomic analysis identified 441 species. Prokaryotes were predominant (93.4%) over eukaryotes (6.6%), with Pelobacter (13.4%), Lewinella (5.6%), Marinobacter (5.4%), Hoeflea (4.2%), and Microcystis (3.1%) being the most representative genera. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) imaging evidenced an irregular and heterogeneous biofilm with an average thickness of 35 pm, where the heterotrophic prokaryotic community (3.4×106 cell cm-2) dominate the photoautotrophic communities (2.3×105 cell cm-2). For the first time, an A. purpuratus settlement-related biofilm was described by the next generation sequencing tool (NGS) and compared with traditional methodologies.

T1  - Scenario-based cost-effectiveness analysis of ballast water treatment strategies
AN  - 2508040009
AB  - This work evaluates technological strategies that include conventional vessel-based and alternative barge-based technologies to meet various treatment standards and combinations. We construct a vessel-versus-barge compliance cost framework informed by California efforts to provide additional protection from ballast discharge invasive risk. The technology-policy goal is to achieve the regulatory standards with appropriate technology, and meanwhile, minimize the compliance cost to reduce the burden on the shipping industry. The results show that the required numeric standards matter a lot. If a single global standard is a weak standard, then adopting vessel-based compliant technology is less costly than centralized barge-based compliance. We consider these findings to apply generally beyond the California context. Specifically, if some region or all regions adopt standards different from current global standards (i.e., stricter), barge-based systems can be less costly than retrofitting world fleets. The findings reveal the potential role of barge-based treatment measure. The increased $0.7 billion compliance cost for the U.S. to achieve stricter ballast water regulation per year may inform the relevant policymakers.

T1  - First report of detection of microcystins in farmed Mediterranean mussels Mytilus galloprovincialisin Thermaikos gulf-Greece, using ELISA and liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry
AN  - 2531555830
AB  - Background

Microcystins are emerging marine biotoxins, produced by potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Their presence has been reported in aquatic animals in Greek internal waters, while data are few in marine environments. Since the climate change induce eutrophication and harmful algal blooms in coastal marine ecosystems affecting the public health, further research on microcystins’ presence in marine waters is required. The aim of this study was to detect the potential presence of microcystins in mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis in the largest farming areas in Thermaikos gulf, in Northern Greece, and to investigate their temporal and spatial distribution, adding to the knowledge of microcystins presence in Greek Mediterranean mussels.

Results

A three years microcystins’ assessment was conducted from 2013 to 2016, in farmed Mediterranean mussels Mytilus galloprovincialis, in five sampling areas in Thermaikos gulf, in northern Greece, where the 90% of mussels’ farming activities is located. The isolation of potentially toxic cyanobacteria was confirmed by molecular methods. An initial screening was performed with a qualitative and quantitative direct monoclonal (DM) ELISA and results above 1ng/g were confirmed for the occurrence of the most common microcystins -RR, -LR and -YR, by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) coupled with a high- resolution mass spectrometer (HRMS) (Orbitrap analyzer). Microcystin -RR and microcystin -LR were detected, while the intensity of microcystin-YR was below the method detection limit. Most samples that exhibited concentrations above 1ng/g were detected during the warm seasons of the year and especially in Spring. Results indicated an overestimation of the ELISA method, since concentrations ranged between 0.70 ± 0.15 ng/g and 53.90 ± 3.18 ng/g, while the confirmation declared that the levels of microcystins were 6 to 22 times lower.

Conclusions

Microcystin RR and microcystin LR were detected for the first time in mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis, harvested from farms in Thermaikos gulf, in Central Macedonia, in Greece. Their presence was linked to potentially toxic cyanobacteria. Bioaccumulation in digestive gland was observed, while the concentrations in muscles were found extremely low. Samples with levels above 1ng/g were observed mostly during spring, confirming the seasonal distribution of microcystins. The comparison of the results by the ELISA and the LC-Orbitrap MS method indicated an overestimation of concentration by the ELISA method.

T1  - Application of an ice thermodynamic model to a shallow freshwater lagoon
AN  - 2676153666
AB  - In this study, we apply an ice thermodynamic model to a shallow freshwater lagoon in the south-eastern part of the Baltic Sea — the Curonian Lagoon. The model results were compared with the measurement data from three near‑shore stations during the period of 2004–2017. The simulation data showed the model to be capable of replicating ice thickness dynamics rather well (mean R = 0.92, RMSE = 6 cm). Although the model overestimated the number of ice days (NID) on average by one month (ranging from 3 to 40 days), the overall pattern was very similar to observations (R = 0.95). We further assessed the ice thickness and NID projections in the near (2021–2040) and far (2081–2100) future under two climate change scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The results showed that the mean (max) ice thickness could decrease by 10–49% (6–34%) in the near and 41–75% (22–55%) in the far future under RCP4.5, and by 2–52% (2–30%) in the near and 75–88% (50–71%) in the far future under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline period of 1986–2005. The NID will shorten by 9–19% (9–22%) in the near and 15–36% (46–57%) in the far future under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5) scenarios, compared with the baseline period.

T1  - Quantification of Platinum in Edible Mushrooms Using Voltammetric Techniques
AN  - 2656394005
AB  - Edible mushrooms are a food source with interesting nutritional values. The chief objective of this research was to develop a consistent method for the quantitative ultra-trace analysis of Pt in mushrooms, which is complex because it cannot be readily quantified by common analytical procedures. This research is one of the first analytical methods to establish Pt amount in these vegetables. In this research, 28 different edible mushroom samples from Italy were investigated. Determination of Pt in mushrooms was completed using Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV). In this study, we applied the standard addition method because there are no certified reference mushrooms containing platinum group elements on the market. The platinum quantification limit was 0.03 µg kg−1 d.w. In the analyzed samples, platinum amount was in the range of 0.03–73 µg kg−1. Our mushroom samples had a Pt content lower than the concentrations recommended by international establishments for other foodstuffs. In the future, the optimized method could be used for the analysis of plant and animal matrices intended for food supply.

T1  - Considerations of Use-Use Interactions between Macroalgae Cultivation and Other Maritime Sectors: An Eastern Baltic MSP Case Study
AN  - 2612851241
AB  - With the blue economic sectors growing, marine macroalgae cultivation plays an important role in securing food and energy supplies, as well as better water quality in sustainable ways, whether alone or as part of a cluster solution to mitigate the effects of fish farming. While macroalgae cultivation exists in Europe, it is not that widely distributed yet; with increasing marine activities at sea, Maritime Spatial Planning (MSP) needs to ensure social recognition as well as social and spatial representation for such a new marine activity. This comparative case study analysis of MSPs of three eastern Baltic Sea countries explores the levels of support for the development of macroalgae cultivation in MSP and the degree of co-location options for this new and increasingly important sector. It presents new analytical ways of incorporating co-location considerations into the concept of social sustainability. The results of this study support the harmonisation of views on co-location, propose ways of using space to benefit multiple users as well as marine ecosystems, and highlight some of the key social challenges and enablers for this sector.

T1  - Metal Pollution and Bioaccumulation in the Nhue-Day River Basin, Vietnam: Potential Ecological and Human Health Risks
AN  - 2612776802
AB  - (1) Background: Metal pollution in the Nhue-Day River basin has impacted approximately 12 million people. However, none of the previous studies considered the entire basin’s environmental and health risks. Thus, this research aims to fill knowledge gaps and reduce risks. (2) Methods: Sediment and fish samples from the basin were analyzed to determine the levels of Zn, Cu, Pb, and Cd pollution and their potential ecological (EF, modified Pollution Index—mPI, and expanded, modified potential ecological risk index—emRI) and human health risks (THQ, HI, and TR indices). (3) Results: Metal levels in sediment exceeded Canadian aquatic life protection guidelines, indicating moderate to severe contamination (EFs: 1.3–58.5 and mPIs: 4–39). Compared to the new proposed ecological risk threshold, all river sites and Site 1 for ponds had elevated metal levels; and these posed a very high ecological risk in spring (emRI > 4.5), with Cd being the most hazardous. Lead levels in all fish tissues surpassed Vietnamese and EU food regulations. In agreement with THQ, EWI (Zn, Cu) and EMI (Cd) were both less than 2.5% of the PTWI and PTMI, respectively. However, HI values of 0.67–1.26 suggested a moderate health risk. Carcinogenic risk (TR > 10−6; estimated for Pb) was detected in several localities for Common carp and Tilapia during the warm season. (4) Conclusions: Metals had a negative impact on the basin’s ecosystem, with Cd being the most dangerous. Because of lead, consumption of Common carp and Tilapia from the basin may pose both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health concerns.

T1  - Freshwater crabs could act as vehicles of spreading avian influenza virus
AN  - 2611348276
AB  - Avian influenza virus (AIV) possessed significant risk to various animals and human health. Wild birds, especially waterfowls are considered to be the natural reservoir of AIVs. The ecology of AIV is still far from being fully understood. Freshwater crabs are nonnegligible biotic factor in AIV ecosystem. We analyzed the ability of freshwater crabs accumulate and spread AIV. We found that AIV remain infectious in water only for 36 h but persist in crabs for 48 h. Crabs could accumulate AIV in their gills and gastrointestinal tracts. The AIV titers in crabs were higher than the surrounding contaminated water. Crabs could accumulate AIV from contaminated water, carry the virus and spread to naïve crabs via surrounding water. Our study identified freshwater crab as a novel transmission vehicle in AIV ecosystem.

T1  - What Animal Cancers teach us about Human Biology
AN  - 2598229618
AB  - Cancers in animals present a large, underutilized reservoir of biomedical information with critical implication for human oncology and medicine in general. Discussing two distinct areas of tumour biology in non-human hosts, we highlight the importance of these findings for our current understanding of cancer, before proposing a coordinated strategy to harvest biomedical information from non-human resources and translate it into a clinical setting.
First, infectious cancers that can be transmitted as allografts between individual hosts, have been identified in four distinct, unrelated groups, dogs, Tasmanian devils, Syrian hamsters and, surprisingly, marine bivalves. These malignancies might hold the key to improving our understanding of the interaction between tumour cell and immune system and, thus, allow us to devise novel treatment strategies that enhance anti-cancer immunosurveillance, as well as suggesting more effective organ and stem cell transplantation strategies. The existence of these malignancies also highlights the need for increased scrutiny when considering the existence of infectious cancers in humans.
Second, it has long been understood that no linear relationship exists between the number of cells within an organism and the cancer incidence rate. To resolve what is known as Peto's Paradox, additional anticancer strategies within different species have to be postulated. These naturally occurring idiosyncrasies to avoid carcinogenesis represent novel potential therapeutic strategies.

T1  - The Role of Micronutrients and Toxic Metals in the Management of Epidemics in Cambodia
AN  - 2596023873
AB  - The illegal trade of wildlife in SE Asia has been identified as the likely cause of the COVID-19 pandemic. We reviewed 198 papers on the current COVID pandemic in Cambodia, diseases such as avian influenza and Nipah virus, most likely to develop into a new pandemic in Cambodia, and common features of disease that require mitigation. Artisanal goldmining uses pure mercury in the areas where wildlife is smuggled to China. Moreover, 30–40% of Cambodians are zinc deficient. High levels of arsenic in irrigation water (>1000 µg/L) are associated with very low levels of zinc in rice (5 µg/g) and rice is the primary staple food for the region. Brown rice from nine of 15 paddy fields in the arsenic zone of Cambodia had double the new guidelines of 100 µg/kg inorganic arsenic for children’s food in the EU and USA. The combination of deficiencies of essential micronutrients like zinc and pervasive presence of arsenic and mercury has the potential to compromise the immunity of many Cambodians. Innovative solutions are suggested to improve micronutrient nutrition. Toxins that suppress the immune system must be better managed to reduce the virulence of pathogens. Cambodia was not likely the source of the COVID-19 but does have problems that could result in a new pandemic.

T1  - Growth Mechanism of Micro/Nano Metal Dendrites and Cumulative Strategies for Countering Its Impacts in Metal Ion Batteries: A Review
AN  - 2584479639
AB  - Metal-ion batteries are capable of delivering high energy density with a longer lifespan. However, they are subject to several issues limiting their utilization. One critical impediment is the budding and extension of solid protuberances on the anodic surface, which hinders the cell functionalities. These protuberances expand continuously during the cyclic processes, extending through the separator sheath and leading to electrical shorting. The progression of a protrusion relies on a number of in situ and ex situ factors that can be evaluated theoretically through modeling or via laboratory experimentation. However, it is essential to identify the dynamics and mechanism of protrusion outgrowth. This review article explores recent advances in alleviating metal dendrites in battery systems, specifically alkali metals. In detail, we address the challenges associated with battery breakdown, including the underlying mechanism of dendrite generation and swelling. We discuss the feasible solutions to mitigate the dendrites, as well as their pros and cons, highlighting future research directions. It is of great importance to analyze dendrite suppression within a pragmatic framework with synergy in order to discover a unique solution to ensure the viability of present (Li) and future-generation batteries (Na and K) for commercial use.

T1  - Genotoxicity of Polystyrene (PS) Microspheres in Short-Term Exposure to Gametes of the Sand Dollar Scaphechinus mirabilis (Agassiz, 1864) (Echinodermata, Echinoidea)
AN  - 2584404727
AB  - Microplastic pollution appears to be one of the major environmental problems in the world today, and researchers have been paying special attention to the study of the impact of microplastics on biota. In this article, we studied the short-term effects of polystyrene micro-spheres on genome integrity using the gametes of the Scaphechinus mirabilis sand dollar with the comet assay method. This highly sensitive method allowed us to identify the level of genome damage in both gametes before and after short-term exposure to PS microparticles. It was shown that primary polystyrene microspheres at concentrations of 104, 105, and 106 particles/L had a genotoxic effect during short-term exposure to the sperm of the sand dollar S. mirabilis, which was expressed as a significant increase in sperm DNA damage. The highest percentage of DNA damage (more than 20%) was detected in spermatozoa exposed for 1 h in water containing 105 microspheres of plastic per 1 L. Additionally, at all concentrations of microplastic studied in the experiment, the genetic damage index (GDI) values in spermatozoa exceeded the control level. However, regardless of the level of DNA damage, spermatozoa retained the ability to fertilise eggs with up to 97% efficiency. We must acknowledge that the genotoxic property of microplastic against sperm to some extent predicts the development of long-term adverse effects of environmental significance.

T1  - Pharmaceutical Products and Pesticides Toxicity Associated with Microplastics (Polyvinyl Chloride) in Artemia salina
AN  - 2584384783
AB  - Pharmaceutical products, as well as insecticides and antimicrobials, have been extensively studied, but knowledge of their effects—especially those caused by their mixtures with microplastics—on aquatic organisms remains limited. However, it should be borne in mind that the state of knowledge on acute and chronic effects in aquatic organisms for pharmaceuticals and pesticides is not similar. In response, this investigation analyzed the presence of microplastics (polyvinyl chloride) and their impacts on the toxicity of chlorpyrifos (an insecticide) and triclosan (an antibacterial) when they coincide in the environment, alongside the two most consumed drugs of their type (hypolipemic and anticonvulsant, respectively), namely simvastatin and carbamazepine, in Artemia salina. LC50 and cholinesterase enzyme activity were calculated to determine the possible neurotoxicity associated with emergent contaminants in the treatments. The LC50 values obtained were 0.006 mg/dm3 for chlorpyrifos, 0.012 mg/dm3 for chlorpyrifos associated with microplastics, 4.979 mg/dm3 for triclosan, 4.957 mg/dm3 for triclosan associated with microplastics, 9.35 mg/dm3 for simvastatin, 10.29 mg/dm3 for simvastatin associated with microplastics, 43.25 mg/dm3 for carbamazepine and 46.50 mg/dm3 for carbamazepine associated with microplastics in acute exposure. These results indicate that the presence of microplastics in the medium reduces toxicity, considering the LC50 values. However, exposure to chlorpyrifos and carbamazepine, both alone and associated with microplastics, showed a decline in cholinesterase activity, confirming their neurotoxic effect. Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed with the biomarker cholinesterase between the toxicant and the toxicant with microplastics.

T1  - Human Drug Pollution in the Aquatic System: The Biochemical Responses of Danio rerio Adults
AN  - 2584338190
AB  - Simple SummaryThe release of medicinal products for human use in the aquatic environment is now a serious problem, and can be fatal for the organisms that live there. Danio rerio is a freshwater fish that provides the possibility to study the effects of these pollutants on the health of aquatic organisms. The results of the various existing scientific studies are scarce and conflicting. Here, we review the scientific studies that have analyzed these effects, highlighting that the impacts of drugs are evident in the biochemical responses of these animals.AbstractTo date, drug pollution in aquatic systems is an urgent issue, and Danio rerio is a model organism to study the toxicological effects of environmental pollutants. The scientific literature has analyzed the effect of human drug pollution on the biochemical responses in the tissues of D. rerio adults. However, the information is still scarce and conflicting, making it difficult to understand its real impact. The scientific studies are not consistent with each other and, until now, no one has grouped their results to create a baseline of knowledge of the possible impacts. In this review, the analysis of literature data highlights that the effects of drugs on adult zebrafishes depend on various factors, such as the tissue analyzed, the drug concentration and the sex of the individuals. Furthermore, the most influenced biochemical responses concern enzymes (e.g., antioxidants and hydrolase enzymes) and total protein and hormonal levels. Pinpointing the situation to date would improve the understanding of the chronic effects of human drug pollution, helping both to reduce it in the aquatic systems and then to draw up regulations to control this type of pollution.

T1  - First Experimental Evidence for the Presence of Potentially Virulent Klebsiella oxytoca in 14 Species of Commonly Consumed Aquatic Animals, and Phenotyping and Genotyping of K. oxytoca Isolates
AN  - 2584305525
AB  - Klebsiella oxytoca is a recently emerging pathogen that can cause necrotizing enterocolitis, hemorrhagic colitis, sepsis-associated purpura fulminans, and infective endocarditis in humans. The bacterium is ubiquitous in water and soil environments. Nevertheless, current literature on K. oxytoca in aquatic products is rare. In this study, we surveyed K. oxytoca contamination in 41 species of consumable aquatic animals sold in July, August, and September of 2018 and 2019 in Shanghai, China, 40 of which had no history of carrying this bacterium. K. oxytoca was for the first time isolated from 14 species with high abundance in benthic animals. None of the K. oxytoca isolates (n = 125) harbored toxin genes mviM, tisB, and yqgB. However, a high occurrence of virulence-associated genes was observed, including brkB (73.6%), cdcB (66.4%), pduV (64.8%), and virk (63.2%). Resistance to sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim (56.0%) was the most predominant among the isolates, followed by chloramphenicol (6.4%), tetracycline (5.6%), and kanamycin (3.2%). Approximately 8.0% of the isolates displayed multidrug resistant phenotypes. Meanwhile, high percentages of the isolates tolerated the heavy metals Cu2+ (84.8%), Pb2+ (80.8%), Cr3+ (66.4%), Zn2+ (66.4%), and Hg2+ (49.6%). Different virulence and resistance profiles were observed among K. oxytoca isolates in 3 types and 14 species of aquatic animals. The ERIC-PCR-based genome fingerprinting of the 125 K. oxytoca isolates revealed 108 ERIC genotypes with 79 singletons, which demonstrated the genetic diversity of the isolates. The results of this study fill gaps for policy and research in the risk assessment of K. oxytoca in consumable aquatic animals.

T1  - Influence of body size, temperature, and diet concentration on feeding of Styela clava
AN  - 2536552148
AB  - As solitary filter feeder, Styela clava shows superior water purification capacity in the integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) model consisting of S. clava, microalgae, and sea cucumber, which should be an ideal system to reduce organic and inorganic pollution in the water. It is of great significance to study the physiological energetics of S. clava for the application of this IMTA system. The physiological energetics of S. clava was determined in a simulated natural culture system to provide information for comparing to the energetic data derived from feeding ecological studies. The ascidians were grouped into five cohorts based on body size in terms of their wet weight of 1.5-2.0 g, 2.5-3.5 g, 5.0-6.5 g, 8.0-9.5 g, and 11.0-14.0 g, respectively. Clearance rate (CR), ingestion rate (IR), and assimilation efficiency (AE) of ascidian were estimated using flow-through feeding chambers. The results showed that the CR and IR increased exponentially with the ascidians' body size at different temperatures. Body size showed little effect on AE at the same water temperature. However, significant differences were observed between different temperature regions in the range of 12-28°C regardless of body size. S. clava performed far better in feeding behavior at 20°C than that at higher or lower temperatures. Within the range of diet concentration (as particulate organic matter, POM) from 2.11 to 6.11 mg POM/L, the CR and IR increased exponentially with POM. This study provides basic data for the application of ascidian in the IMTA system.

T1  - Avian Influenza in Wild Birds and Poultry: Dissemination Pathways, Monitoring Methods, and Virus Ecology
AN  - 2532169036
AB  - Avian influenza is one of the largest known threats to domestic poultry. Influenza outbreaks on poultry farms typically lead to the complete slaughter of the entire domestic bird population, causing severe economic losses worldwide. Moreover, there are highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strains that are able to infect the swine or human population in addition to their primary avian host and, as such, have the potential of being a global zoonotic and pandemic threat. Migratory birds, especially waterfowl, are a natural reservoir of the avian influenza virus; they carry and exchange different virus strains along their migration routes, leading to antigenic drift and antigenic shift, which results in the emergence of novel HPAI viruses. This requires monitoring over time and in different locations to allow for the upkeep of relevant knowledge on avian influenza virus evolution and the prevention of novel epizootic and epidemic outbreaks. In this review, we assess the role of migratory birds in the spread and introduction of influenza strains on a global level, based on recent data. Our analysis sheds light on the details of viral dissemination linked to avian migration, the viral exchange between migratory waterfowl and domestic poultry, virus ecology in general, and viral evolution as a process tightly linked to bird migration. We also provide insight into methods used to detect and quantify avian influenza in the wild. This review may be beneficial for the influenza research community and may pave the way to novel strategies of avian influenza and HPAI zoonosis outbreak monitoring and prevention.

T1  - Increases in Great Lake winds and extreme events facilitate interbasin coupling and reduce water quality in Lake Erie
AN  - 2500162123
AB  - Climate change affects physical and biogeochemical processes in lakes. We show significant increases in surface-water temperature (~ 0.5 °C decade−1; > 0.2% year−1) and wave power (> 1% year−1; the transport of energy by waves) associated with atmospheric phenomena (Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and Multivariate El Niño/Southern Oscillation) in the month of August between 1980 and 2018 in the Laurentian Great Lakes. A pattern in wave power, in response to extreme winds, was identified as a proxy to predict interbasin coupling in Lake Erie. This involved the upwelling of cold and hypoxic (dissolved oxygen < 2 mg L−1) hypolimnetic water containing high total phosphorus concentration from the seasonally stratified central basin into the normally well-mixed western basin opposite to the eastward flow. Analysis of historical records indicate that hypoxic events due to interbasin exchange have increased in the western basin over the last four decades (43% in the last 10 years) thus affecting the water quality of the one of the world’s largest freshwater sources and fisheries.

T1  - Determination of Pharmaceuticals, Heavy Metals, and Oxysterols in Fish Muscle
AN  - 2495228979
AB  - The present study aimed to assess the levels of 98 multi-class pharmaceuticals including cardiovascular drugs, antidepressants, hypnotics, antibiotics, and sulfonamides occurring in the muscle tissue of fish caught in the Baltic Sea. The following fish species were collected: perch (Perca fluviatilis); flounder (Platichthys flesus); turbot (Scophthalmus maximus); plaice (Pleuronectes platessa); cod (Gadus morhua callarias); bream (Abramis brama); crucian (Carassius carassius). Additionally, in the examined fish muscle the levels of heavy metals and trace elements were determined (As; Ag; Au; Ba; Cd; Co; Cr; Cu; Hg; Li; Mo; Ni; Pb; Sb; Se; Sn; Tl; V) as well as the levels of cholesterol and its 5 derivatives (7-ketocholesterol; 7α-hydroxycholesterol; 7β-hydroxycholesterol; 5β,6β-epoxy-cholesterol; 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol). In the performed studies 11 out of 98 examined pharmaceuticals were detected in fish muscle. The levels of pharmaceuticals in fish muscle varied depending on the species. In the tissues of bream and crucian, no pharmaceuticals were found. Mercury, lead and arsenic were detected in the muscles of all examined fish. Based on the hazard factor for Hg, Pb, Cd, Ni (target hazard quotient, THQ < 1), it was found that the consumption of the studied fish does not constitute a health risk. However, the THQ for As remained >1 indicated possible risk from those metals. In the examined fish muscle the total cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) level of oxysterols were, respectively: 6.90 (cod) μg/g–4.18 μg/g (perch), which corresponded to 0.7–1.5% of cholesterol. The main COPs evaluated were 7-ketocholesterol (0.78 ± 0.14–1.79 ± 0.06 μg/g), 7β-hydroxycholesterol (0.50 ± 0.04–3.20 ± 2.95 μg/g) and 5β,6β-epoxycholesterol (0.66 ± 0.03–1.53 ± 0.66 μg/g). The assessment of health hazards due to contaminations is necessary, which may help to introduce national legislation and global standards aimed at reducing or even eliminating the exposure to contaminants.

T1  - Catechol-Based Antimicrobial Polymers
AN  - 2480896499
AB  - Catechol is a key constituent in mussel adhesive proteins and is responsible for strong adhesive property and crosslinking formation. Plant-based polyphenols are also capable of chemical interactions similar to those of catechol and are inherently antimicrobial. This review reports a series of catechol-based antimicrobial polymers classified according to their antimicrobial mechanisms. Catechol is utilized as a surface anchoring group for adhering monomers and polymers of known antimicrobial properties onto various types of surfaces. Additionally, catechol’s ability to form strong complexes with metal ions and nanoparticles was utilized to sequester these antimicrobial agents into coatings and polymer matrices. During catechol oxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) is generated as a byproduct, and the use of the generated ROS for antimicrobial applications was also introduced. Finally, polymers that utilized the innate antimicrobial property of halogenated catechols and polyphenols were reviewed.

T1  - Physiological, Developmental, and Biomarker Responses of Zebrafish Embryos to Sub-Lethal Exposure of Bendiocarb
AN  - 2479378267
AB  - Bendiocarb is a broad-spectrum insecticide recommended for malaria control by the World Health Organization (WHO). Still, bendiocarb poses a toxic risk to populations of nontargeted aquatic organisms. Thus, our study was aimed to evaluate the sub-lethal effects of bendiocarb exposure on zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos by assessing of physiological, developmental, and biochemical parameters. Bendiocarb-induced adverse effects on embryonic development, larval growth, heart rate, changes in phase II detoxifying enzyme glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity, oxidative stress-related enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)), and the damage-linked biomarker lipid peroxidation (LPO) in early life stage zebrafish were investigated. Our results highlight that the selected nonlethal concentrations (96 h median lethal concentration in this study was 32.52 mg/L−1) of bendiocarb inflicted adverse effects resulting in embryo deformities (96 h EC50 = 2.30 mg L−1), reduced body- and notochord length (above 0.75 and 0.39 mg L−1 bendiocarb concentrations at 96 hpf, respectively), oxidative stress, and altered heart rate (above 0.4 mg L−1 at 48 hpf) in the studied model system.

T1  - Molecular Methods for the Detection of Toxoplasma gondii Oocysts in Fresh Produce: An Extensive Review
AN  - 2478677164
AB  - Human infection with the important zoonotic foodborne pathogen Toxoplasma gondii has been associated with unwashed raw fresh produce consumption. The lack of a standardised detection method limits the estimation of fresh produce as an infection source. To support method development and standardisation, an extensive literature review and a multi-attribute assessment were performed to analyse the key aspects of published methods for the detection of T. gondii oocyst contamination in fresh produce. Seventy-seven published studies were included, with 14 focusing on fresh produce. Information gathered from expert laboratories via an online questionnaire were also included. Our findings show that procedures for oocyst recovery from fresh produce mostly involved sample washing and pelleting of the washing eluate by centrifugation, although washing procedures and buffers varied. DNA extraction procedures including mechanical or thermal shocks were identified as necessary steps to break the robust oocyst wall. The most suitable DNA detection protocols rely on qPCR, mostly targeting the B1 gene or the 529 bp repetitive element. When reported, validation data for the different detection methods were not comparable and none of the methods were supported by an interlaboratory comparative study. The results of this review will pave the way for an ongoing development of a widely applicable standard operating procedure.

T1  - Preliminary indoor evidences of microplastic effects on freshwater benthic macroinvertebrates
AN  - 2477089963
AB  - Plastics are to date considered one of the main detrimental drivers for the health of aquatic ecosystems, both in marine and inland waters. Regarding the latter habitat, it seems surprising how the plastic effects on benthic invertebrates are neglected since macroinvertebrates have a long tradition in the water quality assessment activities. In this context, we propose timely indoor observations on the exposure of caddisfly Odontocerum albicorne and mayfly Ephemera danica to various microplastic polymers (ABS, PET, PP, PS, PVDF). Three different experimental designs were performed on caddisflies and mayflies by exposing their larvae to natural and microplastic substrates. Our findings highlighted how microplastics affected both caddisflies in rebuilding its own case (after having removed the natural one) and mayflies burrowing. Particularly, all caddisflies rebuilt cases using the microplastic polymers provided instead of natural items only. Moreover, we provide the first evidence that mayflies burrow mainly in microplastic substrates rather than in natural ones. Our research highlights that macroinvertebrate larvae would use naturally occurring microplastics and this could be of particular concern in freshwaters with high contamination by plastics. Indeed, larvae appear to not necessarily perceive microplastics as a direct stressor. Further studies ought to be conducted to understand the chronic perturbation on larvae fitness and for example, on drift behaviour. Also, further investigations are needed to understand the potentialities of using plastics by benthic macroinvertebrates.

T1  - Extraordinary human energy consumption and resultant geological impacts beginning around 1950 CE initiated the proposed Anthropocene Epoch
AN  - 2528861487
AB  - Growth in fundamental drivers—energy use, economic productivity and population—can provide quantitative indications of the proposed boundary between the Holocene Epoch and the Anthropocene. Human energy expenditure in the Anthropocene, ~22 zetajoules (ZJ), exceeds that across the prior 11,700 years of the Holocene (~14.6 ZJ), largely through combustion of fossil fuels. The global warming effect during the Anthropocene is more than an order of magnitude greater still. Global human population, their productivity and energy consumption, and most changes impacting the global environment, are highly correlated. This extraordinary outburst of consumption and productivity demonstrates how the Earth System has departed from its Holocene state since ~1950 CE, forcing abrupt physical, chemical and biological changes to the Earth’s stratigraphic record that can be used to justify the proposal for naming a new epoch—the Anthropocene.Human energy consumption and productivity have steeply risen around 1950 CE, leading to a departure from the Earth’s Holocene state into the Anthropocene, suggests a quantitative analysis of humanity’s influence on the Earth system.

T1  - An experimental assessment of the distribution of environmental DNA along the water column
AN  - 2506874447
AB  - Abstract
The study of environmental DNA (eDNA) is increasingly becoming a valuable tool to survey and monitor aquatic communities. However, there are important gaps in our understanding of the dynamics governing the distribution of eDNA under natural conditions. In this report we carry out controlled experiments to assess the extent and timing of eDNA distribution along the water column. A sample of known eDNA concentration was placed at the bottom of a 5-m high tube (20 cm in diameter and total volume of 160 L), and water samples were obtained at different depths over an 8 h-period. The presence of the target eDNA was assessed by qPCR analysis. This sampling protocol allowed for assessing the timescale for the diffusion of eDNA while minimizing the influence of turbulence. We demonstrate that, after a time-period of as little as 30 min, the eDNA had spread across the entire container. The implications of these results for eDNA sampling protocols in the field are discussed.

T1  - Accumulation of trace metals in crayfish tissues: is Procambarus clarkii a vector of pollutants in Po Delta inland waters?
AN  - 2469501785
AB  - Concentrations of trace elements (Cd, Pb, As, Cu and Zn) were determined in superficial sediments and in hepatopancreas, exoskeleton, and abdominal muscle of the red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii from several canals of the Po River Delta area. Sediments of the studied canals exhibited some metal pollution. The hepatopancreas of the crayfish showed a higher concentration of trace metals in comparison to the other tissues at all sites under scrutiny. Concentrations of As and Pb, either in sediment and P. clarkii tissues, were probably related to the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Moreover, the levels of certain metals accumulated in the abdominal muscle (Pb, Cu and Zn) exceeded the threshold values considered harmful to human health. The Toxic Contamination Index, depending on the bioaccumulation data of hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle, allowed us to assess the toxicity by heavy metals of sediments measuring the stress level of the detoxification organ, and resulted in >1 only at two sampling canals. We hypothesize that P. clarkii in the Po River Delta aquatic communities can act as a vector of pollutants, as crayfish can transfer their relatively high amount of heavy metals to higher trophic levels.

T1  - The acute toxicity effects of hexavalent chromium in antioxidant system and gonad development to male clam Geloina coaxans
AN  - 2469501674
AB  - Hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a harmful environmental pollutant, which is widely distributed in the marine environment. However, the mechanisms underlying Cr-induced oxidative stress and reproductive toxicity in clams remain largely unknown. The objective of this study was to explore the acute toxic effects of Cr(VI) and estimate the applicability of male clam Geloina coaxans as a bioindicator in mangrove ecosystems. In this study, G. coaxans were exposed to 4.34, 8,69, 17.38 and 34.76 mg/L Cr(VI) for 24, 48 and 72 h. The activities of catalase (CAT), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined. The gene expression of CAT, GST, autophagy-related gene 5 (ATG5), cyclin B3 and spermatogenesis associated protein 4 (SAP4) were measured by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, histological alteration of the gonad and sperm was observed by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy.The results showed that Cr(VI) exposure induced the accumulation of MDA and activities of enzymes. Cr(VI) exposure also inhibited the mRNA expression of ATG5, cyclin B3 and SAP4 in a dose-dependent manner, which might suggest that Cr(VI) caused reproductive toxicity by affecting gene expression. Significant changes in the histological structure of gonad were observed. The results demonstrate that Cr(VI) significantly affected functional and molecular parameters in Geloina coaxans, and indicate that gonad represents the target of exposure to Cr(VI).

T1  - NATURE-INSPIRED LEADERSHIP - SEEKING HUMAN-TECHNOLOGY-EARTH HARMONY
AN  - 2463701022
AB  - "Gaan na die mier, ... kyk na sy wee en word wys!" (Spreuke 6:6). Ons het baie vooruitgang getoon deur natuurnabootsing te gebruik in ons ingenieursontwerpe en -prosesse. Ons het egter min geleer om ons inspirasie in die natuur te kry om leiers in ons komplekse wereld te wees. In die natuur is dit die spesie wat leer deur waar te neem, te luister, sin te maak, in te neem, te dink en op die regte tye te rus wat oorleef en floreer in hulle omgewings - op vlaktes, in berge, die bos, riviere, oseane, woestyne en die lug. Veg of vlug gebeur in beide die natuur en in besigheid. Uitdagings word gedeel in saambestaan, geduld, uithouvermoe, veerkragtigheid, en aanpassing. Leierskap uitdagings wat na vore kom in die nuwe wereld van die saambestaan van mens en masjien word ook verryk deur lesse uit die natuur wat nuwe gedrag inspireer. Hierdie lesse word nie in bestuurskole of kulturele nalatenskap geleer nie, maar in natuurlike oplossings wat vir miljoene jare plooibaar, effektief en doeltreffend is. Ons bespreek die grondslag van 'n konseptuele denkmodel van leierskap wat deur die natuur gei'nspireer is. Dit gee ? beginpunt om ? bewustheid te skep van hoe natuurgeinspireerde leierskap aangewend kan word. Enigiets wat vanuit die natuur gemodelleer word, moet verstaan word teen die agtergrond dat modelle vereenvoudigings is van die werklikheid in die natuur, wat n komplekse stelsel is, en dat dit nie ten volle verstaan word nie. Ons doelwit moet nooit wees om die natuur te kopieer nie, maar om beginsels daaruit te onttrek.Alternate abstract:"Go to the ant, ... consider its ways and be wise!" (Proverbs 6:6). We have progressed using biomimicry to inform our engineering designs and processes. Yet we have learnt very little in finding our inspiration from nature for leading in our complex world. In nature, those species that learn by observing, listening, making sense, internalising, thinking, and resting at the right time, survive and thrive in their environments - on plains, in mountains, in the bush, rivers, oceans, deserts, and the sky. Fight or flight takes place in both nature and business. Challenges are shared in coexistence, patience, perseverance, resilience, and adaptation. Leadership challenges that are emerging in the new world of human and machine coexistence will also be enriched by lessons from nature that inspire new behaviour, that are not conceived in business schools or legacy cultures, but that are flexible, effective, and work efficiently - as natural solutions have done for millennia. We discuss the makings of a conceptual thought model of leadership inspired by nature. It is a starting point to create an awareness of how nature-inspired leadership may be applied. Yet, when modelling anything on nature, one has to realise that all models are simplifications, which means that nature itself, as a complex system, is not fully understood. Our aim should not be to copy nature, but to extract principles from it.

T1  - Microplastic Pollution in Deep-Sea Sediments From the Great Australian Bight
AN  - 2448478075
AB  - Interest in understanding the extent of plastic and specifically microplastic pollution has increased on a global scale. Still one large piece of the overall puzzle currently lacks: how much plastic pollution has found its way into the deeper areas of the world’s oceans? The extent of microplastic pollution in deep-sea sediments remains poorly quantified, but this knowledge is imperative for predicting the distribution and potential impacts of global plastic pollution. We quantified microplastics in deep-sea sediments from the Great Australian Bight using an adapted density separation and dye fluorescence technique. We analyzed sediment cores from six locations ranging in ocean depths from 1,655 to 3,062 m and offshore distances ranging from 288 to 356 km from the Australian coastline. Microplastic counts ranged from 0 to 13.6 fragments g-1 dry sediment (mean of 1.26 ± 0.68; n = 51). We found higher microplastic counts than recorded in other microplastic analyses of deep-sea sediments. Sample fragments were identified as polyisoprene, polyurethane, polyester, and polypropylene. A statistical analysis detected a relationship between sediment microplastic counts and the amount of plastic floating on the ocean surface above, as well as with the angle of the seafloor slope. The number of microplastic fragments in the sediment increased as surface plastic counts increased, and as the seafloor slope angle increased. Overall, however, the microplastic counts were highly variable, with variation between sediment cores at the same location being greater than the variation across the sampling sites. Our findings of microplastics in deep-sea sediment from the Great Australian Bight contributes to understanding where some of the ‘hidden’ oceanic plastic pollution is distributed.

T1  - DNA damage and health effects in juvenile haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) exposed to PAHs associated with oil-polluted sediment or produced water
AN  - 2453677136
AB  - The research objective was to study the presence of DNA damages in haddock exposed to petrogenic or pyrogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from different sources: 1) extracts of oil produced water (PW), dominated by 2-ring PAHs; 2) distillation fractions of crude oil (representing oil-based drilling mud), dominated by 3-ring PAHs; 3) heavy pyrogenic PAHs, mixture of 4/5/6-ring PAHs. The biological effect of the different PAH sources was studied by feeding juvenile haddock with low doses of PAHs (0.3–0.7 mg PAH/kg fish/day) for two months, followed by a two-months recovery. In addition to the oral exposure, a group of fish was exposed to 12 single compounds of PAHs (4/5/6-ring) via intraperitoneal injection. The main endpoint was the analysis of hepatic and intestinal DNA adducts. In addition, PAH burden in liver, bile metabolites, gene and protein expression of CYP1A, GST activity, lipid peroxidation, skeletal deformities and histopathology of livers were evaluated. Juvenile haddock responded quickly to both intraperitoneal injection and oral exposure of 4/5/6-ring PAHs. High levels of DNA adducts were detected in livers three days after the dose of the single compound exposure. Fish had also high levels of DNA adducts in liver after being fed with extracts dominated by 2-ring PAHs (a PW exposure scenario) and 3-ring PAHs (simulating an oil exposure scenario). Elevated levels of DNA adducts were observed in the liver of all exposed groups after the 2 months of recovery. High levels of DNA adduct were found also in the intestines of individuals exposed to oil or heavy PAHs, but not in the PW or control groups. This suggests that the intestinal barrier is very important for detoxification of orally exposures of PAHs.

T1  - Scope for growth of cultivated Pacific and Gulf of California populations of lion's paw scallop Nodipecten subnodosus, and their reciprocal transplants
AN  - 2447590812
AB  - In the present work, the relative effects of the season (early vs. late summer), site (Gulf vs. Pacific study sites), the population of origin (Gulf vs. Pacific) and associated abiotic variables were determined in two geographically-separated Nodipecten subnodosus populations and their reciprocal transplants, through the scope for growth (SFG) and net growth efficiency (K2) using a portable open-flow system. Results indicate that both energy acquisition and expenditure were significantly affected by season, site, and population factors. Scallop energy acquisition and growth efficiency were highest during the earlier, cooler part of the summer and higher at the Pacific site where food availability was highest. Significantly higher respiration rates were measured for the Pacific scallop population, leading to significantly lower net growth efficiency than scallops of Gulf origin, which indicates a physiological advantage for Gulf scallops during the suboptimal growth conditions present during summer months on both coasts of the Baja California peninsula. It may have important implications for aquaculture enterprises in this region, and may also confirm the genetic divergence between these two geographically separated populations. The advantages of the open-flow system for in situ ecophysiological studies in aquatic organisms are discussed.

T1  - Bodensee:&nbsp;Ökologie und anthropogene Belastungen eines tiefen Voralpensees
AN  - 2434215829
AB  - Die Autoren fassen den aktuellen Kenntnisstand zur Limnologie und Ökologie des Bodensees und seiner Belastungen zusammen. Die letzte solche Zusammenfassung war aus dem Jahr 1966 (Kiefer, 1955), vor mehr als 60 Jahren. Ausgehend von einer Übersicht über die limnologische Forschungsgeschichte werden das Einzugsgebiet, die geologischen, hydrographischen, physikalischen und chemischen Bedingungen im See sowie die ihn bewohnenden Lebensgemeinschaften in den drei großen Lebensräumen Pelagial, Litoral und Profundal beschrieben. Als Teilaspekte anthropogener Belastungen werden die Eutrophierungsgeschichte, der Klimawandel, Mikroverunreinigungen, Eingriffe in den Wasserhaushalt, strukturelle Defizite der Ufer- und Flachwasserzone, die Problematik der Besiedlung durch Neophyten und Neozoen sowie sein hygienischer Zustand zusammenfassend dargestellt. In einer abschließenden Standortbestimmung wird der Stand des Gewässerschutzes und verbleibende Wissensdefizite diskutiert. Der Bodensee ist ein typischer nährstoffarmer und tiefer Voralpensee. Als einer der großen Seen Mitteleuropas ist er nicht nur als Trinkwasserspeicher der Bodenseewasserversorgung für mehr als 5 Millionen Menschen bedeutsam, sondern auch mit seiner ihn umgebenden Landschaft Anziehungspunkt vieler Touristen. Nicht zuletzt ist und war der Bodensee als wichtiges und empfindliches Ökosystem Gegenstand zahlreicher limnologischer Untersuchungen. Aufgrund der durchgängig seit dem Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts bis heute durchgeführten umfassenden Untersuchungen ist er einer der bestuntersuchten Seen weltweit. Mehr als 60 Jahre nach F. Kiefers "Naturkunde des Bodensees" haben die Autoren mit diesem Band eine umfassende aktualisierte Zusammenfassung der Limnologie des Bodensees vorgelegt. Sie richtet sich an Fachleute aus Limnologie und Gewässerschutz - aber auch an Regionalplaner und die naturwissenschaftlich interessierte Allgemeinheit. Rezension 1955 erschien von dem Zoologen und Gymnasiallehrer Friedrich Kiefer „Naturkunde des Bodensees“, ein Buch, das die „Ergebnisse der naturwissenschaftlichen Bodenseeforschung in allgemeinverständlicher Weise darstellt“. Hierauf beziehen sich die Autoren der vorliegenden Veröffentlichung, einer aktuellen Übersicht über die Limnologie des Bodensees für interessierte Laien wie für Fachleute. Angaben zu Landschaft, Klima und Einzugsgebiet bilden den Rahmen, gefolgt von physiographischen, hydrologischen und chemischen Daten des Sees. Die Beschreibungen der Lebensgemeinschaften betreffen die des Freiwassers, des Ufers und des Flachwassers sowie des tiefen Seebodens mit einer gesonderten Betrachtung der Neozoen und Neophyten im See. Weiter werden Stoffkreislauf und Energiefluss über die Organismen betrachtet. In den Hintergrund tritt dabei der faunistische und floristische Aspekt, auch, was die Literaturzitate betrifft; Listen, der bisher im Bodensee registrierten Tier- und Pflanzenarten hätten den Umfang des Buches nicht wesentlich vergrößert. Breit dargestellt werden aus gutem Grund die anthropogenen Belastungen, ist doch der See mit seinen Ufern und das Umland bei aller Schönheit seit Jahrhunderten stark genutzt und vielfach auch übernutzt mit Auswirkungen auf den abiotischen und biotischen Zustand des Sees. So wird dieser Abschnitt eingeleitet mit einer Information über die Internationale Gewässerschutzkommission für den Bodensee und ihre Vorläufer. Ausführlich behandelt wird die Belastung des Sees durch die Nährstoffe Phosphor und Stickstoff, d.h. die trophische Situation und ihre Entwicklung. Weitere Abschnitte befassen sich mit den Mikroverunreinigungen, dem Einfluss des Klimawandels, wasserbaulichen Maßnahmen am See und an den Zuflüssen mit ihrem Einfluss auf das Regime, der Belastung der Uferzone und hygienischen Aspekten. Vorangestellt ist ein kurzer Abriss der 150-jährigen Erforschungsgeschichte des Bodensees. Eine Bewertung des Istzustandes mit einem Ausblick beschließen das Buch. Herausgeber Lauterbornia 82 (2017) Der Bodensee gehört zu den am besten untersuchten Gewässern in Deutschland und weist viele Langzeituntersuchungen auf. Die Autoren haben sich die schwierige Aufgabe gestellt, eine gleichermaßen für interessierte Laien als auch für Fachleute möglichst verständliche Informationsquelle über die Untersuchungsergebnisse zur Verfügung zu stellen. Neben den Themen Landnutzung, Beckenmorphologie, Wasserhaushalt, Schichtungsentwicklung, biotische Stoff- und Energieflüsse sowie Wasserchemismus werden vor allem die Lebensgemeinschaften des Freiwassers, der Uferzone und des tiefen Seebodens beschrieben. Gut ein D rittel des Buches wird den anthropogenen Belastungen gewidmet und Maßnahmekonzepte vorgestellt. Wer mehr wissen möchte, wird auf 18 Seiten mit Literaturangaben verwiesen. Die Autoren haben eine umfangreiche Zusammenschau relevanter Forschungsergebnisse erstellt und damit ihr Ziel mit "Bravour" erreicht. Otter-Post 01/2017

T1  - Anthropocene geochemistry of metals in sediment cores from the Laurentian Great Lakes
AN  - 2398997645
AB  - Geochemical analyses applied to lake sedimentary records can reveal the history of pollution by metals and the effects of remedial efforts. Lakes provide ideal environments for geochemical studies because they have steady deposition of fine grained material suitable for fixation of pollutants. The Laurentian Great Lakes are the most studied system in this field, and they have well-preserved chronological profiles. To date, this important system has been considered in parts for inorganic geochemistry, hampering basin-wide conclusions regarding metal contamination. We filled spatial and temporal gaps in a comprehensive geochemical analysis of 11 sediment cores collected from all five Great Lakes. Hierarchical cluster analysis of all Great Lakes samples divided the metal analytes into five functional groups: (1) carbonate elements; (2) metals and oxides with diverse natural sources, including a subgroup of analytes known to be anthropogenically enriched (Cd, Pb, Sn, Zn, and Sb); (3) common crustal elements; (4) metals related to coal and nuclear power generation; and (5) all of the co-occurring rare earth elements. Two contamination indices (Igeo and EF) applied to sedimentary metals indicated that Na, Co, Mn, Cd, Pb, Ta, and Cu were each, at some point during the Anthropocene, the most enriched metal pollutants in Great Lakes sediments. Land uses correlated with the metal analytes, such as increases in contaminant metals with the rise in catchment population and increases in carbonate elements (e.g. Ca) with agriculture. Certain contamination trends were observed basin-wide, such as for the atmospheric pollutant Pb, which followed a rise associated with fossil fuel combustion and a decline following the ban of leaded gasoline. Other trends were lake-specific, such as recent high concentrations of Na in Lake Superior, likely due to road salt applications, and a late-20th-century peak in Ca associated with algal whiting events in Lake Ontario. Some metals exceeded guidelines for sediment quality, in some cases prior to European settlement of the basin, indicating that a paleolimnological context is important for appropriate management of sediment contamination. The Great Lakes are sensitive to environmental changes such as pollution by metals, and it is clear that while there has been remedial success, results from the uppermost intervals of cores indicate ongoing problems.

T1  - Transcriptome analysis of Catarina scallop (Argopecten ventricosus) juveniles treated with highly-diluted immunomodulatory compounds reveals activation of non-self-recognition system
AN  - 2403019549
AB  - Marine bivalve hatchery productivity is continuously challenged by apparition and propagation of new diseases, mainly those related to vibriosis. Disinfectants and antibiotics are frequently overused to prevent pathogen presence, generating a potential negative impact on the environment. Recently, the use of highly diluted compounds with immunostimulant properties in marine organisms has been trailed successfully to activate the self-protection mechanisms of marine bivalves. Despite their potential as immunostimulants, little is known about their way of action. To understand their effect, a comparative transcriptomic analysis was performed with Argopecten ventricosus juveniles. The experimental design consisted of four treatments formulated from pathogenic Vibrio lysates at two dilutions: [(T1) Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus 1D; (T2) V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus 7C]; minerals [(T3) PhA+SiT 7C], scorpion venom [(T4) ViT 31C]; and one control (C1) hydro-alcoholic solution (ethanol 1%). The RNA sequencing (RNAseq) analysis showed a higher modulation of differentially expressed genes (DEG) in mantle tissue compared to gill tissue. The scallops that showed a higher number of DEG related to immune response in mantle tissue corresponded to T1 (V. parahaemolyticus and V. alginolyticus lysate) and T3 (Silicea terra® - Phosphoric acid®). The transcriptome analysis allowed understanding some interactions between A. ventricosus juveniles and highly-diluted treatments.

T1  - Mechanistic molecular responses of the giant clam Tridacna crocea to Vibrio coralliilyticus challenge
AN  - 2388310380
AB  - Vibrio coralliilyticus is a pathogen of coral and mollusk, contributing to dramatic losses worldwide. In our study, we found that V. coralliilyticus challenge could directly affect adult Tridacna crocea survival; there were dead individuals appearing at 6 h post infection, and there were 45.56% and 56.78% mortality rates in challenged groups after 36 h of infection. The apoptosis rate of hemocytes was significantly increased by 1.8-fold at 6 h after V. coralliilyticus injection. To shed light on the mechanistic molecular responses of T. crocea to V. coralliilyticus infection, we used transcriptome sequencing analysis and other relevant techniques to analyze T. crocea hemocytes at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after V. coralliilyticus challenge. Our results revealed that the total numbers of unigenes and DEGs were 195651 and 3446, respectively. Additional details were found by KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, where DEGs were significantly enriched in immune-related signaling pathways, such as the TLR signaling pathway, and some were associated with signaling related to apoptosis. Quantitative validation results illustrated that with exposure to V. coralliilyticus, the expression of TLR pathway members, TLR, MyD88, IRAK4, TRAF6, and IкB-α, were significantly upregulated (by 22.9-, 9.6-, 4.0-, 3.6-, and 3.9-fold, respectively) at 6 h. The cytokine-related gene IL-17 exhibited an increase of 6.3-fold and 10.5-fold at 3 h and 6 h, respectively. The apoptosis-related gene IAP1 was dramatically increased by 2.99-fold at 6 h. These results indicate that adult T. crocea could initiate the TLR pathway to resist V. coralliilyticus, which promotes the release of inflammatory factors such as IL-17 and leads to the activation of a series of outcomes, such as apoptosis. The response mechanism is related to the T. crocea immunoreaction stimulated by V. coralliilyticus, providing a theoretical basis for understanding T. crocea immune response mechanisms.

T1  - Acclimation temperature affects thermal reaction norms for energy reserves in Drosophila
AN  - 2473301633
AB  - Organisms have evolved various physiological mechanisms to cope with unfavourable environmental conditions. The ability to tolerate non-optimal thermal conditions can be substantially improved by acclimation. In this study, we examined how an early-life acclimation to different temperatures (19 °C, 25 °C and 29 °C) influences thermal reaction norms for energy stores in Drosophila adults. Our results show that acclimation temperature has a significant effect on the amount of stored fat and glycogen (and their relative changes) and the optimal temperature for their accumulation. Individuals acclimated to 19 °C had, on average, more energy reserves than flies that were initially maintained at 25 °C or 29 °C. In addition, acclimation caused a shift in optimal temperature for energy stores towards acclimation temperature. We also detected significant population differences in this response. The effect of acclimation on the optimal temperature for energy stores was more pronounced in flies from the temperate climate zone (Slovakia) than in individuals from the tropical zone (India). Overall, we found that the acclimation effect was stronger after acclimation to low (19 °C) than to high (29 °C) temperature. The observed sensitivity of thermal reaction norms for energy reserves to acclimation temperature can have important consequences for surviving periods of food scarcity, especially at suboptimal temperatures.

T1  - QCM Sensor Arrays, Electroanalytical Techniques and NIR Spectroscopy Coupled to Multivariate Analysis for Quality Assessment of Food Products, Raw Materials, Ingredients and Foodborne Pathogen Detection: Challenges and Breakthroughs
AN  - 2469476296
AB  - Quality checks, assessments, and the assurance of food products, raw materials, and food ingredients is critically important to ensure the safeguard of foods of high quality for safety and public health. Nevertheless, quality checks, assessments, and the assurance of food products along distribution and supply chains is impacted by various challenges. For instance, the development of portable, sensitive, low-cost, and robust instrumentation that is capable of real-time, accurate, and sensitive analysis, quality checks, assessments, and the assurance of food products in the field and/or in the production line in a food manufacturing industry is a major technological and analytical challenge. Other significant challenges include analytical method development, method validation strategies, and the non-availability of reference materials and/or standards for emerging food contaminants. The simplicity, portability, non-invasive, non-destructive properties, and low-cost of NIR spectrometers, make them appealing and desirable instruments of choice for rapid quality checks, assessments and assurances of food products, raw materials, and ingredients. This review article surveys literature and examines current challenges and breakthroughs in quality checks and the assessment of a variety of food products, raw materials, and ingredients. Specifically, recent technological innovations and notable advances in quartz crystal microbalances (QCM), electroanalytical techniques, and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopic instrument development in the quality assessment of selected food products, and the analysis of food raw materials and ingredients for foodborne pathogen detection between January 2019 and July 2020 are highlighted. In addition, chemometric approaches and multivariate analyses of spectral data for NIR instrumental calibration and sample analyses for quality assessments and assurances of selected food products and electrochemical methods for foodborne pathogen detection are discussed. Moreover, this review provides insight into the future trajectory of innovative technological developments in QCM, electroanalytical techniques, NIR spectroscopy, and multivariate analyses relating to general applications for the quality assessment of food products.

T1  - Crime Prediction with Historical Crime and Movement Data of Potential Offenders Using a Spatio-Temporal Cokriging Method
AN  - 2469474533
AB  - Crime prediction using machine learning and data fusion assimilation has become a hot topic. Most of the models rely on historical crime data and related environment variables. The activity of potential offenders affects the crime patterns, but the data with fine resolution have not been applied in the crime prediction. The goal of this study is to test the effect of the activity of potential offenders in the crime prediction by combining this data in the prediction models and assessing the prediction accuracies. This study uses the movement data of past offenders collected in routine police stop-and-question operations to infer the movement of future offenders. The offender movement data compensates historical crime data in a Spatio-Temporal Cokriging (ST-Cokriging) model for crime prediction. The models are implemented for weekly, biweekly, and quad-weekly prediction in the XT police district of ZG city, China. Results with the incorporation of the offender movement data are consistently better than those without it. The improvement is most pronounced for the weekly model, followed by the biweekly model, and the quad-weekly model. In sum, the addition of offender movement data enhances crime prediction, especially for short periods.

T1  - A Review of the Ecomorphology of Pinnotherine Pea Crabs (Brachyura: Pinnotheridae), with an Updated List of Symbiont-Host Associations
AN  - 2462696718
AB  - Almost all pea crab species in the subfamily Pinnotherinae (Decapoda: Brachyura: Pinnotheridae) are considered obligatory endo- or ectosymbionts, living in a mutualistic or parasitic relationship with a wide variety of invertebrate hosts, including bivalves, gastropods, echinoids, holothurians, and ascidians. While the subfamily is regarded as one of the most morphologically adapted groups of symbiotic crabs, the functionality of these adaptations in relation to their lifestyles has not been reviewed before. Available information on the ecomorphological adaptations of various pinnotherine crab species and their functionality was compiled in order to clarify their ecological diversity. These include the size, shape, and ornamentations of the carapace, the frontal appendages and mouthparts, the cheliped morphology, the ambulatory legs, and the reproductive anatomy and larval characters. The phylogenetic relevance of the adaptations is also reviewed and suggestions for future studies are made. Based on an updated list of all known pinnotherine symbiont–host associations and the available phylogenetic reconstructions, it is concluded that, due to convergent evolution, unrelated species with a similar host interaction might display the same morphological adaptations.

T1  - Reconstruction of ancient homeobox gene linkages inferred from a new high-quality assembly of the Hong Kong oyster (Magallana hongkongensis) genome
AN  - 2451832134
AB  - Background 
Homeobox-containing genes encode crucial transcription factors involved in animal, plant and fungal development, and changes to homeobox genes have been linked to the evolution of novel body plans and morphologies. In animals, some homeobox genes are clustered together in the genome, either as remnants from ancestral genomic arrangements, or due to coordinated gene regulation. Consequently, analyses of homeobox gene organization across animal phylogeny provide important insights into the evolution of genome organization and developmental gene control, and their interaction. However, homeobox gene organization remains to be fully elucidated in several key animal ancestors, including those of molluscs, lophotrochozoans and bilaterians.
 Results 
Here, we present a high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of the Hong Kong oyster, Magallana hongkongensis (2n = 20), for which 93.2% of the genomic sequences are contained on 10 pseudomolecules (~ 758 Mb, scaffold N50 = 72.3 Mb). Our genome assembly was scaffolded using Hi-C reads, facilitating a larger scaffold size compared to the recently published M. hongkongensis genome of Peng et al. (Mol Ecol Resources, 2020), which was scaffolded using the Crassostrea gigas assembly. A total of 46,963 predicted gene models (45,308 protein coding genes) were incorporated in our genome, and genome completeness estimated by BUSCO was 94.6%. Homeobox gene linkages were analysed in detail relative to available data for other mollusc lineages.
 Conclusions 
The analyses performed in this study and the accompanying genome sequence provide important genetic resources for this economically and culturally valuable oyster species, and offer a platform to improve understanding of animal biology and evolution more generally. Transposable element content is comparable to that found in other mollusc species, contrary to the conclusion of another recent analysis. Also, our chromosome-level assembly allows the inference of ancient gene linkages (synteny) for the homeobox-containing genes, even though a number of the homeobox gene clusters, like the Hox/ParaHox clusters, are undergoing dispersal in molluscs such as this oyster.

T1  - Assessment of Water Quality Using Chemometrics and Multivariate Statistics: A Case Study in Chaobai River Replenished by Reclaimed Water, North China
AN  - 2443348373
AB  - Dry rivers could be effectively recovered by reclaimed water in North China, while river water quality would be an important issue. Therefore, it is important to understand the spatiotemporal variation and controlling factors of river water. Water samples were collected during March, May, July, September, and November in the year 2010, then 20 parameters were analyzed. The water environment was oxidizing and alkaline, which was beneficial for nitrification. Nitrate was the main nitrogen form. Depleted and enriched isotopes were found in reclaimed water and river water, respectively. Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) of reclaimed water exceed the threshold of reclaimed water reuse standard and Class V in the surface water quality criteria. Most river water was at the severe eutrophication level. The sodium adsorption ratio indicated a medium harmful level for irrigation purpose. Significant spatial and temporal variation was explored by cluster analysis. Five months and nine stations were both classified into two distinct clusters. It was found that 6 parameters (chloride: Cl−, sulphate: SO42−, potassium: K+, sodium: Na+, magnesium: Mg2+, and total dissolved solids: TDS) had significant upward temporal variation, and 12 parameters (dissolved oxygen: DO, electric conductivity: EC, bicarbonate: HCO3−, K+, Na+, Ca2+, TDS, nitrite-nitrogen: NO2-N, nitrate nitrogen: NO3-N, TN, TP, and chlorophyll a: Chl.a) and 4 parameters (Mg2+, ammonia nitrogen: NH3-N, and the oxygen-18 and hydron-2 stable isotope: δ18O and δ2H) had a significant downward and upward spatial trend, respectively. The Gibbs plot showed that river water chemistry was mainly controlled by a water–rock interaction. The ionic relationship and principal component analysis showed that river water had undergone the dissolution of carbonate, calcite, and silicate minerals, cation exchange, a process of nitrification, photosynthesis of phytoplankton, and stable isotope enrichment. In addition, gypsum and salt rock have a potential dissolution process.

T1  - Hg Levels in Marine Porifera of Montecristo and Giglio Islands (Tuscan Archipelago, Italy)
AN  - 2418796074
AB  - Porifera are filter-feeding organisms known to bioaccumulate different contaminants in their tissues. The presence of mercury (Hg) has been reported in different Mediterranean species, mainly collected in the southern coast of France. In the present study, mercury concentrations in the tissue of the sponges of Montecristo and Giglio, two islands of Tuscany Archipelago National Park (TANP), are presented for the first time. Analyses of total mercury content were performed by Direct Mercury Analyzer. Statistical differences have been reported in the Hg concentrations of species collected in both islands, but they do not appear related to the anthropic impacts of the islands. Among the collected species, a high intra- and inter-variability have been recorded, with Cliona viridis showing the lowest concentration (0.0167–0.033 mg·kg−1 dry weight), and Chondrosia reniformis and Sarcotragus spinosulus the highest (0.57 ± 0.15 and 0.64 ± 0.01 mg·kg−1 dry weight, respectively). The variability of Hg measured did not allow us to identify sponges as bioindicators of toxic elements. Anyway, these results improve knowledge on the ecosystem of the TANP, underlining the species-specificity of metal concentrations for Porifera, and providing additional data to address the main input of the Marine Strategy guidelines to protect coasts, seas and oceans.

T1  - Delayed Release of Intracellular Microcystin Following Partial Oxidation of Cultured and Naturally Occurring Cyanobacteria
AN  - 2406255965
AB  - Oxidation processes can provide an effective barrier to eliminate cyanotoxins by damaging cyanobacteria cell membranes, releasing intracellular cyanotoxins, and subsequently oxidizing these toxins (now in extracellular form) based on published reaction kinetics. In this work, cyanobacteria cells from two natural blooms (from the United States and Canada) and a laboratory-cultured Microcystis aeruginosa strain were treated with chlorine, monochloramine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, and potassium permanganate. The release of microcystin was measured immediately after oxidation (t ≤ 20 min), and following oxidant residual quenching (stagnation times = 96 or 168 h). Oxidant exposures (CT) were determined resulting in complete release of intracellular microcystin following chlorine (21 mg-min/L), chloramine (72 mg-min/L), chlorine dioxide (58 mg-min/L), ozone (4.1 mg-min/L), and permanganate (391 mg-min/L). Required oxidant exposures using indigenous cells were greater than lab-cultured Microcystis. Following partial oxidation of cells (oxidant exposures ≤ CT values cited above), additional intracellular microcystin and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were released while the samples remained stagnant in the absence of an oxidant (>96 h after quenching). The delayed release of microcystin from partially oxidized cells has implications for drinking water treatment as these cells may be retained on a filter surface or in solids and continue to slowly release cyanotoxins and other metabolites into the finished water.

T1  - Assessment and Monitoring of Fish Quality from a Coastal Ecosystem under High Anthropic Pressure: A Case Study in Southern Italy
AN  - 2401954766
AB  - Fish is a nutrient-rich food but, at the same time, consumption of fish is a possible source of exposure to heavy metals. Since many coastal Mediterranean areas suffer from great anthropomorphic pressure, the aim of this study was to assess the level of potentially toxic inorganic elements in different fish samples from the coastal zone of Southern Italy (Gela) where there is a high mortality rate linked to cancer disease and congenital malformations. The presence of mercury, cadmium, lead, nickel, arsenic, vanadium, and chromium was measured by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The risk assessment was evaluated in terms of estimated daily intake by calculating the amount of potentially toxic elements that an average individual adult weighing 60 kg would ingest. Moreover the non-carcinogenic risk was estimated by target hazard quotient (THQ). The study evidenced significant contamination by inorganic elements, especially cadmium, which can be linked to industrial pollution. The THQ indexes, as indicators of human health, suggest that the consumption of fish from the study area is not free of risk.

T1  - Biological Removal and Fate Assessment of Diclofenac Using Bacillus subtilis and Brevibacillus laterosporus Strains and Ecotoxicological Effects of Diclofenac and 4′-Hydroxy-diclofenac
AN  - 2400274744
AB  - Since bacterial consortia involved in conventional wastewater treatment processes are not efficient in removing diclofenac (DCF), an emerging pollutant frequently detected in water bodies, the identification of microorganisms able to metabolise this pharmaceutical compound is relevant. Thus, DCF removal was investigated using bacteria isolated from aqueous stock solutions of this micropollutant and identified as Bacillus and Brevibacillus species using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A 100% DCF removal was achieved after 17 hours of experiment at 20°C in a nutrient medium; the biodegradation kinetic followed a pseudo-first order (kbiol = 11 L·gSS−1·d−1). Quantitative assessment of DCF removal showed that its main route was biotic degradation. The main degradation product of DCF, 4′-hydroxy-diclofenac (4′-OH-DCF), was identified using liquid chromatography-electrospray ionisation high-resolution mass spectrometry. Since the ecotoxicological impact of 4′-hydroxy-diclofenac was not reported in the literature, the ecotoxicity of DCF and its metabolite were tentatively evaluated using Vibrio fischeri bioassays. Results from these tests showed that this metabolite is not more toxic than its parent compound and may hopefully be an intermediate product in the DCF transformation. Indeed, no significant difference in ecotoxicity was observed after 30 min between DCF (50 should be writtten in subscript all along the manuscript in EC50 = 23 ± 4 mg·L−1) and 4′-hydroxy-diclofenac (EC50 = 19 ± 2 mg·L−1). Besides, the study highlighted a limit of the Microtox® bioassay, which is largely used to assess ecotoxicity. The bioluminescence of Vibrio fischeri was impacted due to the production of microbial activity and the occurrence of some carbon source in the studied medium.

T1  - Levels of Octachlorostyrene in Mothers’ Milk and Potential Exposure Among Infants in Sendai City, Japan 2012
AN  - 2397324529
AB  - Persistent organic pollutants can accumulate inside the human body, including in mothers’ milk, which may affect infant development. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine selected persistent organic pollutants in the milk of 100 mothers in Sendai city, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. We used gas-chromatography-electron capture negative chemical ionization-mass spectrometry to check for octachlorostyrene, dechlorane (Dec) plus, Dec 602, Dec 603, and Dec 604. Octachlorostyrene was detected in 86 samples at more than the method detection limit (84 pg g-lipid−1) but no dechloranes were above the method detection limit (1 ng mL−1 for dechlorane plus, Dec 602, and Dec 603; 20 ng mL−1 for Dec 604). The mean octachlorostyrene concentration was 461 pg g-lipid−1, the median was 337 pg g-lipid−1, and the standard deviation 450 pg g-lipid−1. No baseline characteristics were associated with octachlorostyrene level except for mother’s occupation (stay-at-home mother, 353 ± 327 pg g-lipid−1; others, 531 ± 509 pg g-lipid−1). Octachlorostyrene was also significantly negatively correlated with lipid content (r = −0.35, p = 0.0004). However, the maximum intake of octachlorostyrene among infants in this study (3.5 ng/kg/day) was under the acceptable daily intake (30 ng/kg/day, derived from 12−month study in rats), and is therefore unlikely to pose a health risk.

T1  - The survey and reference assisted assembly of the Octopus vulgaris genome
AN  - 2201693511
AB  - The common octopus, Octopus vulgaris, is an active marine predator known for the richness and plasticity of its behavioral repertoire, and remarkable learning and memory capabilities. Octopus and other coleoid cephalopods, cuttlefish and squid, possess the largest nervous system among invertebrates, both for cell counts and body to brain size. O. vulgaris has been at the center of a long-tradition of research into diverse aspects of its biology. To leverage research in this iconic species, we generated 270 Gb of genomic sequencing data, complementing those available for the only other sequenced congeneric octopus, Octopus bimaculoides. We show that both genomes are similar in size, but display different levels of heterozygosity and repeats. Our data give a first quantitative glimpse into the rate of coding and non-coding regions and support the view that hundreds of novel genes may have arisen independently despite the close phylogenetic distance. We furthermore describe a reference-guided assembly and an open genomic resource (CephRes-gdatabase), opening new avenues in the study of genomic novelties in cephalopods and their biology.Design Type(s)species comparison design • sequence analysis objective • sequence assembly objectiveMeasurement Type(s)whole genome sequencing assayTechnology Type(s)DNA sequencingFactor Type(s) Sample Characteristic(s)Octopus vulgaris • testis • ocean biomeMachine-accessible metadata file describing the reported data (ISA-Tab format)

T1  - Transcriptome-wide identification and characterization of the Sox gene family and microsatellites for Corbicula fluminea
AN  - 2334548450
AB  - The Asian clam, Corbicula fluminea, is a commonly consumed small freshwater bivalve in East Asia. However, available genetic information of this clam is still limited. In this study, the transcriptome of female  C. fluminea was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. A total of 89,563 unigenes were assembled with an average length of 859 bp, and 36.7% of them were successfully annotated. Six members of Sox gene family namely SoxB1, SoxB2, SoxC, SoxD, SoxE and SoxF were identified. Based on these genes, the divergence time of C. fluminea was estimated to be around  476 million years ago. Furthermore, a total of 3,117 microsatellites were detected with a distribution density of 1:12,960 bp. Fifty of these microsatellites were randomly selected for validation, and 45 of them were successfully amplified with 31 polymorphic ones. The data obtained in this study will provide useful information for future genetic and genomic studies in C. fluminea.

T1  - Convergent Evolution on Earth:&nbsp;Lessons for the Search for Extraterrestrial Life
AN  - 2308253822
AB  - An analysis of patterns of convergent evolution on Earth that suggests where we might look for similar convergent forms on other planets. 
Why does a sea lily look like a palm tree? And why is a sea lily called a "lily" when it is a marine animal and not a plant? Many marine animals bear a noticeable similarity in form to land-dwelling plants. And yet these marine animal forms evolved in the oceans first; land plants independently and convergently evolved similar forms much later in geologic time. In this book, George McGhee analyzes patterns of convergent evolution on Earth and argues that these patterns offer lessons for the search for life elsewhere in the universe. 
Our Earth is a water world; 71 percent of the earth's surface is covered by water. The fossil record shows that multicellular life on dry land is a new phenomenon; for the vast majority of the earth's history--3,500 million years of its 4,560 million years of existence--complex life existed only in the oceans. Explaining that convergent biological evolution occurs because of limited evolutionary pathways, McGhee examines examples of convergent evolution in forms of feeding, immobility and mobility, defense, and organ systems. McGhee suggests that the patterns of convergent evolution that we see in our own water world indicate the potential for similar convergent forms in other water worlds. We should search for extraterrestrial life on water worlds, and for technological life on water worlds with continental landmasses.

T1  - Gulf of Mexico Origin, Waters, and Biota:&nbsp;Volume 5, Chemical Oceanography
AN  - 2301953649
AB  - The fifth volume in the Harte Research Institute’s landmark scientific series on the Gulf of Mexico provides the first comprehensive study that covers the major core subjects of chemical oceanography in the Gulf. It synthesizes a tremendous amount of established research, together with the most recent information emerging from studies conducted during and after the Macondo Well oil spill that resulted from the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform. Situated within the boundaries of a changing semi-tropical region, the Gulf of Mexico is a particularly important body to its bordering countries—the United States, Mexico, and Cuba—and directly influences the economies of these nations through shipping, oil and gas extraction, mineral mining, fisheries, and myriad ecosystem services and recreational opportunities. The changing chemistry of the Gulf also has wide-ranging effects on weather patterns as many of the hurricanes that reach land in the US and Mexico pass through this ocean basin. We are already seeing some of the consequences of climate change, including, to name one example, the increased frequency of harmful algal blooms, the cause of which is still unknown in most cases. This book brings together a team of expert chemical oceanographers from the US and Mexico to provide a foundational understanding of the complex chemistry of North America’s only marginal sea. Gulf of Mexico Origin, Waters, and Biota: Volume 5, Chemical Oceanography serves as an important reference for understanding the basic science, management, and economic issues facing the Gulf of Mexico while pointing out key topics in critical need of additional research.

T1  - Handbook of Research on Environmental and Human Health Impacts of Plastic Pollution
AN  - 2268580455
AB  - Due to the non-biodegradability of plastic substances, coupled with poor waste management practices, plastic pollution has become a major environmental issue within the past decade. However, the negative effects of plastic pollution are rarely opposed, or the solutions proposed are costly or still damaging to the environment. New strategies must be undertaken to prevent irreparable environmental damage from disposable plastic products while maintaining and maximizing the benefits of plastics in specialized cases, such as medicine and public health. The Handbook of Research on Environmental and Human Health Impacts of Plastic Pollution is a collection of innovative research that assesses the negative impacts of plastic on the environment, human health, and ecosystems, and explores biotechnological approaches to solve plastic pollution. While highlighting topics including medical wastes, biodegradability, and phthalate exposure, this publication intends to provide readers with the latest solutions for reducing the burden of plastic on the environment. It is ideally designed for environmentalists, policymakers, instructors, researchers, graduate-level students, industrialists, and non-governmental organization professionals seeking current research on health and ecosystem concerns from the overconsumption of plastics.

T1  - The Hamptons of Toronto: Cottage-Condo Suburbanization and Implications for Public Space
AN  - 2290096811
AB  - Growth and development pressures in the City of Toronto and the surrounding region have led to the approval of a novel "cottage condo" development called Friday Harbour Resort. Marketed as the "Hamptons of Toronto," the resort's approval was contingent on a tenureship clause that restricts owners from occupying units for more than 300 days per year. As a public resort, the development introduces a significant amount of publicly accessible space to the town of Innisfil, where it is located. Through qualitative research, this article examines publicly accessible spaces at Friday Harbour Resort and contributes to the empirical research on public space in peripheries, highlighting potential social and spatial implications of this new "cottage-condo" trend in second home suburbanization.Alternate abstract:Les pressions exercées par la croissance et le développement dans la ville de Toronto et de la région environnante ont conduit a l'approbation d'un nouveau type de développement de ?cottage condo/ chalets-condos? appelé Friday Harbour Resort. Commercialisé sous le nom de ?Hamptons de Toronto?, l'approbation du développement immobilier dépendait d'une clause du bail qui interdit aux propriétaires d'occuper des unités plus de 300 jours par an. En tant que lieu de villégiature public, ce développement immobilier introduit un nombre important d'espaces accessibles au public au sein de la ville d'Innisfil, oü elle se trouve. Par le biais de recherches qualitatives, cet article examine les espaces accessibles au public du développement immobilier Friday Harbour Resort. L'article contribue également a la recherche empirique sur les espaces publics dans les périphéries, en soulignant les implications sociales et spatiales potentielles de cette nouvelle tendance en matiere résidence secondaire dans la banlieue.

T1  - Plankton:&nbsp;A Guide to Their Ecology and Monitoring for Water Quality
AN  - 2210142432
AB  - Healthy waterways and oceans are essential for our increasingly urbanised world. Yet monitoring water quality in aquatic environments is a challenge, as it varies from hour to hour due to stormwater and currents. Being at the base of the aquatic food web and present in huge numbers, plankton are strongly influenced by changes in environment and provide an indication of water quality integrated over days and weeks. Plankton are the aquatic version of a canary in a coal mine. They are also vital for our existence, providing not only food for fish, seabirds, seals and sharks, but producing oxygen, cycling nutrients, processing pollutants, and removing carbon dioxide from our atmosphere. 
This second edition of 
Plankton is a fully updated introduction to the biology, ecology and identification of plankton and their use in monitoring water quality. It includes expanded, illustrated descriptions of all major groups of freshwater, coastal and marine phytoplankton and zooplankton and a new chapter on teaching science using plankton. Best practice methods for plankton sampling and monitoring programs are presented using case studies, along with explanations of how to analyse and interpret sampling data. 

Plankton is an invaluable reference for teachers and students, environmental managers, ecologists, estuary and catchment management committees, and coastal engineers.

T1  - Potential ecotoxicological effects of antimicrobial surface coatings: a literature survey backed up by analysis of market reports
AN  - 2178517275
AB  - This review was initiated by the COST action CA15114 AMICI “Anti-Microbial Coating Innovations to prevent infectious diseases,” where one important aspect is to analyze ecotoxicological impacts of antimicrobial coatings (AMCs) to ensure their sustainable use. Scopus database was used to collect scientific literature on the types and uses of AMCs, while market reports were used to collect data on production volumes. Special attention was paid on data obtained for the release of the most prevalent ingredients of AMCs into the aqueous phase that was used as the proxy for their possible ecotoxicological effects. Based on the critical analysis of 2,720 papers, it can be concluded that silver-based AMCs are by far the most studied and used coatings followed by those based on titanium, copper, zinc, chitosan and quaternary ammonium compounds. The literature analysis pointed to biomedicine, followed by marine industry, construction industry (paints), food industry and textiles as the main fields of application of AMCs. The published data on ecotoxicological effects of AMCs was scarce, and also only a small number of the papers provided information on release of antimicrobial ingredients from AMCs. The available release data allowed to conclude that silver, copper and zinc are often released in substantial amounts (up to 100%) from the coatings to the aqueous environment. Chitosan and titanium were mostly not used as active released ingredients in AMCs, but rather as carriers for other release-based antimicrobial ingredients (e.g., conventional antibiotics). While minimizing the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections appeared to be the most prosperous field of AMCs application, the release of environmentally hazardous ingredients of AMCs into hospital wastewaters and thus, also the environmental risks associated with AMCs, comprise currently only a fraction of the release and risks of traditional disinfectants. However, being proactive, while the use of antimicrobial/antifouling coatings could currently pose ecotoxicological effects mainly in marine applications, the broad use of AMCs in other applications like medicine, food packaging and textiles should be postponed until reaching evidences on the (i) profound efficiency of these materials in controlling the spread of pathogenic microbes and (ii) safety of AMCs for the human and ecosystems.

T1  - Long-term fish assemblages of the Ohio River: altered trophic and life history strategies with hydrologic alterations and landuse modifications
AN  - 2170790289
AB  - Long-term monitoring of species assemblages provides a unique opportunity to test hypotheses regarding environmentally-induced directional trajectories of freshwater species assemblages. We used 57 years of lockchamber fish rotenone and boat electrofishing survey data (1957-2014) collected by the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation Commission (ORSANCO) to test for directional trajectories in taxonomy, trophic classifications, and life history strategies of freshwater fish assemblages in the Ohio River Basin. We found significant changes in taxonomic and trophic composition of freshwater fishes in the Ohio River Basin. Annual species richness varied from 31 to 90 species and generally increased with year. Temporal trajectories were present for taxonomic and trophic assemblages. Assemblage structure based on taxonomy was correlated with land use change (decrease in agriculture and increase in forest). Taxonomic assemblage structure was also correlated with altered hydrology variables of increased minimum discharge, decreased fall rate, and increased rise rate. Trophic composition of fish catch correlated with land use change (decrease in agriculture and increase in forest) and altered hydrology. Altered hydrology of increased minimum discharge, increased fall discharge, decreased base flows, and increased number of high pulse events was correlated with increased counts of herbivore-detritivores and decreased counts of piscivores and planktivores. We did not find directional changes in life history composition. We hypothesized a shift occurred from benthic to phytoplankton production throughout the basin that may have decreased secondary production of benthic invertebrates. This may also be responsible for lower trophic position of invertivore and piscivore fishes observed in other studies.

AN  - 2637299665
AB  - O desassoreamento de rios, geralmente, é resolvido através da dragagem dos sedimentos depositados em seu leito, utilizando diversas técnicas. Tratando de um caso concreto, objetiva-se expor a falta de critérios técnicos para a execução de tal intervenção, os impactos para o rio, biota aquática e a sua real necessidade. São apresentados aspectos da dissociação entre entendimentos consagrados na engenharia e seu descompasso com as teorias ecológicas. Este trabalho buscou estudar as enchentes urbanas, elucidando suas causas, para propor medidas e novas tecnologias para combatê-las, através de programas e políticas urbanas. A intenção é detalhar as causas das inundações urbanas, entendendo os fatores envolvidos e, com isso, discutir como o poder público deve proceder no que se refere ao desassoreamento. O principal objetivo desse trabalho é estimular a incorporação dos rios urbanos em estudos ecológicos e chamar a atenção do poder público para essa questão.Alternate abstract:

T1  - Production of Cyanotoxins by Microcystis aeruginosa Mediates Interactions with the Mixotrophic Flagellate Cryptomonas
AN  - 2550288489
AB  - Eutrophication of inland waters is expected to increase the frequency and severity of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Toxin-production associated with HABs has negative effects on human health and aquatic ecosystem functioning. Despite evidence that flagellates can ingest toxin-producing cyanobacteria, interactions between members of the microbial loop are underestimated in our understanding of the food web and algal bloom dynamics. Physical and allelopathic interactions between a mixotrophic flagellate (Cryptomonas sp.) and two strains of a cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa) were investigated in a full-factorial experiment in culture. The maximum population growth rate of the mixotroph (0.25 day−1) occurred during incubation with filtrate from toxic M. aeruginosa. Cryptomonas was able to ingest toxic and non-toxic M. aeruginosa at maximal rates of 0.5 and 0.3 cells day−1, respectively. The results establish that although Cryptomonas does not derive benefits from co-incubation with M. aeruginosa, it may obtain nutritional supplement from filtrate. We also provide evidence of a reduction in cyanotoxin concentration (microcystin-LR) when toxic M. aeruginosa is incubated with the mixotroph. Our work has implications for “trophic upgrading” within the microbial food web, where cyanobacterivory by nanoflagellates may improve food quality for higher trophic levels and detoxify secondary compounds.

T1  - Biomarker Effects in Carassius auratus Exposure to Ofloxacin, Sulfamethoxazole and Ibuprofen
AN  - 2329076458
AB  - Introduction Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) include thousands of chemicals, such as antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, blood lipid lowering agents, analgesics and β-blockers, detergents, and cosmetics [1].

Carassius auratus is a commonly used organism for toxicity assessments and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities in Carassius auratus are sensitive biomarkers for describing the toxic effects of pollutants on aquatic organisms [17,18,19].

Acetylthiocholine iodide (ATChI), β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2′-phosphate reduced tetrasodium salt (NADPH), 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitro-benzene (CDNB) and glutathione reductase (GR) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA).

The concentration of each chemical was analyzed using an Agilent 1260 UHPLC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) instrument equipped with a 6460QQQ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization.

T1  - Remote Sensing of Ice Phenology and Dynamics of Europe’s Largest Coastal Lagoon (The Curonian Lagoon)
AN  - 2304054161
AB  - A first-ever spatially detailed record of ice cover conditions in the Curonian Lagoon (CL), Europe’s largest coastal lagoon located in the southeastern Baltic Sea, is presented. The multi-mission synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements acquired in 2002–2017 by Envisat ASAR, RADARSAT-2, Sentinel-1 A/B, and supplemented by the cloud-free moderate imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, are used to document the ice cover properties in the CL. As shown, satellite observations reveal a better performance over in situ records in defining the key stages of ice formation and decay in the CL. Using advantages of both data sources, an updated ice season duration (ISD) record is obtained to adequately describe the ice cover season in the CL. High-resolution ISD maps provide important spatial details of ice growth and decay in the CL. As found, ice cover resides longest in the south-eastern CL and along the eastern coast, including the Nemunas Delta, while the shortest ice season is observed in the northern CL. During the melting season, the ice melt pattern is clearly shaped by the direction of prevailing winds, and ice drift velocities obtained from a limited number of observations range within 0.03–0.14 m/s. The pronounced shortening of the ice season duration in the CL is observed at a rate of 1.6–2.3 days year‒1 during 2002–2017, which is much higher than reported for the nearby Baltic Sea regions. While the timing of the freeze onset and full freezing has not changed much, the dates of the final melt onset and last observation of ice have a clear decreasing pattern toward an earlier ice break-up and complete melt-off due to an increase of air temperature strongly linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Notably, the correlation between the ISD, air temperature, and winter NAO index is substantially higher when considering the lagoon-averaged ISD values derived from satellite observations compared to those derived from coastal records. The latter clearly demonstrated the richness of the satellite observations that should definitely be exploited in regional ice monitoring programs.

T1  - Time lapse photography with two different camera systems for in situ observation of the bivalve Diplodon chilensis (Gray, 1828) in a southern Chilean lake
TT  - Fotografía en lapso de tiempo con dos sistemas de cámaras diferentes para la observación in situ del bivalvo Diplodon chilensis (Gray, 1828) en un lago del sur de Chile
AN  - 2293791943
AB  - We compared the validity of two low cost camera systems to analyze the filtration activity of Diplodon chilensis (Gray, 1828), the most common freshwater bivalve in southern Chile, by using time lapse photography. One camera system (Nikon D300) was connected with an external flash, whereas the other system (GoPro Hero 3+) contained a permanent video light source. Size change of the exhalant siphon area (ESA) of Diplodon individuals was used to track activity changes over time. The siphon of D. chilensis was completely closed for 3.4 % ± 5.2 % (mean ± SD) of the recording time and it shows a nearly completely opened siphon for 42.7 % ± 22.9 % of the recording time. The mean siphon opening was 68.3 % ± 26.5 % of its potential opening area. Although a red filter was placed in front of the video light source, the mobile fauna, especially Aegla abtao (Schmitt, 1942) and unidentified small fishes were highly attracted by the permanent light. We conclude that both low cost cameras are very suitable for in situ time lapse observation of freshwater clams since both deliver good image quality. However, special attention should be given to the light source since permanent light attracts animals including predators which might change filtration activity of D. chilensis.Alternate abstract:Comparamos la validez de dos sistemas de cámara de bajo costo para analizar la actividad de filtración de Diplodon chilensis (Gray, 1828), el bivalvo de agua dulce más común en el Sur de Chile, usando fotografía de lapso de tiempo. Un sistema de cámara (Nikon D300) se conectó con un flash externo, mientras que el otro sistema (GoPro Hero 3+) contenía una fuente de luz de vídeo permanente. El sifón de D. chilensis fue completamente cerrado por 3.4 % ± 5.2 % (media ± desviación estándar) del tiempo de grabación y muestra un sifón casi completamente abierto durante 42.7 % ± 22.9 % del tiempo de grabación. La apertura media del sifón fue de 68.3 % ± 26.5 % de su área de apertura potencial. Aunque un filtro rojo se colocó frente a la fuente de luz de vídeo, la fauna móvil, especialmente Aegla abtao (Schmitt, 1942) y los peces pequeños no identificados, fueron fuertemente atraídos por la luz permanente. Concluimos que ambas cámaras son adecuadas para la observación in situ de fotografía en lapso de tiempo de las almejas de agua dulce, ya que ambas ofrecen una buena calidad de imagen. Sin embargo, se debe prestar especial atención a la fuente de luz, ya que la luz permanente atrae a los animales, incluidos los depredadores, que podrían cambiar la actividad de filtración de D. chilensis.

T1  - Peripheral sensory neurons govern development of the nervous system in bivalve larvae
AN  - 2293519992
AB  - Recent findings regarding early lophotrochozoan development have altered the conventional model of neurogenesis and revealed that peripheral sensory elements play a key role in the initial organization of the larval nervous system. Here, we describe the main neurogenetic events in bivalve mollusks in comparison with other Lophotrochozoa, emphasizing a novel role for early neurons in establishing larval nervous systems and speculating about the morphogenetic function of the apical organ. We demonstrate that during bivalve development, peripheral sensory neurons utilizing various transmitters differentiate before the apical organ emerges. The first neurons and their neurites serve as a scaffold for the development of the nervous system. During veliger stage, cerebral, pleural, and visceral ganglia form along the lateral (visceral) nerve cords in anterior-to-posterior axis. The pedal ganglia and corresponding ventral (pedal) nerve cords develop much later, after larval settlement and metamorphosis. Pharmacological abolishment of the serotonin gradient within the larval body disrupts the navigation of “pioneer” axons resulting in malformation of the whole nervous system architecture. Comparative morphological data on neurogenetic events in bivalve mollusks shed new light on the origin of the nervous system, mechanisms of early axon navigation, and sequence of the tetraneurous nervous system formation. Furthermore, this information improves our understanding of the basic nervous system architecture in larval Bivalvia and Mollusca.

T1  - Triclosan: An Update on Biochemical and Molecular Mechanisms
AN  - 2223753926
AB  - Triclosan (TCS) is a synthetic, chlorinated phenolic antimicrobial agent commonly used in commercial and healthcare products. Items made with TCS include soaps, deodorants, shampoos, cosmetics, textiles, plastics, surgical sutures, and prosthetics. A wealth of information obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies has demonstrated the therapeutic effects of TCS, particularly against inflammatory skin conditions. Nevertheless, extensive investigations on the molecular aspects of TCS action have identified numerous adversaries associated with the disinfectant including oxidative injury and influence of physiological lifespan and longevity. This review presents a summary of the biochemical alterations pertaining to TCS exposure, with special emphasis on the diverse molecular pathways responsive to TCS that have been elucidated during the present decade.

T1  - Classification and characterization of hemocytes from two Asian horseshoe crab species Tachypleus tridentatus and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda
AN  - 2221826522
AB  - In present study, transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry were utilized to investigate the classification, characterization and immune functions of hemocytes from horseshoe crab, Tachypleus tridentatus and Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda. Three types of hemocytes were distinguished respectively: the granular cell, the semi-granular cell and the hyaline cell by transmission electron microscopy, while three hemocyte subpopulations (Gate 1 cell, Gate 2 cell, Gate 3 cell) were classified by flow cytometry. Hyaline cell was the major cell type with the highest nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and granular cell and semi-granular cell showed lower ratios. Immune parameters of hemocytes in horseshoe crabs were investigated by flow cytometry. Different hemocyte subpopulations respond for diverse functions. Lysosomal contents and hemocyte mortality in Gate 3 cell subpopulation were higher than that in other subpopulations, while reactive oxygen species, phagocytosis and non-specific esterase, in Gate 1 cell subpopulation, were higher than those in other subpopulations. The hemocyte types between the two species had no significant differences in staining or morphology.

T1  - Bioaccumulation and Biomagnification of 2-Ethylhexyl-4-dimethylaminobenzoate in Aquatic Animals
AN  - 2582821896
AB  - 2-Ethylhexyl-4-dimethylaminobenzoate (EHDAB) is a commonly used organic ultraviolet filter. The bioaccumulation and biomagnification of EHDAB were investigated in two aquatic animals, the larvae of midge (Chironomus riparius) and crucian carp (Carassius carassius), and the metabolic enzyme responses in fish liver were determined. EHDAB in the larvae of midge reached a steady state within 10 days of sediment exposure. The biota-sediment accumulation factors ranged from 0.10 to 0.54, and were inversely proportional to the exposure concentrations. The EHDAB-contaminated larvae were used to feed the crucian carp. Within 28 days of feeding exposure, the EHDAB levels in fish tissues gradually increased with the increase of the exposure concentration, exhibiting an apparent concentration-dependence and time-dependence. The liver and kidneys were the main organs of accumulation, and the biomagnification factors of EHDAB ranged from 8.97 to 11.0 and 6.44 to 10.8, respectively. In addition, EHDAB significantly increased the activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A, CYP3A and glutathione S-transferase in the fish liver. Our results indicate that EHDAB may pose a risk of biomagnification in an aquatic environment and influence the biological processes of exposed organisms.

AN  - 2121470733
AB  - The 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill coincided with the spawning season of many pelagic fish species in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet, few studies have investigated physiological responses of larval fish to interactions between anthropogenic crude oil exposure and natural factors (e.g. temperature, oxygen levels). Consequently, mahi mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) embryos were exposed for 24 hours to combinations of two temperatures (26 and 30°C) and six concentrations of oiled fractions of weathered oil (from 0 to 44.1 μg ∑50PAHs·L-1). In 56 hours post-fertilization larvae, heart rate, stroke volume and cardiac output were measured as indicators of functional cardiac phenotypes. Fluid accumulation and incidence of edema and hematomas were quantified as indicators of morphological impairments. At both 26 and 30°C, oil-exposed larvae suffered dose-dependent morphological impairments and functional heart failure. Elevation of temperature to 30°C appeared to induce greater physiological responses (bradycardia) at PAH concentrations in the range of 3.0–14.9 μg·L-1. Conversely, elevated temperature in oil-exposed larvae reduced edema severity and hematoma incidence. However, the apparent protective role of warmer temperature does not appear to protect against enhanced mortality. Collectively, our findings show that elevated temperature may slightly decrease larval resilience to concurrent oil exposure.

T1  - Rising profile on the use of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) for the removal of heavy metals from the environment: an overview
AN  - 2110278861
AB  - This review study is dealing with the recent advances and developments in the metal–organic framework (MOF) materials especially in the aspect of environmental remediation of heavy metals. Its application in some area of technological and mechanical advancement was also considered. The process of its synthesis and characterization was also put into consideration. Metal-organic frameworks can be said to be an exciting new class of nanoporous crystalline materials containing a metal as its central ion surrounded by organic ligands. An overwhelming characteristic of MOFs lies in its surface area which is amazingly large, exceeding those of known best activated carbons and zeolites. There is an increasingly high demand in the application of MOFs for a multitude of environmental uses or application to be used for capturing and separating various unwanted or even environmentally harmful chemicals, elements or materials. The advantage of MOFs over other known adsorbent materials, such as zeolites and carbon black, is that it possesses a far greater surface area along with amazingly great pore properties. In this review the synthesis and characterization of MOFs, the fate of heavy metals, the application of MOFs in heavy metals remediation and other means of heavy metals remediation are well discussed.

T1  - Relationship between Photosynthetic Capacity and Microcystin Production in Toxic Microcystis Aeruginosa under Different Iron Regimes
AN  - 2123867527
AB  - Blooms of harmful cyanobacteria have been observed in various water bodies across the world and some of them can produce intracellular toxins, such as microcystins (MCs), which negatively impact aquatic organisms and human health. Iron participates significantly in cyanobacterial photosynthesis and is proposed to be linked to MC production. Here, the cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa was cultivated under different iron regimes to investigate the relationship between photosynthetic capacity and MC production. The results showed that iron addition increased cell density, cellular protein concentration and the Chl-a (chlorophyll-a) content. Similarly, it can also up–regulate photosynthetic capacity and promote MC–leucine–arginine (MC–LR) production, but not in a dose–dependent manner. Moreover, a significant positive correlation between photosynthetic capacity and MC production was observed, and electron transport parameters were the most important parameters contributing to the variation of intracellular MC–LR concentration revealed by Generalized Additive Model analysis. As the electron transport chain was affected by iron variation, adenosine triphosphate production was inhibited, leading to the alteration of MC synthetase gene expression. Therefore, it is demonstrated that MC production greatly relies on redox status and energy metabolism of photosynthesis in M. aeruginosa. In consequence, more attention should be paid to the involvement of photosynthesis in the regulation of MC production by iron variation in the future.

T1  - Characterization of Temporal and Spatial Variability of Phosphorus Loading to Lake Erie from the Western Basin Using Wavelet Transform Methods
AN  - 2120770339
AB  - The characterization of temporal and spatial patterns in phosphorus (P) loading in Lake Erie is essential in order to continue monitoring the excessive P condition that comes from the western Lake Erie Basin. This study aims to perform such a characterization using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) methods. These wavelet transformations were conducted on streamflow data, TP loads, and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) of six stations located near Lake Erie of Northern Ohio. These stations are located near the outlet of Cuyahoga, Grand, Maumee, Vermilion, Raisin, and Sandusky watersheds. Long-term continuous P loading data, in which some dated back to 1970, were used in the analysis. The results obtained from the CWT and DWT approaches were found to complement each other. Streamflow had significant mixed variability at 1, 2, and 4 years. The variability for SRP was limited to 1 and 2 years while the TP variability was only seen at the 1-year scale. It was interesting to find that strong temporal patterns of SRP were observed in most of the watersheds only after the mid-1990s. The CWT wavelet spectra also reflected the land use characteristics of each watershed. For example, the wavelet spectra of surface runoff and TP for the agricultural watersheds (i.e., Raisin, Sandusky, and Maumee Rivers) were similar and characterized by significant variability primarily at the annual scale and at the two to four-year periodicities. The urbanized watershed (i.e., Cuyahoga River) did not show any association between either phosphorus (TP or SRP) with surface runoff and baseflow, which indicates that P in the urbanized watershed was not driven by the flow.

T1  - Waterbird counts on large water bodies: comparing ground and aerial methods during different ice conditions
AN  - 2071090992
AB  - The aerial and ground methods of counting birds in a coastal area during different ice conditions were compared. Ice coverage of water was an important factor affecting the results of the two methods. When the water was ice-free, more birds were counted from the ground, whereas during ice conditions, higher numbers were obtained from the air. The first group of waterbirds with the smallest difference between the two methods (average 6%) contained seven species: Mute Swan Cygnus olor, Whooper Swan Cygnus cygnus, Greater Scaup Aythya marila, Tufted Duck Aythya fuligula, Common Goldeneye Bucephala clangula, Smew Mergellus albellus and Goosander Mergus merganser; these were treated as the core group. The second group with a moderate difference (average 20%) included another six species: Mallard Anas platyrhynchos, Eurasian Wigeon Mareca penelope, Common Pochard Aythya ferina, Great Crested Grebe Podiceps cristatus and Eurasian Coot Fulica atra. The third group with a large difference (average 85%) included five species, all of the Anatini tribe: Gadwall Mareca strepera, Northern Pintail Anas acuta, Northern Shoveler Spatula clypeata, Eurasian Teal Anas crecca and Garganey Spatula querquedula. During ice conditions, smaller numbers of most species were counted from the ground. The exception here was Mallard, more of which were counted from the ground, but the difference between two methods was relatively small in this species (7.5%). Under ice-free conditions, both methods can be used interchangeably for the most numerous birds occupying open water (core group) without any significant impact on the results. When water areas are frozen over, air counts are preferable as the results are more reliable. The cost analysis shows that a survey carried out by volunteer observers (reimbursement of travel expenses only) from the land is 58% cheaper, but if the observers are paid, then an aerial survey is 40% more economical.

T1  - Spatial changes in zooplankton communities in a strong human-mediated river ecosystem
AN  - 2063605155
AB  - River damming causes a decrease in water current velocity which leads to an increase in richness and abundance of organisms atypical for running waters. Zooplankton is a representative example of such organisms. The influx of zooplankton from carp ponds is an additional factor that increases richness and abundance of zooplankton in rivers. We hypothesized that zooplankton dispersing from the carp ponds colonize the impoundments in river and the richness of zooplankton increase in impoundments by development of new species, not observed in the upstream. The zooplankton was collected monthly from April to September of 2013 and 2014. Sampling sites were located in the Barycz river (in the lotic sections and in the dam impoundments), as well as in its tributaries, which are the outlets of carp ponds. The most changes in zooplankton richness and abundance were observed at sites located within the dam impoundments, especially in relation to the lower values of the current velocity. Since the abundance of pelagic rotifers, cladocerans and copepods in the carp pond outlets was similar to that at lower sites in the Barycz, the influence of the carp pond outlets on the abundance in the dam and lotic sections was significant. The river itself in its impounded sections provides advantageous conditions for retention and colonization by a high abundance of zooplankton dispersing from the carp ponds, and for the development of species not occurred in the upstream, which, in turn, increases richness.

AB  - The capacity to sense environmental nutrient availability and accordingly modulate growth, energy consumption, and biomass production is critical for competitive fitness and adaptation of unicellular organisms.

Reviews in this issue discuss effects of nutritional status on the immune system (Shondelmyer et al. ), mucosal-associated microbiomes (Ricke, Chen et al. , Mukherjee et al. ), behavior and the nervous system (Chen et al. ), and cancers and other non-communicable pathologies (Donovan et al. , Teixeira et al. ) implicating diet as a critical mediator of overall homeostasis in the body through regulation of the various systems that comprise it.

[...]we see increased incidence of metabolic-related diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular and autoinflammatory diseases, diabetes, and liver disease.

T1  - Effect of dietary Sargassum wightii and its fucoidan-rich extract on growth, immunity, disease resistance and antimicrobial peptide gene expression in Labeo rohita
AN  - 2623489693
AB  - This work aimed to appraise growth performance, immune responsiveness, bacterial disease resistance and mRNA expression of two antimicrobial peptides in Labeo rohita fingerlings fed diets supplemented with seaweed Sargassum wightii and its fucoidan-rich extract. Two hundred and twenty-five fingerlings were divided into five experimental groups in triplicates, each replicate having 15 fish in a 90-L tank. Different groups were fed with isonitrogenous (35% crude protein) and isoenergetic (1408.16 kJ/100 g) diets containing either 0% fucoidan-rich seaweed extract (FRSE), 1% FRSE, 2% FRSE, 3% seaweed powder and 6% seaweed powder for 60 days. Partial nucleotide sequences of the antimicrobial peptides, hepcidin and defensin, were characterized in Labeo rohita fingerlings, and gene expression in the different tissues of experimental fish was studied. The fish-fed FRSE-supplemented diets showed significant increase (P < 0.05) in the mRNA expression of antimicrobial peptides in liver, skin and intestine tissues. Bacterial challenge study using Aeromonas hydrophila showed higher survival in the FRSE-fed groups. Fish-fed FRSE-supplemented diets also showed better non-specific immune response (NBT reduction, serum lysozyme activity, serum albumin: globulin ratio and phagocytic activity) in pre-challenge and post-challenge periods. No significant difference was observed in the growth performance in the different experimental groups. The study indicates that although dietary FRSE is a potential immunostimulant in Labeo rohita fingerlings, it does not improve growth performance.

T1  - Population genetic signatures of a climate change driven marine range extension
AN  - 2058243252
AB  - Shifts in species distribution, or ‘range shifts’, are one of the most commonly documented responses to ocean warming, with important consequences for the function and structure of ecosystems, and for socio-economic activities. Understanding the genetic signatures of range shifts can help build our knowledge of the capacity of species to establish and persist in colonised areas. Here, seven microsatellite loci were used to examine the population connectivity, genetic structure and diversity of Octopus tetricus, which has extended its distribution several hundred kilometres polewards associated with the southwards extension of the warm East Australian Current along south-eastern Australia. The historical distribution and the range extension zones had significant genetic differences but levels of genetic diversity were comparable. The population in the range extension zone was sub-structured, contained relatively high levels of self-recruitment and was sourced by migrants from along the entire geographic distribution. Genetic bottlenecks and changes in population size were detected throughout the range extension axis. Persistent gene flow from throughout the historical zone and moderate genetic diversity may buffer the genetic bottlenecks and favour the range extension of O. tetricus. These characteristics may aid adaptation, establishment, and long-term persistence of the population in the range extension zone.

AB  - This work aimed to appraise growth performance, immune responsiveness, bacterial disease resistance and mRNA expression of two antimicrobial peptides in Labeo rohita fingerlings fed diets supplemented with seaweed Sargassum wightii and its fucoidan-rich extract. Two hundred and twenty-five fingerlings were divided into five experimental groups in triplicates, each replicate having 15 fish in a 90-L tank. Different groups were fed with isonitrogenous (35% crude protein) and isoenergetic (1408.16 kJ/100 g) diets containing either 0% fucoidan-rich seaweed extract (FRSE), 1% FRSE, 2% FRSE, 3% seaweed powder and 6% seaweed powder for 60 days. Partial nucleotide sequences of the antimicrobial peptides, hepcidin and defensin, were characterized in Labeo rohita fingerlings, and gene expression in the different tissues of experimental fish was studied. The fish-fed FRSE-supplemented diets showed significant increase (P < 0.05) in the mRNA expression of antimicrobial peptides in liver, skin and intestine tissues. Bacterial challenge study using Aeromonas hydrophila showed higher survival in the FRSE-fed groups. Fish-fed FRSE-supplemented diets also showed better non-specific immune response (NBT reduction, serum lysozyme activity, serum albumin: globulin ratio and phagocytic activity) in pre-challenge and post-challenge periods. No significant difference was observed in the growth performance in the different experimental groups. The study indicates that although dietary FRSE is a potential immunostimulant in Labeo rohita fingerlings, it does not improve growth performance.

T1  - Metabolic responses to elevated pCO2 in the gills of the Pacific Oyster (Magallana gigas) using a GC-TOF-MS-based metabolomics approach
AN  - 2026825715
AB  - Rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), primarily from human fossil fuel combustion and cement production, are resulting in increasing absorption of CO2 by the oceans, which has led to a decline in ocean pH in a process known as ocean acidification (OA). There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the potential effect of OA on life-history traits of marine organisms. Consequently, gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) based metabolic profiling approach was applied to examine the metabolic responses of Magallana gigas to elevated pCO2 levels, under otherwise natural field conditions. CO2. Oysters were exposed natural environmental pCO2 (~625.40 μatm) and elevated pCO2 (~1432.94 μatm) levels for 30 days. Results indicated that 36 differential metabolites with variable importance in the projection (VIP) value greater than 1 and Student's t-test lower than 0.05 were identified. Differential metabolites were mapped in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database to search for the related metabolic pathways. Pathway enrichment analysis indicates that alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and glycine, serine and threonine metabolism were the most statistically enriched pathways. Further analysis suggested that elevated pCO2 disturb the TCA cycle via succinate accumulation and Magallana gigas most likely adjust their energy metabolic via alanine and GABA accumulation accordingly to cope with elevated pCO2. These findings provide an understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in modulating metabolism under elevated pCO2 levels associated with predicted OA.

T1  - Waterbird counts on large water bodies: comparing ground and aerial methods during different ice conditions
AN  - 2015245501
AB  - The paper compares the aerial and ground methods of counting birds in a coastal area during different ice conditions. Ice coverage of waters was the most important factor affecting the results of the two methods. When the water was ice-free, more birds were counted from the ground, whereas during ice conditions, higher numbers were obtained from the air. In ice-free conditions the group of waterbirds with the smallest difference between the two methods (< 6%) contained six species: Greater Scaup, Smew, Mute Swan, Goosander, Common Goldeneye and Tufted Duck; the group with a moderate difference (15%-45%) included another six species: Eurasian Coot, Whooper Swan, Mallard, Eurasian Wigeon, Great Crested Grebe and Common Pochard; while the group with a large difference (> 68%) included five species, all of the genus Anas: Gadwall, Eurasian Teal, Northern Shoveler, Northern Pintail and Garganey. In ice conditions, smaller numbers of most species were counted from the ground, except for Mallard, where the difference between two methods was small (7.5%). Under ice-free conditions, both methods can be used interchangeably for the most numerous birds occupying open water without any great impact on the results. When water areas are frozen over, air counts are preferable as the results are more accurate. The cost analysis shows that a survey carried out by volunteer observers (reimbursement of travel expenses only) from the land is 58% cheaper, but if the observers are paid, then the aerial survey is 40% more economical.

T1  - Accumulation of Dinophysis Toxins in Bivalve Molluscs
AN  - 2582920788
AB  - Several species of the dinoflagellate genus Dinophysis produce toxins that accumulate in bivalves when they feed on populations of these organisms. The accumulated toxins can lead to intoxication in consumers of the affected bivalves. The risk of intoxication depends on the amount and toxic power of accumulated toxins. In this review, current knowledge on the main processes involved in toxin accumulation were compiled, including the mechanisms and regulation of toxin acquisition, digestion, biotransformation, compartmentalization, and toxin depuration. Finally, accumulation kinetics, some models to describe it, and some implications were also considered.

T1  - Size dependence of offspring production in isopods: a synthesis
AN  - 2170331090
AB  - In isopods, parental care takes the form of offspring brooding in marsupial pouches. Marsupial brooding was an important step towards the origin of terrestrial lifestyles among isopods, but its potential role in shaping isopod life histories remains unknown. It is here considered that marsupial brooding imposes costs and creates a temporary association between the survival of mothers and that of their offspring. Integrating findings from different life history models, we predicted that the effects of marsupial brooding set selective conditions for the continuation of growth after maturation, which leads to indeterminate growth, and the production of larger offspring by larger females. Based on this perspective, a study on the size dependence of offspring production in the woodlouse  Porcellio scaber  was performed and the generality of the results was tested by reviewing the literature on offspring production in other isopods. In  P. scaber  and almost all the other studied isopods, clutch size is positively related to female size. Such dependence is a necessary pre-condition for the evolution of indeterminate growth. The body mass of  P. scaber  differed six-fold between the largest and smallest brooding females, indicating a high potential for post-maturation growth. Our review showed that offspring size is a rarely studied trait in isopods and that it correlates negatively with offspring number but positively with female size in nearly half of the studied species. Our study of  P. scaber  revealed similar patterns, but the positive effect of female size on offspring size occurred only in smaller broods, and the negative relation between clutch size and offspring size occurred only in larger females. We conclude that the intraspecific patterns of offspring production in isopods agree with theoretical predictions regarding the role of offspring brooding in shaping the adaptive patterns of female investment in growth, reproduction, and the parental care provided to individual offspring.

T1  - Occurrence of β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) and Isomers in Aquatic Environments and Aquatic Food Sources for Humans
AN  - 2014700657
AB  - The neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA), a non-protein amino acid produced by terrestrial and aquatic cyanobacteria and by micro-algae, has been suggested to play a role as an environmental factor in the neurodegenerative disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis-Parkinsonism-Dementia complex (ALS-PDC). The ubiquitous presence of BMAA in aquatic environments and organisms along the food chain potentially makes it public health concerns. However, the BMAA-associated human health risk remains difficult to rigorously assess due to analytical challenges associated with the detection and quantification of BMAA and its natural isomers, 2,4-diamino butyric acid (DAB), β-amino-N-methyl-alanine (BAMA) and N-(2-aminoethyl) glycine (AEG). This systematic review, reporting the current knowledge on the presence of BMAA and isomers in aquatic environments and human food sources, was based on a selection and a score numbering of the scientific literature according to various qualitative and quantitative criteria concerning the chemical analytical methods used. Results from the best-graded studies show that marine bivalves are to date the matrix containing the higher amount of BMAA, far more than most fish muscles, but with an exception for shark cartilage. This review discusses the available data in terms of their use for human health risk assessment and identifies knowledge gaps requiring further investigations.

T1  - Freshwater Ecosystems in Protected Areas:&nbsp;Conservation and Management
AN  - 2148504606
AB  - Freshwater ecosystems have the greatest species diversity per unit area and many endangered species. This book shows that, rather than being a marginal part of terrestrial protected area management, freshwater conservation is central to sustaining biodiversity. It focuses on better practices for conserving inland aquatic ecosystems in protected areas, including rivers, wetlands, peatlands, other freshwater and brackish ecosystems, and estuaries. The authors define inland aquatic ecosystems, showing just how diverse and widespread they are. They examine the principles and processes that are essential for the conservation of freshwater ecosystems and aquatic species. Major categories of threats to freshwater ecosystems and the flow-on implications for protected area design are described. Practical case studies are used to illustrate principles and practices applied around the world. Specific management needs of the main types of freshwater ecosystems are considered, as well as the management of freshwaters in the broader landscape, showing how natural resource governance processes can be harnessed to better manage freshwater biodiversity. The book offers commentary on how to adapt freshwater conservation practices to climate change and ends with an insightful synthesis.

T1  - Relationships among cyanobacteria, zooplankton and fish in sub-bloom conditions in the Sulejow Reservoir
AN  - 2417819978
AB  - The occurrence of cyanobacteria is particularly characteristic of shallow eutrophic waters, and they often form massive ‘blooms’ that can affect aquatic invertebrates and fish. However, even a low abundance of cyanobacteria can be hazardous to aquatic organisms, due to the production of toxic metabolites. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cyanobacteria and their toxicity (biological activity) towards zooplankton and fish communities, when only low concentrations of cyanobacterial chlorophyll a (less than 20 μg L-1) are detected, i.e. in sub-bloom conditions. Measurements were performed in Sulejow Reservoir (Central Poland), a shallow, lowland, eutrophic reservoir, in which cyanobacterial blooms occur regularly. Fish were assessed using echo-sounding (distribution) and by gillnetting (species composition). Simultaneously, zooplankton, cyanobacteria and physico-chemical characteristics were studied at 14 stations situated along hydroacoustic transects. Parameters that characterized the cyanobacteria (cyanobacterial chlorophyll a concentration, the number of 16S rRNA and the mcyA gene copies and microcystin (MC) concentration) were consistently correlated (based on a principal component analysis), and the highest values were found in the downstream region of the study area. This ‘cyano-complex’ was also positively correlated with oxygen concentration, pH and phosphate levels, but was negatively correlated with temperature and the concentrations of nitrates and nitrites. In Sulejow Reservoir in 2013 the biomass of large zooplankton filter feeders decreased along with increasing MC concentration and fish densities, while small filter feeders did not present such relationships with regards to fish densities. Fish abundance tended to decrease at stations with a lower abundance of cyanobacteria and with growing toxic genotype copies and MC concentration.

T1  - La Biodiversité : Avec Ou Sans L'homme ?:&nbsp;Réflexions d'un écologue Sur la Protection de la Nature en France
AN  - 2148418449
AB  - Cet ouvrage en impression à la demande sera envoyé sous 3 semaines environ (France métropolitaine) et dans un colis séparé en cas de commande avec un autre livre papier. 
Notre territoire a connu une histoire climatologique contrastée, où se sont alternées extinctions d'espèces et périodes de reconstruction. Ce que nous appelons « nature », en France, est en réalité le produit des activités humaines et de processus écologiques spontanés depuis des milliers d'années. 
La déforestation, l'agriculture, les aménagements des cours d'eau et des zones humides, les introductions d'espèces ont créé des milieux artificialisés, gérés pour des usages variés. L'homme n'a pas détruit la diversité biologique en métropole, mais il l'a transformée et enrichie. À partir de cette affirmation, l'auteur pose la question du pilotage des dynamiques de cette nature, soumise à de nouvelles pratiques agricoles, à l'urbanisation, au réchauffement climatique. Quels compromis sont possibles pour contrôler les facteurs qui nuisent à nos activités et à notre cadre de vie (ravageurs de cultures, vecteurs de maladies...), tout en préservant un riche patrimoine d'espèces et de paysages auquel nous sommes attachés ? 
Dans ce contexte, qu'entend-on par « érosion de la biodiversité » ? Quand on modifie un système écologique, on perd des espèces, mais on peut en favoriser d'autres. Pour construire une gestion future de la biodiversité compréhensible par tous, il faut sortir du « prêt-à-penser » catastrophiste et tenir compte aussi des succès dans nos relations avec la nature.

T1  - High throughput sequencing of RNA transcriptomes in Ruditapes philippinarum identifies genes involved in osmotic stress response
AN  - 1956115349
AB  - Ruditapes philippinarum, is an economically important marine bivalve species. The ability to cope with low salinity stress is quite important for the survival of aquatic species under natural conditions. In this study, the transcriptional response of the Manila clam to low salinity stress was characterized using RNA sequencing. The transcriptomes of a low salinity-treatment group (FRp1, FRp2), which survived under low salinity stress, and control group (SRp1, SRp2), which was not subjected to low salinity stress, were sequenced with the Illumina HiSeq platform. A total of 196,578 unigenes were generated. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that signal transduction, immune response, cellular component organization or biogenesis, and energy production processes were the most highly enriched pathways among the genes that were differentially expressed under low salinity stress. All these pathways could be assigned to the following biological functions in the low salinity tolerant Manila clam: signal response to low salinity stress, antioxidant response, intracellular free amino acid transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, cell signaling pathways, and regulation of ionic content and cell volume. In summary, this is the first study using high-throughput sequencing to identify gene targets that could explain osmotic regulation mechanisms under salinity stress in R. philippinarum.

T1  - Sublethal effects of copper nanoparticles on the histology of gill, liver and kidney of the Caspian roach, Rutilus rutilus caspicus
AN  - 1939709464
AB  - The current study has determined the toxicity effects of copper nanoparticles on the some vital organs such as gill, liver and kidney of Caspian Roach; Rutillus rutillus caspicus. For this purpose, 120 fishes were used as experimental samples and exposed to 0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg/L of Cu nanoparticles for 21 days, and 30 fishes assumed as the experiment control. The mean water temperature of the aquaria was 22±2 °C, dissolved oxygen 5.2 mg/L, pH at 7±0.004 and the concentration of calcium carbonate was 270 ppm. On 7, 14 and 21 days after exposing the fishes to copper nanoparticles, three fishes were randomly selected from each aquaria, sacrificed and samples from their gill, liver and kidney were taken and fixed in cold 10 % buffered formalin. Then microscopic sections were prepared and examined by light microscope which showed histological alternations in the gill, liver and kidney tissues. Evaluation of these changes could be useful in estimating the harmful effects of copper nanoparticles. Histological alternation in gills included: hyperplasia, fusion and detachment of secondary lamellae, blood congestion in vascular axis of primary filaments, reduced secondary lamellae length and cellular degeneration. Histological changes in liver included blood congestion in the central veins, cytoplasmic vacuolation of the hepatocytes, cellular degeneration and congestion in the blood sinusoids and necrosis of the hepatocytes. Histological changes in kidneys included glomerular shrinkage, severe degeneration in the tubules cells, interstitial tissue and glomerulus, increase in interstitial tissue cells and macrophages aggregation. The degree of damages was more intensive at higher copper nanoparticles concentrations. The result of the study showed that copper nanoparticles could cause severe damages in the vital tissues of Caspian roach; Rutillus rutillus caspicus and have lethal effects for fish.

T1  - Ecotoxicology and Genotoxicology:&nbsp;Non-Traditional Terrestrial Models
AN  - 2148415092
AB  - The potential impact of anthropogenic pollutants such as agrochemicals on the environment is of global concern. Increasing use of certain compounds can result in contamination of food, water and atmospheric systems and in order to combat this pollution it is important to be able to accurately monitor the short and long term effects.
 This book describes the latest non-traditional terrestrial species models used as indicators of the toxic effects of environmental pollutants. The book enables understanding of the effects of pollutants in non-target species, and therefore enables analysis of the effects on ecosystems.
 This book will be of interest to anyone interested in developing new biomarker species with high degrees of ecological relevance. It will serve as a useful resource for regulatory and research toxicologists, particularly those interested in soil screening and the effects of pollutants on wildlife and insects and their use as biological indicators.

T1  - Fixed-Nitrogen Loss Associated with Sinking Zooplankton Carcasses in a Coastal Oxygen Minimum Zone (Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica)
AN  - 2307723737
AB  - Oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) in the ocean are of key importance for pelagic fixed-nitrogen loss (N-loss) through microbial denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Recent studies document that zooplankton is surprisingly abundant in and around OMZs and that the microbial community associated with carcasses of a large copepod species mediates denitrification. Here, we investigate the complex N-cycling associated with sinking zooplankton carcasses exposed to the steep O2 gradient in a coastal OMZ (Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica). 15N-stable-isotope enrichment experiments revealed that the carcasses of abundant copepods and ostracods provide anoxic microbial hotspots in the pelagic zone by hosting intense anaerobic N-cycle activities even in the presence of ambient O2. Carcass-associated anaerobic N-cycling was clearly dominated by dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) at up to 30.8 nmol NH4+ individual-1 d-1, followed by denitrification (up to 10.8 nmol N2-N individual-1 d-1), anammox (up to 1.6 nmol N2-N individual-1 d-1), and N2O production (up to 1.2 nmol N2O-N individual-1 d-1). In contrast, anaerobic N-cycling mediated by free-living bacteria proceeded mainly through anammox and denitrification in the anoxic bottom water, which underpins the distinctive microbial metabolism associated with zooplankton carcasses. Pelagic N-loss is potentially enhanced by zooplankton carcasses both directly through N2 and N2O production, and indirectly through NH4+ production that may fuel free-living anammox bacteria. We estimate that in the hypoxic water layer of Golfo Dulce, carcass-associated N2 and N2O production enhance N-loss as much as 1.4-fold at a relative carcass abundance of 36%. In the anoxic bottom water, however, N-loss is likely enhanced only marginally due to high ambient rates and low zooplankton abundance. Thus, zooplankton carcasses may enhance N-loss mainly at the hypoxic boundaries of OMZs which are usually more extensive in open-ocean than in coastal settings. Notably, these contributions by zooplankton carcasses to pelagic N-loss remain undetected by conventional, incubation-based rate measurements.

T1  - Whole genome analysis of a schistosomiasis-transmitting freshwater snail
AN  - 1899041443
AB  - Biomphalaria snails are instrumental in transmission of the human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni. With the World Health Organization's goal to eliminate schistosomiasis as a global health problem by 2025, there is now renewed emphasis on snail control. Here, we characterize the genome of Biomphalaria glabrata, a lophotrochozoan protostome, and provide timely and important information on snail biology. We describe aspects of phero-perception, stress responses, immune function and regulation of gene expression that support the persistence of B. glabrata in the field and may define this species as a suitable snail host for S. mansoni. We identify several potential targets for developing novel control measures aimed at reducing snail-mediated transmission of schistosomiasis.

T1  - Archaeology of the Everglades
AN  - 2134757115
AB  - "An important book about a natural World Heritage site that also has a rich human heritage."--American Archaeology"As the only available synthesis of the archaeology of the Everglades, this book fills an important niche."--Choice"Adds immeasurably to our knowledge of South Florida archaeology."--Journal of Field Archaeology"Offers a vivid glimpse into a rich cultural past in an oftentimes misunderstood and overlooked region of our country."--H-Net "Detailed descriptions of archaeological surveys and test excavations dovetail nicely with broader chapters on settlement, subsistence, and social organization. This is a valuable reference work."--SMRC Revista"An extremely important work. . . . John has brought his unprecedented knowledge of the archaeology together with his anthropological and ecological insights, to provide the most thorough synthesis of the predrainage aboriginal use of this area. Now that Congress has mandated the restoration of the Everglades . . . this book will provide researchers as well as the general public with an understanding of what the Everglades were like prior to drainage and how humans utilized this natural wonder."--Randolph J. Widmer, University of Houston Originally prepared as a report for the National Park Service in 1988, Griffin's work places the human occupation of the Everglades within the context of South Florida's unique natural environmental systems. He documents, for the first time, the little known but relatively extensive precolumbian occupation of the interior portion of the region and surveys the material culture of the Glades area. He also provides an account of the evolution of the region's climate and landscape and a history of previous archaeological research in the area and fuses ecological and material evidence into a discussion of the sequence and distribution of cultures, social organization, and lifeways of the Everglades inhabitants. Milanich and Miller have transformed Griffin's report into an accessible, comprehensive overview of Everglades archaeology for specialists and the general public. Management plans have been removed, maps redrawn, and updates added. The result is a synthesis of the archaeology of a region that is taking center stage as various state and federal agencies cooperate to restore the health of this important ecosystem, one of the nation's most renowned natural areas and one that has been designated a World Heritage Site and a Wetland of International Importance. This book will make a key work in Florida archaeology more readily available as a springboard for future research and will also, at last, allow John Griffin's contribution to south Florida archaeology to be more widely appreciated.John W. Griffin, a pioneer in Florida archaeology, was an archaeologist for both the Florida Park Service and the National Park Service (NPS), director of the NPS Southeast Archeological Center in Macon, Georgia, and director of the St. Augustine Preservation Board. Jerald T. Milanich is emeritus professor at the University of Florida/Florida Museum of Natural History and author of numerous books about the native peoples of the Southeast United States. James J. Miller was state archaeologist and chief of Florida's Bureau of Archaeological Research for twenty years and is now a consultant in heritage planning.

T1  - Marine Ornamental Species Aquaculture
AN  - 2130883032
AB  - MARINE ORNAMENTAL SPECIES AQUACULTURE 
The global trade of aquatic organisms for home and public aquariums, along with associated equipment and accessories, has become a multi-billion dollar industry. Aquaculture of marine ornamental species, still in its infancy, is recognized as a viable alternative to wild collection as it can supplement or replace the supply of wild-caught specimens and potentially help recover natural populations through restocking. 
This book collects into a single work the most up-to-date information currently available on the aquaculture of marine ornamental species. It includes the contributions of more than 50 leading scientists and experts on different topics relevant for the aquaculture of the most emblematic groups of organisms traded for reef aquariums. From clownfish, to angelfish, tangs and seahorses, as well as corals, anemones, shrimps, giant clams and several other reef organisms, all issues related with the husbandry, breeding, and trade are addressed, with explanatory schemes and illustrations being used to help in understanding the most complex topics addressed. 

Marine Ornamental Species Aquaculture is a key reference for scientists and academics in research institutes and universities, public and private aquaria, as well as for hobbyists. Entrepreneurs will also find this book an important resource, as the culture of marine ornamental species is analyzed from a business oriented perspective, highlighting the risks and opportunities of commercial scale aquaculture of marine ornamentals.

T1  - Sherbrooke Lake access point adds to controversy
AN  - 1867984604
AB  - The municipal districts of Lunenburg and Chester recently agreed to move forward with a memorandum of understanding laying out a plan for providing access for anglers and boaters who don't live on the lake.

 "A decision was made by MODL to acquire land on Sherbrooke Lake to provide for public access/use.

 "MODC is both surprised and discouraged that MODL purchased land in our municipality to provide public access to Sherbrooke Lake without discussing the same with us first."

The deal commits to public access for all, despite concerns from cottage owners about pollution, garbage and safety if boat traffic increases.

In a November 2013 letter, Coolican said access would allow "impacts on water quality, noise, garbage, the importation of invasive organisms such as zebra mussels, security, the protection of privately owned beaches, and boating accidents on the water."

[...]it also showed many, particularly lake property owners, were concerned "about the risk of disturbance, theft, littering, or vandalism if a public space is opened on Sherbrooke Lake."

T1  - Population control methods in stochastic extinction and outbreak scenarios
AN  - 1864404954
AB  - Adaptive limiter control (ALC) and adaptive threshold harvesting (ATH) are two related control methods that have been shown to stabilize fluctuating populations. Large variations in population abundance can threaten the constancy and the persistence stability of ecological populations, which may impede the success and efficiency of managing natural resources. Here, we consider population models that include biological mechanisms characteristic for causing extinctions on the one hand and pest outbreaks on the other hand. These models include Allee effects and the impact of natural enemies (as is typical of forest defoliating insects). We study the impacts of noise and different levels of biological parameters in three extinction and two outbreak scenarios. Our results show that ALC and ATH have an effect on extinction and outbreak risks only for sufficiently large control intensities. Moreover, there is a clear disparity between the two control methods: in the extinction scenarios, ALC can be effective and ATH can be counterproductive, whereas in the outbreak scenarios the situation is reversed, with ATH being effective and ALC being potentially counterproductive.

T1  - Antibacterial properties and toxicity from metallic nanomaterials
AN  - 2239158558
AB  - The era of antibiotic resistance is a cause of increasing concern as bacteria continue to develop adaptive countermeasures against current antibiotics at an alarming rate. In recent years, studies have reported nanoparticles as a promising alternative to antibacterial reagents because of their exhibited antibacterial activity in several biomedical applications, including drug and gene delivery, tissue engineering, and imaging. Moreover, nanomaterial research has led to reports of a possible relationship between the morphological characteristics of a nanomaterial and the magnitude of its delivered toxicity. However, conventional synthesis of nanoparticles requires harsh chemicals and costly energy consumption. Additionally, the exact relationship between toxicity and morphology of nanomaterials has not been well established. Here, we review the recent advancements in synthesis techniques for silver, gold, copper, titanium, zinc oxide, and magnesium oxide nanomaterials and composites, with a focus on the toxicity exhibited by nanomaterials of multidimensions. This article highlights the benefits of selecting each material or metal-based composite for certain applications while also addressing possible setbacks and the toxic effects of the nanomaterials on the environment.

T1  - Metabolomic Profiles of a Midge (Procladius villosimanus, Kieffer) Are Associated with Sediment Contamination in Urban Wetlands
AN  - 1988600112
AB  - Metabolomic techniques are powerful tools for investigating organism-environment interactions. Metabolite profiles have the potential to identify exposure or toxicity before populations are disrupted and can provide useful information for environmental assessment. However, under complex environmental scenarios, metabolomic responses to exposure can be distorted by background and/or organismal variation. In the current study, we use LC-MS (liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry) and GC-MS (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) to measure metabolites of the midge Procladius villosimanus inhabiting 21 urban wetlands. These metabolites were tested against common sediment contaminants using random forest models and metabolite enrichment analysis. Sediment contaminant concentrations in the field correlated with several P. villosimanus metabolites despite natural environmental and organismal variation. Furthermore, enrichment analysis indicated that metabolite sets implicated in stress responses were enriched, pointing to specific cellular functions affected by exposure. Methionine metabolism, sugar metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism associated with total petroleum hydrocarbon and metal concentrations, while mitochondrial electron transport and urea cycle sets associated only with bifenthrin. These results demonstrate the potential for metabolomics approaches to provide useful information in field-based environmental assessments.

T1  - Multi-Spectral Remote Sensing of Phytoplankton Pigment Absorption Properties in Cyanobacteria Bloom Waters: A Regional Example in the Western Basin of Lake Erie
AN  - 1988532501
AB  - Phytoplankton pigments absorb sunlight for photosynthesis, protect the chloroplast from damage caused by excess light energy, and influence the color of the water. Some pigments act as bio-markers and are important for separation of phytoplankton functional types. Among many efforts that have been made to obtain information on phytoplankton pigments from bio-optical properties, Gaussian curves decomposed from phytoplankton absorption spectrum have been used to represent the light absorption of different pigments. We incorporated the Gaussian scheme into a semi-analytical model and obtained the Gaussian curves from remote sensing reflectance. In this study, a series of sensitivity tests were conducted to explore the potential of obtaining the Gaussian curves from multi-spectral satellite remote sensing. Results showed that the Gaussian curves can be retrieved with 35% or less mean unbiased absolute percentage differences from MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-like sensors. Further, using Lake Erie as an example, the spatial distribution of chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations were obtained from the Gaussian curves and used as metrics for the spatial extent of an intense cyanobacterial bloom occurred in Lake Erie in 2014. The seasonal variations of Gaussian absorption properties in 2011 were further obtained from MERIS imagery. This study shows that it is feasible to obtain Gaussian curves from multi-spectral satellite remote sensing data, and the obtained chlorophyll a and phycocyanin concentrations from these Gaussian peak heights demonstrated potential application to monitor harmful algal blooms (HABs) and identification of phytoplankton groups from satellite ocean color remote sensing semi-analytically.

T1  - Rapid and Highly Sensitive Non-Competitive Immunoassay for Specific Detection of Nodularin
AN  - 1952096022
AB  - Nodularin (NOD) is a cyclic penta-peptide hepatotoxin mainly produced by Nodularia spumigena, reported from the brackish water bodies of various parts of the world. It can accumulate in the food chain and, for safety reasons, levels of NOD not only in water bodies but also in food matrices are of interest. Here, we report on a non-competitive immunoassay for the specific detection of NOD. A phage display technique was utilized to interrogate a synthetic antibody phage library for binders recognizing NOD bound to an anti-ADDA (3-Amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyldeca-4(E),6(E)-dienoic acid) monoclonal antibody (Mab). One of the obtained immunocomplex binders, designated SA32C11, showed very high specificity towards nodularin-R (NOD-R) over to the tested 10 different microcystins (microcystin-LR, -dmLR, -RR, -dmRR, -YR, -LY, -LF, -LW, -LA, -WR). It was expressed in Escherichia coli as a single chain antibody fragment (scFv) fusion protein and used to establish a time-resolved fluorometry-based assay in combination with the anti-ADDA Mab. The detection limit (blank + 3SD) of the immunoassay, with a total assay time of 1 h 10 min, is 0.03 µg/L of NOD-R. This represents the most sensitive immunoassay method for the specific detection of NOD reported so far. The assay was tested for its performance to detect NOD using spiked (0.1 to 3 µg/L of NOD-R) water samples including brackish sea and coastal water and the recovery ranged from 79 to 127%. Furthermore, a panel of environmental samples, including water from different sources, fish and other marine tissue specimens, were analyzed for NOD using the assay. The assay has potential as a rapid screening tool for the analysis of a large number of water samples for the presence of NOD. It can also find applications in the analysis of the bioaccumulation of NOD in marine organisms and in the food chain.

T1  - Integrative taxonomy by molecular species delimitation: multi-locus data corroborate a new species of Balkan Drusinae micro-endemics
AN  - 1915211619
AB  - Background 
Taxonomy offers precise species identification and delimitation and thus provides basic information for biological research, e.g. through assessment of species richness. The importance of molecular taxonomy, i.e., the identification and delimitation of taxa based on molecular markers, has increased in the past decade. Recently developed exploratory tools now allow estimating species-level diversity in multi-locus molecular datasets. 
Results 
Here we use molecular species delimitation tools that either quantify differences in intra- and interspecific variability of loci, or divergence times within and between species, or perform coalescent species tree inference to estimate species-level entities in molecular genetic datasets. We benchmark results from these methods against 14 morphologically readily differentiable species of a well-defined subgroup of the diverse Drusinae subfamily (Trichoptera, Limnephilidae). Using a 3798 bp (6 loci) molecular data set we aim to corroborate a geographically isolated new species by integrating comparative morphological studies and molecular taxonomy. 
Conclusions 
Our results indicate that only multi-locus species delimitation provides taxonomically relevant information. The data further corroborate the new species Drusus zivici sp. nov. We provide differential diagnostic characters and describe the male, female and larva of this new species and discuss diversity patterns of Drusinae in the Balkans. We further discuss potential and significance of molecular species delimitation. Finally we argue that enhancing collaborative integrative taxonomy will accelerate assessment of global diversity and completion of reference libraries for applied fields, e.g., conservation and biomonitoring.

T1  - Expert Decision Support Technique for Algal Bloom Governance in Urban Lakes Based on Text Analysis
AN  - 1910586103
AB  - As a typical phenomenon of eutrophication pollution, algal bloom threatens public health and water security. The governance of algal bloom is largely affected by administrators’ knowledge and experience, which may lead to a subjective and one-sided decision-making result. Meanwhile, experts in the specific field can provide professional support. How to utilize expert resources adequately and automatically has been a problem. This paper proposes an expert decision support technique for algal bloom governance based on text analysis methods. Firstly, the decision support mechanism is introduced to form a general decision-making framework. Secondly, the expert classification method is proposed to help with choosing suitable experts. Thirdly, a multi-criteria group decision-making method is presented based on the automatic analysis of experts’ decision opinions. Finally, an experiment is conducted to verify the expert decision support technique. The results show the technique’s feasibility and rationality. This paper describes experts’ information and opinions with natural language, which can intuitively reflect the natural meaning. The expert decision support technique based on text analysis broadens the management thought of water pollution in urban lakes.

T1  - Identification of wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) intercepted in trade-associated solid wood packaging material using DNA barcoding and morphology
AN  - 1899507348
AB  - Global trade facilitates the inadvertent movement of insect pests and subsequent establishment of populations outside their native ranges. Despite phytosanitary measures, nonnative insects arrive at United States (U.S.) ports of entry as larvae in solid wood packaging material (SWPM). Identification of wood-boring larval insects is important for pest risk analysis and management, but is difficult beyond family level due to highly conserved morphology. Therefore, we integrated DNA barcoding and rearing of larvae to identify wood-boring insects in SWPM. From 2012 to 2015, we obtained larvae of 338 longhorned beetles (Cerambycidae) and 38 metallic wood boring beetles (Buprestidae) intercepted in SWPM associated with imported products at six U.S. ports. We identified 265 specimens to species or genus using DNA barcodes. Ninety-three larvae were reared to adults and identified morphologically. No conflict was found between the two approaches, which together identified 275 cerambycids (23 genera) and 16 buprestids (4 genera). Our integrated approach confirmed novel DNA barcodes for seven species (10 specimens) of woodborers not in public databases. This study demonstrates the utility of DNA barcoding as a tool for regulatory agencies. We provide important documentation of potential beetle pests that may cross country borders through the SWPM pathway.

T1  - Selective Feeding and Microalgal Consumption Rates by Crown-Of-Thorns Seastar (Acanthaster cf. solaris) Larvae
AN  - 1889003124
AB  - Outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns seastar (CoTS) represent a major cause of coral loss on the Great Barrier Reef. Outbreaks can be explained by enhanced larval survival supported by higher phytoplankton availability after flood events, yet little is known about CoTS larvae feeding behaviour, in particular their potential for selective feeding. Here, single- and mixed-species feeding experiment were conducted on CoTS larvae using five algae (Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Pavlova lutheri, Tisochrysis lutea, Dunaliella sp. and Chaetoceros sp.) and two algal concentrations (1000 and 2500 algae•mL−1). Cell counts using flow-cytometry at the beginning and end of each incubation experiment allowed us to calculate the filtration and ingestion rates of each species by CoTS larvae. In line with previous studies, CoTS larvae ingested more algae when the initial algal concentration was higher. We found evidence for the selective ingestion of some species (Chaetoceros sp., Dunaliella sp.) over others (P. lutheri, P. tricornutum). The preferred algal species had the highest energy content, suggesting that CoTS selectively ingested the most energetic algae. Ultimately, combining these results with spatio-temporal patterns in phytoplankton communities will help elucidate the role of larval feeding behaviour in determining the frequency and magnitude of CoTS outbreaks.

T1  - Implications for management and conservation of the population genetic structure of the wedge clam Donax trunculus across two biogeographic boundaries
AN  - 1899439326
AB  - In a resource management perspective, the understanding of the relative influence of the physical factors on species connectivity remains a major challenge and is also of great ecological and conservation biology interest. Despite the overfishing threat on the wedge clam Donax trunculus in Europe, relatively little information is known about its population genetic structure and connectivity and their consequences on conservation policies. We employed 16 microsatellite loci to characterise the genetic diversity and population structure of D. trunculus. A total of 514 samples from seven different localities along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition, from the Atlantic (Gulf of Cádiz) to the north-western Mediterranean were genotyped. The analysis of the population genetic structure displayed a clear distinction along the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition with different clusters in the Atlantic Ocean, the Alboran Sea and the northwestern Mediterranean. Consequently, we recommend that these three areas should be considered as different management units. We showed that all populations seem to be at high long-term risk of extinction with the exception of the protected Doñana National Park population which still seems to have evolutionary potential. Therefore, our results emphasized the necessity of protection of this economic resource and the validity of molecular tools to evaluate the population dynamics.

T1  - Matching Forces Applied in Underwater Hull Cleaning with Adhesion Strength of Marine Organisms
AN  - 1858321348
AB  - Biofouling is detrimental to the hydrodynamic performance of ships. In spite of advances in hull coating technology, a ship must usually undergo underwater hull cleaning to remove biofouling during her in-service time. However, some cleaning practices may also lead to decreased lifetime of the fouling-control coating. Therefore, cleaning forces should be minimized, according to the adhesion strength of marine organisms present on the hull. In this article, values of adhesion strength found in available literature are discussed in the light of current knowledge on hull cleaning technology. Finally, the following knowledge gaps are identified: (1) data on adhesion strength of naturally-occurring biofouling communities are practically absent; (2) shear forces imparted by current cleaning devices on low-form fouling (microfouling) and corresponding effects on hull coatings are largely unknown. This knowledge would be valuable for both developers and users of cleaning technology.

T1  - Shell properties of commercial clam Chamelea gallina are influenced by temperature and solar radiation along a wide latitudinal gradient
AN  - 1899330398
AB  - Phenotype can express different morphologies in response to biotic or abiotic environmental influences. Mollusks are particularly sensitive to different environmental parameters, showing macroscale shell morphology variations in response to environmental parameters. Few studies concern shell variations at the different scale levels along environmental gradients. Here, we investigate shell features at the macro, micro and nanoscale, in populations of the commercially important clam Chamelea gallina along a latitudinal gradient (~400 km) of temperature and solar radiation in the Adriatic Sea (Italian cost). Six populations of clams with shells of the same length were analyzed. Shells from the warmest and the most irradiated population were thinner, with more oval shape, more porous and lighter, showing lower load fracture. However, no variation was observed in shell CaCO3 polymorphism (100% aragonite) or in compositional and textural shell parameters, indicating no effect of the environmental parameters on the basic processes of biomineralization. Because of the importance of this species as commercial resource in the Adriatic Sea, the experimentally quantified and significant variations of mass and fracture load in C. gallina shells along the latitudinal gradient may have economic implications for fisheries producing different economical yield for fishermen and consumers along the Adriatic coastline.

T1  - Seasonal Cyclicity in Trace Elements and Stable Isotopes of Modern Horse Enamel
AN  - 1842507480
AB  - The study of stable isotopes in fossil bioapatite has yielded useful results and has shown that bioapatites are able to faithfully record paleo-environmental and paleo-climatic parameters from archeological to geological timescales. In an effort to establish new proxies for the study of bioapatites, intra-tooth records of enamel carbonate stable isotope ratios from a modern horse are compared with trace element profiles measured using laboratory micro X-Ray Fluorescence scanning. Using known patterns of tooth eruption and the relationship between stable oxygen isotopes and local temperature seasonality, an age model is constructed that links records from six cheek upper right teeth from the second premolar to the third molar. When plotted on this age model, the trace element ratios from horse tooth enamel show a seasonal pattern with a small shift in phase compared to stable oxygen isotope ratios. While stable oxygen and carbon isotopes in tooth enamel are forced respectively by the state of the hydrological cycle and the animal’s diet, we argue that the seasonal signal in trace elements reflects seasonal changes in dust intake and diet of the animal. The latter explanation is in agreement with seasonal changes observed in carbon isotopes of the same teeth. This external forcing of trace element composition in mammal tooth enamel implies that trace element ratios may be used as proxies for seasonal changes in paleo-environment and paleo-diet.

T1  - Evaluation of Genotoxic Pressure along the Sava River
AN  - 1819907339
AB  - In this study we have performed a comprehensive genotoxicological survey along the 900 rkm of the Sava River. In total, 12 sites were chosen in compliance with the goals of GLOBAQUA project dealing with the effects of multiple stressors on biodiversity and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. The genotoxic potential was assessed using a complex battery of bioassays performed in prokaryotes and aquatic eukaryotes (freshwater fish). Battery comprised evaluation of mutagenicity by SOS/umuC test in Salmonella typhimurium TA1535/pSK1002. The level of DNA damage as a biomarker of exposure (comet assay) and biomarker of effect (micronucleus assay) and the level of oxidative stress as well (Fpg—modified comet assay) was studied in blood cells of bleak and spirlin (Alburnus alburnus/Alburnoides bipunctatus respectively). Result indicated differential sensitivity of applied bioassays in detection of genotoxic pressure. The standard and Fpg—modified comet assay showed higher potential in differentiation of the sites based on genotoxic potential in comparison with micronucleus assay and SOS/umuC test. Our data represent snapshot of the current status of the river which indicates the presence of genotoxic potential along the river which can be traced to the deterioration of quality of the Sava River by communal and industrial wastewaters. The major highlight of the study is that we have provided complex set of data obtained from a single source (homogeneity of analyses for all samples).

T1  - Development and Validation of a Biodynamic Model for Mechanistically Predicting Metal Accumulation in Fish-Parasite Systems
AN  - 1813193988
AB  - Because of different reported effects of parasitism on the accumulation of metals in fish, it is important to consider parasites while interpreting bioaccumulation data from biomonitoring programmes. Accordingly, the first step is to take parasitism into consideration when simulating metal bioaccumulation in the fish host under laboratory conditions. In the present study, the accumulation of metals in fish-parasite systems was simulated by a one-compartment toxicokinetic model and compared to uninfected conspecifics. As such, metal accumulation in fish was assumed to result from a balance of different uptake and loss processes depending on the infection status. The uptake by parasites was considered an efflux from the fish host, similar to elimination. Physiological rate constants for the uninfected fish were parameterised based on the covalent index and the species weight while the parameterisation for the infected fish was carried out based on the reported effects of parasites on the uptake kinetics of the fish host. The model was then validated for the system of the chub Squalius cephalus and the acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus tereticollis following 36-day exposure to waterborne Pb. The dissolved concentration of Pb in the exposure tank water fluctuated during the exposure, ranging from 40 to 120 μg/L. Generally, the present study shows that the one-compartment model can be an effective method for simulating the accumulation of metals in fish, taking into account effects of parasitism. In particular, the predicted concentrations of Cu, Fe, Zn, and Pb in the uninfected chub as well as in the infected chub and the acanthocephalans were within one order of magnitude of the measurements. The variation in the absorption efficiency and the elimination rate constant of the uninfected chub resulted in variations of about one order of magnitude in the predicted concentrations of Pb. Inclusion of further assumptions for simulating metal accumulation in the infected chub led to variations of around two orders of magnitude in the predictions. Therefore, further research is required to reduce uncertainty while characterising and parameterising the model for infected fish.

T1  - Assessing Ecological Status of Transitional and Coastal Waters; Current Difficulties and Alternative Approaches
AN  - 2307425792
AB  - The environmental monitoring strategy termed ecosystem-based approach (EBA) underlines the obvious benefits of managing natural resources on a holistic level, and it is particularly invoked for the rational and sustainable management of aquatic resources. However, when coming to implement EBA into monitoring schemes, such as those derived from the implementation of the European legislation concerning water quality, difficulties inherent to the complex and dynamic nature of ecosystems arise, including (i) identify appropriate, relevant and easily measurable indicators of ecosystem integrity, and (ii) combine the heterogeneous information gathered at the different levels of organization included in an ecosystem into a simple and practical decision-making scheme. The first kind of difficulties maybe partially overcome by implementing monitoring schemes which take into account the hierarchical nature of ecosystem processes and did not neglect the use of indicators at low levels of biological organization, including ecotoxicological biomarkers and bioassays. Secondly, the integration of the monitoring results into a practical decision-making scheme can best be achieved by using non metric multivariate analysis, which is especially suitable for data bases including different metrics, and allows the processing of variables showing non-monotonic response to human stress, from molecular biomarkers to community indices. The difficulties inherent to the current rigid scheme of water quality assessment heavily based on ratio-to-reference univariate indicators and arbitrary reference values and class boundaries for each single indicator are illustrated with a case study in the Minho estuary (NW Iberian Peninsula). The classification of aquatic ecosystems into discrete categories of ecological status can best be achieved by combining observations at different levels of biological organization, from molecular biomarkers to community traits, with explicative physicochemical and hydromorphological elements, and by using non-metric multivariate analysis techniques.

T1  - Mercury Accumulation, and the Mercury-PCB-Sex Interaction, in Lake Whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis)
AN  - 2124634359
AB  - We determined whole-fish Hg concentrations of 26 female and 34 male adult lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) from northern Lake Huron captured during November 2010. Subsampling from these 60 fish, Hg concentration was also determined in both somatic tissue and ovaries (n = 5), while methylmercury (MeHg) concentration was determined in whole fish (n = 18). Bioenergetics modeling was used to assess the growth dilution effect on the difference in Hg concentrations between the sexes. Mean whole-fish Hg concentration in females (59.9 ng/g) was not significantly different from mean whole-fish Hg concentration in males (54.4 ng/g). MeHg accounted for 91% of the mercury found in the lake whitefish. Bioenergetics modeling results indicated that the growth dilution effect did not contribute to the difference in Hg concentrations between the sexes. We estimated that females increased in Hg concentration by 17.9%, on average, immediately after spawning due to release of eggs. Using polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) data for the same 60 lake whitefish from a previous study, we detected a significant interaction between sex and contaminant type (Hg or PCBs), which was attributable to males being significantly higher in PCB concentration than females. Males may be eliminating Hg at a faster rate than females.

T1  - Sediment Quality Assessment:&nbsp;A Practical Guide
AN  - 2134977039
AB  - Contaminated sediments represent an ongoing threat to the health of aquatic ecosystems. The assessment of sediment quality is, therefore, an important concern for environmental regulators. Sediment quality guidelines are now well established in regulatory frameworks worldwide; however, practical guidance that covers all of the key aspects of sediment quality assessment is not readily available. 
In 2005, CSIRO published its highly cited 
Handbook for Sediment Quality Assessment. In the ensuing period, the science has advanced considerably. This practical guide is a revised and much expanded second edition, which will be a valuable tool for environmental practitioners. 
Written by experts in the field, it provides coverage of: sediment sampling; sample preparation; chemical analysis; ecotoxicology; bioaccumulation; biomarkers; and ecological assessment. In addition, detailed appendices describe protocols for many of the tests to be used.

T1  - Leading a Pest to Its Demise by the Nose: Scientists look to pheromones as a safer way of ridding the Great Lakes of lampreys
AN  - 2310680121
AB  - For all the havoc that zebra mussels, Asian carp, round gobies and dozens of other alien species have wrought on the Great Lakes, those waters have never known a foe like the sea lamprey. The vampirelike parasites cost many millions each year in depleted fisheries and eradication efforts.

T1  - Drones, dogs vs. nature's invaders: Scientists employ innovative techniques to combat destructive foreign species
AN  - 1762621648
AB  - In 2011, calling invasive species "a growing environmental and economic threat to Ontario," the province established an Invasive Species Centre in Sault Ste.  Because the province imports more goods from more places in the world than any other part of Canada, it runs the greatest risk of invasive species inadvertently arriving in packaging, containers, ships or ballast water.

T1  - Analysis of Sources and Sinks of Mercury in the Urban Water Cycle of Frankfurt am Main, Germany
AN  - 1748568897
AB  - Mercury (Hg) is still a focus of environmental research, since its levels in fish frequently exceed the Environmental Quality Standard (EQS) of 20 µg/kg for biota defined by the European Water Framework Directive (Directive 2008/105/EC). Current Hg levels in Abramis brama from German rivers are in the range of 73-346 µg/kg wet weight (2009) and exceed the EQS by a factor of 3.7-17.3. Therefore, it is important to identify the sources of Hg pollution in the aquatic environment and to develop effective strategies for reducing the input into associated river systems. The aim of the present study was to analyze Hg in the urban water cycle of the city of Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Samples were taken from the river Main crosscutting the city and its tributaries. In addition, precipitation, stormwater runoff, effluents of two municipal WWTPs, and stormwater management structures such as combined sewer overflows and stormwater retention basins have been analyzed. Loads of Hg have been determined based on the measured concentrations and a Hg mass balance for the aquatic system was created. A total of 160 water samples were analyzed by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (CVAFS) according to US EPA Method 1631. Results from the mass balance have shown that approximately 5 kg Hg/a enter and 15 kg Hg/a leave the study area of Frankfurt am Main via the river Main. The largest amount of Hg (24.58 kg/a) throughout the urban water cycle of Frankfurt am Main is transported via wastewater. However, municipal WWTPs in Frankfurt am Main have been identified as the largest Hg sink, since 99.7% (24.5 kg/a) of the Hg is shifted from the sewage water and stormwater during treatment into the sewage sludge. Thus, the increase of the Hg load in the river Main from 5 to 15 kg/a has to be attributed to other sources such as 3 industrial WWTPs, groundwater and non-treated stormwater runoff during heavy rain events.

T1  - Testing for relationships between individual crab behavior and metabolic rate across ecological contexts
AN  - 1700275656
AB  - Two classes of explanations for covariation between activity level and metabolic rate among conspecifics have been proposed. First, individual-level variation in activity exhibited during the measurement of metabolic rate should covary with routine metabolic rate because movement increases respiration (a methodological relationship). Second, energetic-based hypotheses posit relationships between individual activity measured under more natural conditions and baseline measures of metabolic rate, among other behavioral, physiological, and life-history traits (functional relationships). Here, we examined these potential relationships between individual behavior and metabolic rate in the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii). Specifically, we tested for (1) an effect of crab activity in metabolic chambers (activity^sub chamber^) on routine metabolic rate (RMR), and (2) an effect of crab activity in mesocosms that mimicked field conditions (activity^sub mesocosm^) on standard metabolic rate (SMR). To test for context dependence, we assessed both activity-metabolic rate relationships in the absence and presence of predation threat from toadfish (Opsanus tau) in the form of waterborne chemical cues. Individual variation in activity^sub mesocosm^ and RMR was repeatable over time. In support of a methodological relationship, individual differences in RMR were partially explained by crab activity^sub chamber^. After accounting for this methodological relationship, individual SMR was inversely related to activity^sub mesocosm^, supporting an allocation model that predicts behavior and baseline metabolic rate compete for finite energy reserves. We found no evidence of context dependence in either activity-metabolic rate relationship. Thus, our study emphasizes the importance of considering methodological artifacts in elucidating functional relationships between individual behavior and energetics.

T1  - Colonization of diatoms and bacteria on artificial substrates in the northeastern coastal Adriatic Sea
AN  - 1754645578
AB  - Every surface that is immersed in seawater becomes rapidly covered with an unavoidable biofilm. Such biofilm formation, also known as fouling, is a complex multistage process and not yet thoroughly investigated. In this study, the succession of diatoms and bacteria was investigated during a one month exposure on an artificial substrate of plexiglass (polymer of methyl methacrylate) mounted above the seafloor at a depth of 5 m. For biofilm analyses, the fouling was investigated using selective agar plates, epifluorescence, light and electronic microscopy, as well as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) pigment analysis. During biofilm development, the abundance of all biofilm components increased and reached maximum values after a one month exposure. In the bacterial community, heterotrophic marine bacteria were dominant and reached 1.96 ± 0.79 × 10[4] colony forming units (CFU) cm[-2]. Despite the fact that faecal coliforms and intestinal enterococci were detected in the water column, faecal coliforms were not detected in the biofilm and intestinal enterococci appeared after one month of exposure but in the negligible number of 60 ± 10 CFU cm[-2]. The phototrophic component of the biofilm was dominated by diatoms and reached a concentration of 6.10 × 10[5] cells cm[-2], which was supported by pigment analysis with fucoxanthin as dominant pigment in a concentration up to 110 ng cm[-2]. The diatom community was dominated by Cylindrotheca closterium and other pennate benthic diatoms. A detailed taxonomic analysis by electronic microscopy revealed 30 different taxa of diatoms. The study confirmed that a plexiglass surface in a marine environment is susceptible to biofouling within 30 days of contact. Furthermore, the co lonization process sequence firstly involved bacteria and cyanobacteria, and secondly diatoms, which together formed a primary biofilm in the sea.

T1  - Invasive crab makes strange appearance in Cootes Paradise: Asian creature likely came to Great Lakes via ballast water
AN  - 1690354349
AB  - The crab requires saltwater to bear offspring and that's not something a crab in Hamilton Harbour could reasonably find. The St. Lawrence Seaway does not become salty enough until Quebec City, nearly 900 kilometres away from Hamilton.              There have been occasional discoveries of the crab in the Great Lakes over the years, but Monday's was the first report in Hamilton Harbour. [Hugh MacIsaac] says the creature probably found its way to the harbour in the ballast water of a ship.              The fishway has been operating since 1996, recording dozens of species, from common carp to brown bullheads. The harbour has seen some increases in desirable species of fish, most notably with yellow perch, but not nearly to the extent that scientists involved in harbour remediation had hoped.

T1  - Marsh Mud and Mummichogs:&nbsp;An Intimate Natural History of Coastal Georgia
AN  - 2131401407
AB  - “This book,” writes marine biologist Evelyn B. Sherr, “is meant to give others an understanding of the fascinating life of the region, from the smallest creatures in marsh mud and estuarine water, to the mummichogs and multitudes of other animals that find food and shelter in the vast expanses of marsh grass, in the sounds, and along the beaches of the Georgia Isles.” Sherr not only spent years doing research in coastal Georgia, she began her family there. Although Sherr’s career would take her around the world, this special place stuck with her. Here she shares her deep knowledge of the remarkable environment that she, her scientist husband, and their two children explored time and again.
 Dr. Sherr is the ideal companion with whom to discover coastal Georgia. She points out its swimming, running, flying, drifting, and wriggling wildlife—and tells how it all exists in balance in a landscape subject to its own daily ebbs and flows, its own seasonal cycles. As we learn about Georgia’s distinctive intertidal salt marshes, subtidal estuaries, and open beaches and dunes, Sherr reveals the creatures that support—and are supported by—these habitats: the microbes in estuarine water and in marsh mud; the zooplankton swarming in the tidal rivers and sounds; and numerous fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

T1  - Effects of a major municipal effluent on the St. Lawrence River: A case study
AN  - 1671990306
AB  - The St. Lawrence River (SLR) is the second largest waterway in North America. The discharge of the City of Montreal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) represents the largest volume of treated wastewaters being released into the river. It also ranks as the largest sewage treatment plant of its kind in North America. Over the last decade, intensive multidisciplinary research has focused on assessing the impacts of Montreal wastewater effluents on the SLR. We describe the major findings of these investigations, including the determination of the fate of contaminants, bioaccumulation in fish and invertebrates, ecotoxicological measurements of aquatic animal health, evaluation of endocrine disruption, parasitism in fish, and combined effects of multiple stressors on the SLR. Impacts of the effluents from the WWTP on aquatic organisms from the SLR are both toxicological and ecological, demonstrating the need for an integrated view of the impacts of municipal effluents on aquatic ecosystems.

T1  - The Ecology of Agricultural Landscapes:&nbsp;Long-Term Research on the Path to Sustainability
AN  - 2135202083
AB  - Evidence has been mounting for some time that intensive row-crop agriculture as practiced in developed countries may not be environmentally sustainable, with concerns increasingly being raised about climate change, implications for water quantity and quality, and soil degradation. This volume synthesizes two decades of research on the sustainability of temperate, row-crop ecosystems of the Midwestern United States. The overarching hypothesis guiding this work has been that more biologically based management practices could greatly reduce negative impacts while maintaining sufficient productivity to meet demands for food, fiber and fuel, but that roadblocks to their adoption persist because we lack a comprehensive understanding of their benefits and drawbacks.The research behind this book, based at the Kellogg Biological Station (Michigan State University) and conducted under the aegis of the Long-term Ecological Research network, is structured on a foundation of large-scale field experiments that explore alternatives to conventional, chemical-intensive agriculture. Studies have explored the biophysical underpinnings of crop productivity, the interactions of crop ecosystems with the hydrology and biodiversity of the broader landscapes in which they lie, farmers' views about alternative practices, economic valuation of ecosystem services, and global impacts such as greenhouse gas exchanges with the atmosphere. In contrast to most research projects, the long-term design of this research enables identification of slow or delayed processes of change in response to management regimes, and allows examination of responses across a broader range of climatic variability. This volume synthesizes this comprehensive inquiry into the ecology of alternative cropping systems, identifying future steps needed on the path to sustainability.

T1  - Transcriptional Responses of Glutathione Transferase Genes in Ruditapes philippinarum Exposed to Microcystin-LR
AN  - 1676135376
AB  - Glutathione Transferases (GSTs) are phase II detoxification enzymes known to be involved in the molecular response against microcystins (MCs) induced toxicity. However, the individual role of the several GST isoforms in the MC detoxification process is still unknown. In this study, the time-dependent changes on gene expression of several GST isoforms (pi, mu, sigma 1, sigma 2) in parallel with enzymatic activity of total GST were investigated in gills and hepatopancreas of the bivalve Ruditapes philippinarum exposed to pure MC-LR (10 and 100 µg/L). No significant changes in GST enzyme activities were found on both organs. In contrast, MC-LR affected the transcriptional activities of these detoxification enzymes both in gills and hepatopancreas. GST transcriptional changes in gills promoted by MC-LR were characterized by an early (12 h) induction of mu and sigma 1 transcripts. On the other hand, the GST transcriptional changes in hepatopancreas were characterized by a later induction (48 h) of mu transcript, but also by an early inhibition (6 h) of the four transcripts. The different transcription patterns obtained for the tested GST isoforms in this study highlight the potential divergent physiological roles played by these isoenzymes during the detoxification of MC-LR.

T1  - Assessing the Antimicrobial Activity of Polyisoprene Based Surfaces
AN  - 1792812833
AB  - There has been an intense research effort in the last decades in the field of biofouling prevention as it concerns many aspects of everyday life and causes problems to devices, the environment, and human health. Many different antifouling and antimicrobial materials have been developed to struggle against bacteria and other micro- and macro-organism attachment to different surfaces. However the "miracle solution" has still to be found. The research presented here concerns the synthesis of bio-based polymeric materials and the biological tests that showed their antifouling and, at the same time, antibacterial activity. The raw material used for the coating synthesis was natural rubber. The polyisoprene chains were fragmented to obtain oligomers, which had reactive chemical groups at their chain ends, therefore they could be modified to insert polymerizable and biocidal groups. Films were obtained by radical photopolymerization of the natural rubber derived oligomers and their structure was altered, in order to understand the mechanism of attachment inhibition and to increase the efficiency of the anti-biofouling action. The adhesion of three species of pathogenic bacteria and six strains of marine bacteria was studied. The coatings were able to inhibit bacterial attachment by contact, as it was verified that no detectable leaching of toxic molecules occurred.

T1  - Environmental Geochemistry of Cerium: Applications and Toxicology of Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles
AN  - 1660504346
AB  - Cerium is the most abundant of rare-earth metals found in the Earth's crust. Several Ce-carbonate, -phosphate, -silicate, and -(hydr)oxide minerals have been historically mined and processed for pharmaceutical uses and industrial applications. Of all Ce minerals, cerium dioxide has received much attention in the global nanotechnology market due to their useful applications for catalysts, fuel cells, and fuel additives. A recent mass flow modeling study predicted that a major source of CeO^sub 2^ nanoparticles from industrial processing plants (e.g., electronics and optics manufactures) is likely to reach the terrestrial environment such as landfills and soils. The environmental fate of CeO^sub 2^ nanoparticles is highly dependent on its physcochemical properties in low temperature geochemical environment. Though there are needs in improving the analytical method in detecting/quantifying CeO^sub 2^ nanoparticles in different environmental media, it is clear that aquatic and terrestrial organisms have been exposed to CeO^sub 2^ NPs, potentially yielding in negative impact on human and ecosystem health. Interestingly, there has been contradicting reports about the toxicological effects of CeO^sub 2^ nanoparticles, acting as either an antioxidant or reactive oxygen species production-inducing agent). This poses a challenge in future regulations for the CeO^sub 2^ nanoparticle application and the risk assessment in the environment.

T1  - Cadmium Accumulation and Metallothionein Biosynthesis in Cadmium-Treated Freshwater Mussel Anodonta woodiana
AN  - 1656452065
AB  - This study investigated the distribution of cadmium (Cd) and the protein level of metallothionein (MT) and examined the relationship of Cd accumulation and the MT concentration in different tissues of freshwater mussel Anodonta woodiana following Cd treatment. The mussels were exposed to Cd (4.21, 8.43, 16.86, 33.72 and 67.45 mg L-1) for 24, 48, 72 and 96 h, respectively. After Cd treatment, the gills, mantle, foot, visceral mass and digestive gland tissues were collected for analysis. We found that, in the controls, Cd distributed in all tissues in the concentration order of gills>mantle>foot>visceral mass>digestive gland. Upon Cd treatment, Cd concentration significantly increased in all tissues. The highest Cd accumulation was found in the digestive gland, which was 0.142 mg g-1 (P<0.05). MT levels in the gills and mantle of the mussels increased significantly (P<0.05), which were in positive correlation with Cd accumulation in the tissues (P<0.05). In conclusion, our results demonstrated a correlation between Cd accumulation and MT up-regulation in gills and mantle of the mussels after Cd treatment. It is suggested that the protein level of MT in gills and mantle of Anodonta woodiana is a good biomarker for Cd contamination.

T1  - Description of two new filtering carnivore Drusus species (Limnephilidae, Drusinae) from the Western Balkans
AN  - 2170316335
AB  - Two new species of the genus  Drusus  ( Trichoptera, Limnephilidae, Drusinae ) from the Western Balkans are described. Additionally, observations on the biodiversity and threats to the region’s endemic aquatic fauna are discussed.  Drusus krpachi  sp. n. is a micro-endemic of the Korab Mountains, Macedonia, and  Drusus malickyi  sp. n. is a micro-endemic of the Prokletije Mountains, Albania. Both new species are most similar to  Drusus macedonicus  but differ from the latter in the shape of segment IX, the shape of the tips of the intermediate appendages in lateral view, the shape of the inferior appendages, and the form and shape of the parameres. In addition, males of the European species of filtering carnivore Drusinae are diagnosed and illustrated, including  Cryptothrix nebulicola  McLachlan,  Drusus chrysotus  Rambur,  Drusus discolor  Rambur,  Drusus macedonicus  Schmid,  Drusus meridionalis  Kumanski,  Drusus muelleri  McLachlan,  Drusus romanicus  Murgoci and Botosaneanu, and  Drusus siveci  Malicky. These additions to the Western Balkan fauna demonstrate the significance of this region for European biodiversity and further highlight the importance of faunistic studies in Europe.

T1  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in sediment and fish tissues from Lake Chaohu, central eastern China
AN  - 1861116086
AB  - Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) levels in environmental media have increased over the last 20-25 years in the world. In aquatic environments PBDEs were found to be accumulated along food chain and Endocrine disruptors toxicity. In this study PBDEs were investigated in sediment and fish tissues from Lake Chaohu in central eastern China. There were 10 PBDEs congeners detected out of all 41 PBDEs. BDE-47 was of the highest with 5.17 ng/g in sediment and 58.47 ng/g in fish. PBDEs were evenly distributed across the surface sediment in the whole lake. It implied that the main source of PBDEs may not be an inflow river like Nanfei. Tissue distribution patterns of PBDEs in four fish species were in the order of BDE-47 > BDE-99 > BDE-100 > BDE-66 > BDE-138 > BDE-183 > BDE-154 > BDE-153. Octa- and deca-BDEs were below the detection limit. The concentrations of all PBDE congeners were higher in gills, livers, and kidneys than those in muscles and adipose tissue. Furthermore, PBDEs in different tissues had some different distribution patterns with fish size. Those discrepancies appeared to be correlated with the PBDEs pollution fluxes varying with the change of the year and their metabolism divergences in fish tissues.

T1  - The Expression of Pre- and Postcopulatory Sexually Selected Traits Reflects Levels of Dietary Stress in Guppies
AN  - 2014436336
AB  - Environmental and ecological conditions can shape the evolution of life history traits in many animals. Among such factors, food or nutrition availability can play an important evolutionary role in moderating an animal's life history traits, particularly sexually selected traits. Here, we test whether diet quantity and/or composition in the form of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (here termed ‘n3LC’) influence the expression of pre- and postcopulatory traits in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a livebearing poeciliid fish. We assigned males haphazardly to one of two experimental diets supplemented with n3LC, and each of these diet treatments was further divided into two diet ‘quantity’ treatments. Our experimental design therefore explored the main and interacting effects of two factors (n3LC content and diet quantity) on the expression of precopulatory (sexual behaviour and sexual ornamentation, including the size, number and spectral properties of colour spots) and postcopulatory (the velocity, viability, number and length of sperm) sexually selected traits. Our study revealed that diet quantity had significant effects on most of the pre- and postcopulatory traits, while n3LC manipulation had a significant effect on sperm traits and in particular on sperm viability. Our analyses also revealed interacting effects of diet quantity and n3LC levels on courtship displays, and the area of orange and iridescent colour spots in the males’ colour patterns. We also confirmed that our dietary manipulations of n3LC resulted in the differential uptake of n3LC in body and testes tissues in the different n3LC groups. This study reveals the effects of diet quantity and n3LC on behavioural, ornamental and ejaculate traits in P. reticulata and underscores the likely role that diet plays in maintaining the high variability in these condition-dependent sexual traits.

T1  - Local-Scale Diversity and Between-Year “Frozen Evolution” of Avian Influenza A Viruses in Nature
AN  - 1549924502
AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) in wild bird reservoir hosts is characterized by the perpetuation in a plethora of subtype and genotype constellations. Multiyear monitoring studies carried out during the last two decades worldwide have provided a large body of knowledge regarding the ecology of IAV in wild birds. Nevertheless, other issues of avian IAV evolution have not been fully elucidated, such as the complexity and dynamics of genetic interactions between the co-circulating IAV genomes taking place at a local-scale level or the phenomenon of frozen evolution. We investigated the IAV diversity in a mallard population residing in a single pond in the Czech Republic. Despite the relative small number of samples collected, remarkable heterogeneity was revealed with four different IAV subtype combinations, H6N2, H6N9, H11N2, and H11N9, and six genomic constellations in co-circulation. Moreover, the H6, H11, and N2 segments belonged to two distinguishable sub-lineages. A reconstruction of the pattern of genetic reassortment revealed direct parent-progeny relationships between the H6N2, H11N9 and H6N9 viruses. Interestingly the IAV, with the H6N9 subtype, was re-detected a year later in a genetically unchanged form in the close proximity of the original sampling locality. The almost absolute nucleotide sequence identity of all the respective genomic segments between the two H6N9 viruses indicates frozen evolution as a result of prolonged conservation in the environment. The persistence of the H6N9 IAV in various abiotic and biotic environmental components was also discussed.

T1  - Lanthanum from a Modified Clay Used in Eutrophication Control Is Bioavailable to the Marbled Crayfish (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis)
AN  - 1548811375
AB  - To mitigate eutrophication in fresh standing waters the focus is on phosphorus (P) control, i.e. on P inflows to a lake as well as a lake's sediment as internal P source. The in-lake application of the lanthanum (La) modified clays – i.e. La modified bentonite (Phoslock) or La modified kaolinite, aim at dephosphatising the water column and at reducing the release of P from a lake's sediment. Application of these clays raises the question whether La from these clays can become bioavailable to biota. We investigated the bioavailability of La from Phoslock in a controlled parallel groups experiment in which we measured the La in carapace, gills, ovaries, hepatopancreas and abdominal muscle after 0, 14 and 28 days of exposure to Phoslock. Expressing the treatment effect as the difference of the median concentration between the two treatment groups (Phoslock minus control group) yield the following effects, the plus sign (+) indicating an increase, concentrations in µg g−1 dry weight: Day 14: carapace +10.5 µg g−1, gills +112 µg g−1, ovaries +2.6 µg g−1, hepatopancreas +32.9 µg g−1 and abodminal muscle +3.2 µg g−1. Day 28: carapace +17.9 µg g−1; gills +182 µg g−1; ovaries +2.2 µg g−1; hepatopancreas +41.9 µg g−1 and abodminal muscle +7.6 µg g−1, all effects were statistically significant. As La from Phoslock is bio-available to and taken up by the marbled crayfishes (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis), we advocate that the application of in-lake chemical water treatments to mitigate eutrophication should be accompanied by a thorough study on potential side effects.

AN  - 2131433565
AB  - "Microbial Biodegradation and Bioremediation" brings together experts in relevant fields to describe the successful application of microbes and their derivatives for bioremediation of potentially toxic and relatively novel compounds. This single-source reference encompasses all categories of pollutants and their applications in a convenient, comprehensive package. 
Our natural biodiversity and environment is in danger due to the release of continuously emerging potential pollutants by anthropogenic activities. Though many attempts have been made to eradicate and remediate these noxious elements, every day thousands of xenobiotics of relatively new entities emerge, thus worsening the situation. Primitive microorganisms are highly adaptable to toxic environments, and can reduce the load of toxic elements by their successful transformation and remediation. 
Describes many novel approaches of microbial bioremediation including genetic engineering, metagenomics, microbial fuel cell technology, biosurfactants and biofilm-based bioremediationIntroduces relatively new hazardous elements and their bioremediation practices including oil spills, military waste water, greenhouse gases, polythene wastes, and moreProvides the most advanced techniques in the field of bioremediation, including insilico approach, microbes as pollution indicators, use of bioreactors, techniques of pollution monitoring, and more

T1  - Sustainable Water Engineering:&nbsp;Theory and Practice
AN  - 2130855869
AB  - Ensuring safe and plentiful supplies of potable water (both now and for future generations) and developing sustainable treatment processes for wastewater are among the world's greatest engineering challenges. However, sustainability requires investment of money, time and knowledge. Some parts of the world are already working towards this goal but many nations have neither the political will nor the resources to tackle even basic provision and sanitation. Combining theory and practice from the developing and developed worlds with high- and low-tech, high- and low-cost solutions, this book discusses fundamental and advanced aspects of water engineering and includes:
 
 
 
water resource issues including climate change, water scarcity, economic and financial aspects 
requirements for sustainable water systems 
fundamentals of treatment and process design 
industrial water use and wastewater treatment 
sustainable effluent disposal 
sustainable construction principles  
With integrated theory, design and operation specifications for each treatment process, this book addresses the extent to which various treatment methods work in theory as well as how cost effective they are in practice. It provides a nontechnical guide on how to recover and reuse water from effluent, which is suitable for those in water resource management, environmental planning, civil and chemical engineering.

Combining theory and practice from the developing and developed worlds with high- and low-tech, high- and low-cost solutions, this book discusses fundamental and advanced aspects of water engineering and includes:
 
 
 
water resource issues including climate change, water scarcity, economic and financial aspects 
requirements for sustainable water systems 
fundamentals of treatment and process design 
industrial water use and wastewater treatment 
sustainable effluent disposal 
sustainable construction principles  
With integrated theory, design and operation specifications for each treatment process, this book addresses the extent to which various treatment methods work in theory as well as how cost effective they are in practice. It provides a nontechnical guide on how to recover and reuse water from effluent, which is suitable for those in water resource management, environmental planning, civil and chemical engineering.

T1  - Numerous new mitogenomic sequences and multiple new environmental DNA markers for invasive bighead and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and H. molitrix) populations in North America
AN  - 2070370613
AB  - Invasive Asian bighead and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis and H. molitrix) pose a substantial threat to North American waterways. Recently, environmental DNA (eDNA), the use of species-specific genetic assays to detect the DNA of a particular species in a water sample, has gained recognition as a tool for tracking the invasion front of these species toward the Great Lakes. The goal of this study was to develop new species-specific conventional PCR (cPCR) and quantitative (qPCR) markers for detection of these species in North American waterways. We first generated complete mitochondrial genome sequences from 33 bighead and 29 silver carp individuals collected throughout their introduced range. These sequences were aligned with other common and closely related species to identify potential eDNA markers. We then field-tested these genetic markers for species-specificity and sensitivity in environmental samples. Newly developed markers performed well in field trials, had low false positive rates and had comparable sensitivity compared to current markers. The new markers developed in this study greatly expand the number of species-specific genetic markers available to track the invasion front of bighead and silver carp, and can be used to improve the resolution of these assays. Additionally, the use of the qPCR markers developed in this study may reduce sample processing time and cost of eDNA monitoring for these species.

T1  - Social Predation:&nbsp;How Group Living Benefits Predators and Prey
AN  - 2133873509
AB  - The classic literature on predation dealt almost exclusively with solitary predators and their prey. Going back to Lotka-Volterra and optimal foraging theory, the theory about predation, including predator-prey population dynamics, was developed for solitary species. Various consequences of sociality for predators have been considered only recently. Similarly, while it was long recognized that prey species can benefit from living in groups, research on the adaptive value of sociality for prey species mostly emerged in the 1970s. The main theme of this book is the various ways that predators and prey may benefit from living in groups. The first part focusses on predators and explores how group membership influences predation success rate, from searching to subduing prey. The second part focusses on how prey in groups can detect and escape predators. The final section explores group size and composition and how individuals respond over evolutionary times to the challenges posed by chasing or being chased by animals in groups. This book will help the reader understand current issues in social predation theory and provide a synthesis of the literature across a broad range of animal taxa. 
Includes the whole taxonomical range rather than limiting it to a select fewFeatures in-depth analysis that allows a better understanding of many subtleties surrounding the issues related to social predationPresents both models and empirical results while covering the extensive predator and prey literatureContains extensive illustrations and separate boxes that cover more technical features, i.e., to present models and review results

T1  - Toxicity of differently sized and coated silver nanoparticles to the bacterium Pseudomonas putida
AN  - 1960995392
AB  - Aim of this study was to describe the toxicity of a set of different commercially available silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to the gram-negative bacterium Pseudomonas putida (growth inhibition assay, ISO 10712) in order to contribute to their environmental hazard and risk assessment. Different AgNP sizes and coatings were selected in order to analyze whether those characteristics are determinants of nanoparticle toxicity. Silver nitrate was tested for comparison. In general Pseudomonas putida reacted very sensitive towards the exposure to silver, with an EC 05  value of 0.043 µ g L-1 for AgNO 3  and between 0.13 and 3.41 µ g L-1 for the different AgNPs (EC 50  values 0.16 µ g L-1 for AgNO3, resp. between 0.25 and 13.5 µ g L-1 for AgNPs). As the ionic form of silver is clearly the most toxic, an environmental hazard assessment for microorganisms based on total silver concentration and the assumption that AgNPs dissolve is sufficiently protective. Neither specific coatings nor certain sizes could be linked to increasing or decreasing toxicity. The characterization of particle behavior as well as the total and dissolved silver content in the medium during the exposures was not possible due to the high sensitivity of Pseudomonas (test concentrations were below detection limits), indicating the need for further development in the analytical domain. Monitored silver concentrations in the aquatic environment span six orders of magnitude (0.1 – 120000 ng L-1 ), which falls into the span of observed EC 05  values and might hence indicate a risk to environmental bacteria.

T1  - Living Waters:&nbsp;Ecology of Animals in Swamps, Rivers, Lakes and Dams
AN  - 2141073824
AB  - Wetlands are often seen as the ultimate symbol of beauty and tranquillity, their clear waters sheltering mysterious animals in a world where change is gentle and slow, from dragonflies skimming above their own reflections to the fishes glimpsed briefly below. Yet Australian wetlands are among the most varied and changeable habitats found anywhere, and the many creatures that live out their lives in and around water are superbly adapted to some of the most unpredictable ecosystems in the world.This book follows the diverse common themes and patterns that link inland waters from Tasmania to the tropics. It shows how cycles of change, the ways that different wetland animals travel through and between wetlands, and the interactions of the animals themselves create an ever-changing ecological kaleidoscope. Drawing on what is known of the biology, ecology and even the genetics of many of the most abundant, widespread and successful groups of animals, the author shows similarities to wetlands in other parts of the world, as well as some of the more extreme environments and specialised animals that are unique to this continent. Far more than a natural history, Living Waters explains the underlying forces that drive ecological change and movement in Australian wetlands, from the particular needs and habits of some specialised waterbirds to swarms of dragonflies and damselflies that may flourish for a few months before disappearing for years, and fishes found gasping in drying pools far from the nearest permanent water just hours after a desert deluge.

T1  - Ecology of Australian Temperate Reefs:&nbsp;The Unique South
AN  - 2135227729
AB  - Ecology of Australian Temperate Reefs presents the current state of knowledge of the ecology of important elements of southern Australian sub-tidal reef flora and fauna, and the underlying ecological principles. Preliminary chapters describe the geological origin, oceanography and biogeography of southern Australia, including the transitional temperate regions toward the Abrolhos Islands in the west and to Sydney in the east. The book then explains the origin and evolution of the flora and fauna at geological time scales as Australia separated from Antarctica; the oceanography of the region, including principal currents, and interactions with on-shelf waters; and the ecology of particular species or species groups at different trophic levels, starting with algae, then the ecological principles on which communities are organised. Finally, conservation and management issues are discussed.Ecology of Australian Temperate Reefs is well illustrated with line drawings, figures and colour photographs showing the many species covered, and will be a much valued reference for biologists, undergraduates, and those interested and concerned with reef life and its natural history.

T1  - A linkage map of transcribed single nucleotide polymorphisms in rohu (Labeo rohita ) and QTL associated with resistance to Aeromonas hydrophila
AN  - 1562522711
AB  - Doc number: 541              Abstract              Background: Production of carp dominates world aquaculture. More than 1.1 million tonnes of rohu carp, Labeo rohita  (Hamilton), were produced in 2010. Aeromonas hydrophila  is a bacterial pathogen causing aeromoniasis in rohu, and is a major problem for carp production worldwide. There is a need to better understand the genetic mechanisms affecting resistance to this disease, and to develop tools that can be used with selective breeding to improve resistance. Here we use a 6 K SNP array to genotype 21 full-sibling families of L. rohita  that were experimentally challenged intra-peritoneally with a virulent strain of A. hydrophila  to scan the genome for quantitative trait loci associated with disease resistance.              Results: In all, 3193 SNPs were found to be informative and were used to create a linkage map and to scan for QTL affecting resistance to A. hydrophila . The linkage map consisted of 25 linkage groups, corresponding to the number of haploid chromosomes in L. rohita . Male and female linkage maps were similar in terms of order, coverage (1384 and 1393 cM, respectively) and average interval distances (1.32 and 1.35 cM, respectively). Forty-one percent of the SNPs were annotated with gene identity using BLAST (cut off E-score of 0.001). Twenty-one SNPs mapping to ten linkage groups showed significant associations with the traits hours of survival  and dead or alive  (P  <0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Of the SNPs showing significant or suggestive associations with the traits, several were homologous to genes of known immune function or were in close linkage to such genes. Genes of interest included heat shock proteins (70, 60, 105 and "small heat shock proteins"), mucin (5b precursor and 2), lectin (receptor and CD22), tributyltin-binding protein, major histocompatibility loci (I and II), complement protein component c7-1, perforin 1, ubiquitin (ligase, factor e4b isoform 2 and conjugation enzyme e2 c), proteasome subunit, T-cell antigen receptor and lymphocyte specific protein tyrosine kinase.              Conclusions: A panel of markers has been identified that will be validated for use with both genomic and marker-assisted selection to improve resistance of L. rohita  to A. hydrophila .

T1  - Palladium Nanoparticles Induce Disturbances in Cell Cycle Entry and Progression of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells: Paramount Role of Ions
AN  - 1552701709
AB  - There is concern about the possible toxicity of palladium nanoparticles (Pd-NP), as they are released in the environment through many applications. We previously studied the toxicity of Pd-NP at high concentrations; here we address the possible toxicity of Pd-NP at low, subtoxic doses. In particular, we have exposed normal human PBMC entering into the first in vitro mitotic division to Pd-NP and to Pd(IV) ions to evaluate ROS generation and cell cycle progression. We have measured a statistically significant increase of intracellular ROS in Pd(IV) exposed cells, but not in Pd-NP exposed cells. TEM revealed accumulation of lipid droplets and autophagic and mitophagic vacuoles, which appeared more conspicuous in cells exposed to Pd(IV) ions than to Pd-NP. Pd-NP were visible in the cytoplasm of Pd-NP exposed cells. Pd-NP addition was associated with a significant increase of cells within the G0/G1-phase and a significant reduction in GS- and G2/M-phases. Cells exposed to Pd(IV) ions showed a significant amplification of these cell cycle alterations. These results suggest that ions, per se or released by NPs, are the true inducers of Pd toxicity. It will be essential to verify whether the observed disturbance represents a temporary response or might result in permanent alterations.

AB  - Several Dinophysis species produce diarrhoetic toxins (okadaic acid and dinophysistoxins) and pectenotoxins, and cause gastointestinal illness, Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP), even at low cell densities (<103 cells*L-1). They are the main threat, in terms of days of harvesting bans, to aquaculture in Northern Japan, Chile, and Europe. Toxicity and toxin profiles are very variable, more between strains than species. The distribution of DSP events mirrors that of shellfish production areas that have implemented toxin regulations, otherwise misinterpreted as bacterial or viral contamination. Field observations and laboratory experiments have shown that most of the toxins produced by Dinophysis are released into the medium, raising questions about the ecological role of extracelular toxins and their potential uptake by shellfish. Shellfish contamination results from a complex balance between food selection, adsorption, species-specific enzymatic transformations, and allometric processes. Highest risk areas are those combining Dinophysis strains with high cell content of okadaates, aquaculture with predominance of mytilids (good accumulators of toxins), and consumers who frequently include mussels in their diet. Regions including pectenotoxins in their regulated phycotoxins will suffer from much longer harvesting bans and from disloyal competition with production areas where these toxins have been deregulated.

T1  - Assessment of toxicity of monocrotophos in freshwater bivalve, Lamellidens marginalis, using different markers
AN  - 1514833854
AB  - The present study was undertaken to evaluate the toxic effects of monocrotophos, a widely used organophosphorus pesticide, on Lamellidens marginalis with a wide battery of biomarkers consisting of AchE inhibition, lipid peroxidation, the levels of antioxidant enzymes, and histopathological changes. Animals were exposed to monocrotophos (52.36 mg/l) for four days. Malondialdehyde (MDA) values were measured as index of oxidation while Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione s-Transferase (GST), and Glutathione-Reductase (GR) were measured as index of an antioxidant status. After exposure, a significant reduction of the capability to neutralize radicals was observed. Histopathological changes, such as fibrosis in gill filaments and hypertrophy in mucous cells of foot tissue, were observed after treatment.In a second series of experiment, exposed animals were thereafter transferred to clean water and kept in it up to 28 days to assess the recovery pattern. Significant recovery is observed in AchE and antioxidant enzymes. Oxidative damage observed after acute exposure indicate that mussels faced an oxidative challenge but were able to counteract, as values of anti-oxidants returned near to control values after 28 days. Altered activities in anti-oxidant enzymes due to stress recovered well after 28 days in gill and muscles as compared to foot and mantle. Overall results suggested that oxidative markers are highly sensitive and could be profitably applied to freshwater mussels for environmental quality assessment in freshwater.

T1  - Bioaccumulation, Bioamplification des Polluants Dans la Faune Terrestre:&nbsp;Un Outil Pour la Biosurveillancedes écosystèmes
AN  - 2135782761
AB  - La biosurveillance des écosystèmes doit reposer non seulement sur le suivi des populations (structure et dynamique) mais aussi sur la connaissance de leurs niveaux de contamination. Cependant, la prise en compte de la bioaccumulation des contaminants dans les organismes se heurte à la complexité des processus biologiques impliqués, variables selon les espèces, les milieux et les substances chimiques considérés ce qui explique le faible nombre de modèles de transfert disponibles. Par ailleurs, la difficulté technique d'analyser les contaminants persistants et bioaccumulatifs dans les tissus limite également l'intégration de la bioaccumulation dans les programmes de biosurveillance alors même que cette mesure permettrait de caractériser leur devenir, leur biodisponibilité et parfois d'expliquer leurs effets toxiques.
 Cet ouvrage est une revue des données sur la bioaccumulation des contaminants de l'environnement chez les invertébrés (nématodes, annélides, mollusques, arthropodes) et chez les vertébrés (reptiles, oiseaux, mammifères). L'intérêt de ces données pour l'évaluation du risque écologique, de même que divers modèles d'étude des transferts dans les chaînes trophiques et les relations entre bioaccumulation et effets toxiques sont présentés. Des recommandations pour une meilleure prise en compte de l'analyse de la bioaccumulation en évaluation des risques sont proposées.
 Ce livre s'adresse aux personnes et organisations publiques ou privées impliquées dans la surveillance des milieux naturels, dans l'évaluation des risques environnementaux des substances chimiques. Il s'adresse également aux chercheurs, enseignants, et étudiants des filières s'intéressant aux problèmes de l'environnement impliquant des contaminations chimiques. Fruit du travail d'enseignants-chercheurs en écotoxicologie de l'université de Franche-Comté (A. de Vaufleury, F. Gimbert), cet ouvrage a été réalisé avec l'appui d'un zoologiste (L. Gomot) en interaction avec des experts-sols de l'ADEME (I. Feix et A.Bispo).

T1  - Cormorant Catch Concerns for Fishers: Estimating the Size-Selectivity of a Piscivorous Bird
AN  - 1449332489
AB  - Conflict arises in fisheries worldwide when piscivorous birds target fish species of commercial value. This paper presents a method for estimating size selectivity functions for piscivores and uses it to compare predation selectivities of Great Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis L. 1758) with that of gill-net fishing on a European perch (Perca fluviatilis L. 1758) population in the Curonian Lagoon, Lithuania. Fishers often regard cormorants as an unwanted “satellite species”, but the degree of direct competition and overlap in size-specific selectivity between fishers and cormorants is unknown. This study showed negligible overlap in selectivity between Great Cormorants and legal-sized commercial nets. The selectivity estimation method has general application potential for use in conjunction with population dynamics models to assess fish population responses to size-selective fishing from a wide range of piscivorous predators.

T1  - Environmental Economics and Natural Resource Management
AN  - 2131916047
AB  - The tools of environmental economics guide policymakers as they weigh development against nature, present against future, and certain benefits against uncertain consequences. From reluctant-but-necessary calculations of the value of life, to quandaries over profits at the environment's expense, the policies and research findings explained in this textbook are relevant to decisions made daily by individuals, firms, and governments. The fourth edition of Environmental Economics and Natural Resource Management pairs the user-friendly approaches of the previous editions with the latest developments in the field. A story-based narrative delivers clear, concise coverage of contemporary policy initiatives. To promote environmental and economic literacy, we have added even more visual aids, including color photographs and diagrams unmatched in other texts. Ancillaries include an Instructor's Guide with answers to all of the practice problems and downloadable slides of figures and tables from the book. The economy is a subset of the environment, from which resources are obtained, workers and consumers receive sustenance, and life begins. Energy prices and environmental calamities constrain economic growth and the quality of life. The same can be said about overly restrictive environmental policies. It is with an appreciation for the weighty influence of this discipline, and the importance of conveying it to students, that this textbook is crafted.

T1  - Contrasting Food Web Factor and Body Size Relationships with Hg and Se Concentrations in Marine Biota
AN  - 1429688142
AB  - Marine fish and shellfish are primary sources of human exposure to mercury, a potentially toxic metal, and selenium, an essential element that may protect against mercury bioaccumulation and toxicity. Yet we lack a thorough understanding of Hg and Se patterns in common marine taxa, particularly those that are commercially important, and how food web and body size factors differ in their influence on Hg and Se patterns. We compared Hg and Se content among marine fish and invertebrate taxa collected from Long Island, NY, and examined associations between Hg, Se, body length, trophic level (measured by δ15N) and degree of pelagic feeding (measured by δ13C). Finfish, particularly shark, had high Hg content whereas bivalves generally had high Se content. Both taxonomic differences and variability were larger for Hg than Se, and Hg content explained most of the variation in Hg:Se molar ratios among taxa. Finally, Hg was more strongly associated with length and trophic level across taxa than Se, consistent with a greater degree of Hg bioaccumulation in the body over time, and biomagnification through the food web, respectively. Overall, our findings indicate distinct taxonomic and ecological Hg and Se patterns in commercially important marine biota, and these patterns have nutritional and toxicological implications for seafood-consuming wildlife and humans.

T1  - The Hydropolitics of Dams:&nbsp;Engineering or Ecosystems?
AN  - 2131113382
AB  - A fascinating examination of the benefits and downsides of large dams, this book explores the political, economic and environmental impact and importance of water management policy practised across the world.Dr Mark Everard's work in all four sectors of society - private, public, academic and voluntary - has taken him across five continents to undertake applied research, policy development and capacity-building relating to the ways in which people connect with ecosystems. The author of twelve other books, including Common Ground (Zed Books, 2011), over sixty peer-reviewed scientific papers and over two hundred technical magazine articles, Mark is also a communicator on sustainability and wider aquatic matters on TV and radio. He has served on numerous government advisory and expert groups in the UK, as well as advising other governments and multinational corporations on sustainability matters. His specialty is on the water environment, land uses across the catchments that influence it, the pressures that people impose upon it and the many often unrecognised benefits that they derive from it. Mark's work includes environmental ethics and economics as a means to bring our intimate interdependencies with ecosystems into the mainstream of public awareness and government thinking.

T1  - Global Environmental Politics
AN  - 2131274247
AB  - Although discussions about the global environment are now a daily occurrence—from companies touting energy-saving products to politicians debating how to best address the issue of climate change and other environmental concerns—it remains a topic plagued by misinformation and ideologically skewed arguments. For more than twenty years, Global Environmental Politics has provided an up-to-date, accurate, and unbiased introduction to the world’s most pressing environmental issues, and this new edition continues the tradition. With new material on the latest international environmental regimes, the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development, the challenges of regime implementation, and the impact of the global economic crises on the global environment, the authors offer a comprehensive overview of the environment and international politics. It is vital reading for anyone wishing to understand the current state of the field and to make informed decisions about which policies might best safeguard our environment for the future.

T1  - Insect Molecular Genetics:&nbsp;An Introduction to Principles and Applications
AN  - 2131151906
AB  - "Insect Molecular Genetics, Third Edition," summarizes and synthesizes two rather disparate disciplinesOCoentomology and molecular genetics. This volume provides an introduction to the techniques and literature of molecular genetics; defines terminology; and reviews concepts, principles, and applications of these powerful tools. The world of insect molecular genetics, once dominated by "Drosophila," has become much more diverse, especially with the sequencing of multiple arthropod genomes (from spider mites to mosquitoes). This introduction includes discussion of honey bees, mosquitoes, flour beetles, silk moths, fruit flies, aphids, house flies, kissing bugs, cicadas, butterflies, tsetse flies and armyworms. 
This book serves as both a foundational text and a review of a rapidly growing literature. With fully revised and updated chapters, the third edition will be a valuable addition to the personal libraries of entomologists, geneticists, and molecular biologists. 
* Up-to-date references to important review articles, websites, and seminal citations in the disciplines
* Well crafted and instructive illustrations integral to explaining the techniques of molecular genetics
* Glossary of terms to help beginners learn the vocabulary of molecular biology"

T1  - Handbook of Microalgal Culture:&nbsp;Applied Phycology and Biotechnology
AN  - 2131910054
AB  - Algae are some of the fastest growing organisms in the world, with up to 90% of their weight made up from carbohydrate, protein and oil. As well as these macromolecules, microalgae are also rich in other high-value compounds, such as vitamins, pigments, and biologically active compounds, All these compounds can be extracted for use by the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and food industries, and the algae itself can be used for feeding of livestock, in particular fish, where on-going research is dedicated to increasing the percentage of fish and shellfish feed not derived from fish meal. Microalgae are also applied to wastewater bioremediation and carbon capture from industrial flue gases, and can be used as organic fertilizer.  
So far, only a few species of microalgae, including cyanobacteria, are under mass cultivation. The potential for expansion is enormous, considering the existing hundreds of thousands of species and subspecies, in which a large gene-pool offers a significant potential for many new producers. 
Completely revised, updated and expanded, and with the inclusion of new Editor, Qiang Hu of Arizona State University, the second edition of this extremely important book contains 37 chapters. Nineteen of these chapters are written by new authors, introducing many advanced and emerging technologies and applications such as novel photobioreactors, mass cultivation of oil-bearing microalgae for biofuels, exploration of naturally occurring and genetically engineered microalgae as cell factories for high-value chemicals, and techno-economic analysis of microalgal mass culture. This excellent new edition also contains details of the biology and large-scale culture of several economically important and newly-exploited microalgae, including 
Botryococcus, 
Chlamydomonas, Nannochloropsis, 
Nostoc, 
Chlorella, Spirulina,

Algae are some of the fastest growing organisms in the world, with up to 90% of their weight made up from carbohydrate, protein and oil. As well as these macromolecules, microalgae are also rich in other high-value compounds, such as vitamins, pigments, and biologically active compounds, All these compounds can be extracted for use by the cosmetics, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and food industries, and the algae itself can be used for feeding of livestock, in particular fish, where on-going research is dedicated to increasing the percentage of fish and shellfish feed not derived from fish meal. Microalgae are also applied to wastewater bioremediation and carbon capture from industrial flue gases, and can be used as organic fertilizer.  
So far, only a few species of microalgae, including cyanobacteria, are under mass cultivation. The potential for expansion is enormous, considering the existing hundreds of thousands of species and subspecies, in which a large gene-pool offers a significant potential for many new producers. 
Completely revised, updated and expanded, and with the inclusion of new Editor, Qiang Hu of Arizona State University, the second edition of this extremely important book contains 37 chapters. Nineteen of these chapters are written by new authors, introducing many advanced and emerging technologies and applications such as novel photobioreactors, mass cultivation of oil-bearing microalgae for biofuels, exploration of naturally occurring and genetically engineered microalgae as cell factories for high-value chemicals, and techno-economic analysis of microalgal mass culture. This excellent new edition also contains details of the biology and large-scale culture of several economically important and newly-exploited microalgae, including 
Botryococcus, 
Chlamydomonas, Nannochloropsis, 
Nostoc, 
Chlorella, Spirulina, 
Haematococcus, and 
Dunaniella species/strains.

T1  - Reduction of zooplankton communities in small lake outlets in relation to abiotic and biotic factors
AN  - 1367463581
AB  - The aim of this study was to answer the following questions: (1) which environmental variables, biotic (fish predation) or abiotic factors, have a greater influence on the rate of zooplankton changes in lake outlet sections and (2) which plankters suffer the greatest reduction in the outlet section.              Samples were collected in two locations at each of 18 lakes. The first site was right at the outflow; the second site was 0.2 km downstream from the outflow. At downstream sites the percentage contribution of Rotifera in zooplankton species number and abundance was higher than in the outflow, whilst the percentage contribution of Cladocera and Copepoda (except nauplii) in the zooplankton species number and abundance was lower at downstream sites than in outlets. The most important variables affecting the rate of zooplankton reduction in the lake outlets are the biomass of cyprinids and hydrological parameters along the outlet, such as discharge, current velocity, and depth.              The most dramatic reductions involved daphnids, adult copepods, small cladocerans, and copepodites, while the reduction in the abundance of rotifers and nauplii was statistically insignificant.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Biogeography and Biodiversity of Western Atlantic Mollusks
AN  - 2141017265
AB  - Detailing three marine molluscan faunal provinces (Carolinian, Caribbean, and Brazilian), this volume examines the distribution and evolutionary patterns of the marine mollusks of the tropical and subtropical regions of the western Atlantic Ocean. It also covers the paleobiogeography of the tropical Americas, discussing the ancestral biogeographical regions that gave rise to the recent provincial and subprovincial arrangements. These biogeographical patterns are essential for understanding the evolution of modern continental shelf marine faunas, as they reflect the environmental and climatological histories of the entire oceanic basin. The book's color plates make it a highly desirable resource for marine biologists and malacologists.

T1  - Metabolism of 2-Chloro-4-Nitroaniline via Novel Aerobic Degradation Pathway by Rhodococcus sp. Strain MB-P1
AN  - 1344056913
AB  - 2-chloro-4-nitroaniline (2-C-4-NA) is used as an intermediate in the manufacture of dyes, pharmaceuticals, corrosion inhibitor and also used in the synthesis of niclosamide, a molluscicide. It is marked as a black-listed substance due to its poor biodegradability. We report biodegradation of 2-C-4-NA and its pathway characterization by Rhodococcus sp. strain MB-P1 under aerobic conditions. The strain MB-P1 utilizes 2-C-4-NA as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source. In the growth medium, the degradation of 2-C-4-NA occurs with the release of nitrite ions, chloride ions, and ammonia. During the resting cell studies, the 2-C-4-NA-induced cells of strain MB-P1 transformed 2-C-4-NA stoichiometrically to 4-amino-3-chlorophenol (4-A-3-CP), which subsequently gets transformed to 6-chlorohydroxyquinol (6-CHQ) metabolite. Enzyme assays by cell-free lysates prepared from 2-C-4-NA-induced MB-P1 cells, demonstrated that the first enzyme in the 2-C-4-NA degradation pathway is a flavin-dependent monooxygenase that catalyzes the stoichiometric removal of nitro group and production of 4-A-3-CP. Oxygen uptake studies on 4-A-3-CP and related anilines by 2-C-4-NA-induced MB-P1 cells demonstrated the involvement of aniline dioxygenase in the second step of 2-C-4-NA degradation. This is the first report showing 2-C-4-NA degradation and elucidation of corresponding metabolic pathway by an aerobic bacterium.

T1  - Population Dynamics P System (PDP) Models: A Standardized Protocol for Describing and Applying Novel Bio-Inspired Computing Tools
AN  - 1330895049
AB  - Today, the volume of data and knowledge of processes necessitates more complex models that integrate all available information. This handicap has been solved thanks to the technological advances in both software and hardware. Computational tools available today have allowed developing a new family of models, known as computational models. The description of these models is difficult as they can not be expressed analytically, and it is therefore necessary to create protocols that serve as guidelines for future users. The Population Dynamics P systems models (PDP) are a novel and effective computational tool to model complex problems, are characterized by the ability to work in parallel (simultaneously interrelating different processes), are modular and have a high computational efficiency. However, the difficulty of describing these models therefore requires a protocol to unify the presentation and the steps to follow. We use two case studies to demonstrate the use and implementation of these computational models for population dynamics and ecological process studies, discussing briefly their potential applicability to simulate complex ecosystem dynamics.

T1  - Endocrine Disrupters:&nbsp;Hazard Testing and Assessment Methods
AN  - 2130854201
AB  - Enables researchers to assess the effects of endocrine disrupters as well as comply with new environmental regulations 
Endocrine disrupters are chemicals--both man-made and natural--that interfere with the body's endocrine system, potentially resulting in adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effects. In recent years, a number of regulatory authorities around the world have drafted or enacted legislation that requires the detection and assessment of the effects of endocrine disrupters on both humans and wildlife. In response, this book provides comprehensive, up-to-date information on the latest tested and proven methods used to detect and assess the environmental hazards posed by endocrine-disrupting chemicals. 

Endocrine Disrupters is divided into chapters covering each major taxon as well as chapters dedicated to hazard assessment and regulation. The book covers testing methods for all the vertebrate groups and several invertebrate phyla, including: 
 
Crustaceans and mollusks 
Insects 
Fish 
Amphibians and reptiles 
Birds and mammals  
Moreover, the book emphasizes practical, ethical testing methods that combine sensitivity, efficiency, statistical power, and reasonable cost. 
Each chapter is written by one or more international experts in ecotoxicology, offering readers step-by-step guidance for implementing each method based on the latest research and the authors' firsthand laboratory experience. Furthermore, all the chapters have been subjected to a rigorous peer review and edited in light of the reviewers' comments. References at the end of each chapter guide readers to the literature in the field. 

Endocrine Disrupters is recommended for scientists who need to test chemicals for possible endocrine-disrupting properties. It is also recommended for regulatory authorities who need to decide whether particular chemicals can be safely marketed.

Each chapter is written by one or more international experts in ecotoxicology, offering readers step-by-step guidance for implementing each method based on the latest research and the authors' firsthand laboratory experience. Furthermore, all the chapters have been subjected to a rigorous peer review and edited in light of the reviewers' comments. References at the end of each chapter guide readers to the literature in the field. 

Endocrine Disrupters is recommended for scientists who need to test chemicals for possible endocrine-disrupting properties. It is also recommended for regulatory authorities who need to decide whether particular chemicals can be safely marketed.

PETER MATTHIESSEN, PhD, is an aquatic ecotoxicologist who works as an independent consultant. Specializing in the study of endocrine disrupters, he has conducted extensive research into how sewage effluents cause feminization in wild male fish as well as how tributyltin-based antifoulants cause masculinization in wild female mollusks. Professor Matthiessen is a member of the UK Advisory Committee on Pesticides and Co-chair of the OECD Validation Management Group for Ecotoxicity Tests. He has contributed to the development of standardized ecotoxicity assays with sensitivity for endocrine disrupters as well as written guidance for the interpretation of the resulting data.

T1  - Wild Ohio:&nbsp;The Best of Our Natural Heritage
AN  - 2148342170
AB  - A photographic documentation of the most outstanding natural habitats in Ohio “We hope this book never becomes an epitaph for what once was. Ohio is incredibly rich in biodiversity, possibly more so than any other midwestern state. . . . We encourage you to visit these places and view the greatest natural resources that Ohio has to offer.”—from the Preface While Ohio has lost much of its presettlement landscape, many nearly pristine habitats remain. These relics are populated by a fascinating array of flora and fauna. Wild Ohio singles out the best of Ohio’s natural lands and documents their importance in words and photographs. Because the state has lost over 90 percent of its wetlands and over 99 percent of its original prairie, Wild Ohio focuses especially on rare and declining animals and plants with the intention of inspiring a love of nature and an interest in conservation. The authors feature approximately forty sites, encompassing nearly every type of habitat found in the state and representing all regions of Ohio. Naturalist Jim McCormac’s descriptive text provides an overview of each site and tips for visitors. Gary Meszaros’s stunning photographs highlight the visual beauty of each area’s flora, fauna, and landscape. Every section includes a description of the physiographic province and a map of the sites. A celebration of what still remains and a reminder of what has been lost, Wild Ohio will be appreciated by anyone with an interest in Ohio’s natural history and landscape.

Volume 1 spans several disciplines--Civil and Environmental Engineering, Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, and Industrial Engineering--and covers: 
 
New Measurement Techniques in Structural Health Monitoring 
Traffic Congestion Management 
Measurements in Environmental Engineering 
Dimensions, Surfaces, and Their Measurement 
Luminescent Method for Pressure Measurement 
Vibration Measurement 
Temperature Measurement 
Force Measurement

T1  - Invasive fish fines will bite wallet
AN  - 1266499285
AB  - The B.C. government has amended its controlled alien species regulation to impose steep fines for releasing invasive fish such as the snakehead, a Chinese import with a voracious appetite and the ability to wiggle across land to get to new waterways. 

              
The regulations also prohibit possession and breeding of identified high-risk aquatic species. They expand the reach of legislation passed in 2009 that restricted ownership and breeding of tigers, snakes, crocodiles and a long list of other exotic animals. Added to the list are species of monitor lizard that grow to more than two metres long or otherwise represent a threat to public safety.

T1  - Reduction of zooplankton communities in small lake outlets in relation to abiotic and biotic factors
AN  - 2811704968
AB  - The aim of this study was to answer the following questions: (1) which environmental variables, biotic (fish predation) or abiotic factors, have a greater influence on the rate of zooplankton changes in lake outlet sections and (2) which plankters suffer the greatest reduction in the outlet section.Samples were collected in two locations at each of 18 lakes. The first site was right at the outflow; the second site was 0.2 km downstream from the outflow. At downstream sites the percentage contribution of Rotifera in zooplankton species number and abundance was higher than in the outflow, whilst the percentage contribution of Cladocera and Copepoda (except nauplii) in the zooplankton species number and abundance was lower at downstream sites than in outlets. The most important variables affecting the rate of zooplankton reduction in the lake outlets are the biomass of cyprinids and hydrological parameters along the outlet, such as discharge, current velocity, and depth.The most dramatic reductions involved daphnids, adult copepods, small cladocerans, and copepodites, while the reduction in the abundance of rotifers and nauplii was statistically insignificant.

T1  - Trace Fossils As Indicators of Sedimentary Environments
AN  - 2134960509
AB  - Integration of ichnological information into sedimentological models, and vice versa, is one of the main means by which we can improve our understanding of ancient depositional environments. Mainly intended for sedimentologists, this book aims to make ichnological methods as part of facies interpretation more popular, providing an analytical review of the ichnology of all major depositional environments and the use of ichnology in biostratigraphic and sequence stratigraphic analysis. 
It starts with an introduction to the historical aspect of ichnology, introducing common concepts and methods, and then continues with parts treating the main depositional systems from continental, shallow-marine and deep-marine siliciclastics, and marine carbonates. The last part is dedicated to the ichnology in hydrocarbon reservoir and aquifer characterization. 
 
First overview in 25 years of the status of ichnological studies in facies reconstructions of all major depositional environments 
Written by a selected, well-experienced and specialized international authorship

T1  - Wine Tourism in the Temecula Valley: Neoliberal Development Policies and Their Contradictions
AN  - 1768216705
AB  - Wine tourism is a growing phenomenon, with tourists enjoying not only wine but a rural lifestyle that is associated with winegrowing areas and the elusive essence of terroir. The Temecula Valley in southern California, a small wine-producing region and wine tourism destination, is experiencing state-led plans for a vast expansion of production and tourism capacity. This article traces the challenges inherent in this development process, and questions the sustainability of such plans regarding the very environment the wine tourists seek out, especially regarding the availability of natural resources, mainly water, needed to fulfil these plans. The article concludes with a call for an applied anthropology of policy that is centred on the articulations of the state and neoliberal capitalism.

T1  - Pyrosequencing of Haliotis diversicolor Transcriptomes: Insights into Early Developmental Molluscan Gene Expression
AN  - 1339064797
AB  - Background The abalone Haliotis diversicolor is a good model for study of the settlement and metamorphosis, which are widespread marine ecological phenomena. However, information on the global gene backgrounds and gene expression profiles for the early development of abalones is lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, eight non-normalized and multiplex barcode-labeled transcriptomes were sequenced using a 454 GS system to cover the early developmental stages of the abalone H. diversicolor. The assembly generated 35,415 unigenes, of which 7,566 were assigned GO terms. A global gene expression profile containing 636 scaffolds/contigs was constructed and was proven reliable using qPCR evaluation. It indicated that there may be existing dramatic phase transitions. Bioprocesses were proposed, including the ‘lock system’ in mature eggs, the collagen shells of the trochophore larvae and the development of chambered extracellular matrix (ECM) structures within the earliest postlarvae. Conclusion This study globally details the first 454 sequencing data for larval stages of H. diversicolor. A basic analysis of the larval transcriptomes and cluster of the gene expression profile indicates that each stage possesses a batch of specific genes that are indispensable during embryonic development, especially during the two-cell, trochophore and early postlarval stages. These data will provide a fundamental resource for future physiological works on abalones, revealing the mechanisms of settlement and metamorphosis at the molecular level.

T1  - The Freshwater Fishes of Suriname
AN  - 2131073894
AB  - With some 480 currently known fresh- and brackish-water fish species, Suriname has a rich inland fish fauna that is related to the most diverse freshwater fish fauna on planet Earth, i.e. that of the Amazon River. Interest in the freshwater fishes of Suriname by naturalists and scientists extends back over more than two centuries. Suriname is undoubtedly the site of origin of the oldest extant preserved specimens of South American fishes and 19 Surinamese fish species were described and figured by Linnaeus. Building on ichthyological studies initiated in the 1960s by the Brokopondo Project, this book provides an introduction to the freshwater fish fauna of Suriname, including identification keys, photographs of the species and descriptions of their habitats, that should be especially useful to decision makers, conservation biologists, aquarium hobbyists and eco-tourists.

T1  - Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning:&nbsp;Frameworks, Methodologies, and Integration
AN  - 2131067650
AB  - The biological composition and richness of most of the Earth's major ecosystems are being dramatically and irreversibly transformed by anthropogenic activity. Yet, despite the vast areal extent of our oceans, the mainstay of research to-date in the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning arena has been weighted towards ecological observations and experimentation in terrestrial plant and soil systems. This book provides a framework for extending these concepts to a variety of marinesystems.Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning is the first book to address the latest advances in biodiversity-function science using marine examples. It brings together contributions from the leading scientists in the field to provide an in-depth evaluation of the science, before offering a perspective on future research directions for some of the most pressing environmental issues facing society today and in the future.

T1  - Northern Pike:&nbsp;Ecology, Conservation, and Management History
AN  - 2131977936
AB  - The northern pike--sometimes affectionately known as the "aquatic wolf"--is one of the most sought after and mythologized fishes in Minnesota, but until now there have been few books devoted to the history and ecological management of the species. Based on pioneering research carried out in Minnesota by leading pike specialist Rodney B. Pierce, Northern Pike Ecology, Conservation, and Management History is the most complete collection of information to date on the species, for everyone from scientists and conservation biologists to general readers and recreational anglers. A tremendously important game fish and resource both in Minnesota and throughout the northern hemisphere, northern pike populations directly reflect local geology and human influence, playing a key role in the health of freshwater ecosystems. As urbanization spreads and the human population continues to grow, pike populations face increasing pressure, requiring new ways of looking at and managing the species. In Minnesota, groundbreaking work has been conducted on northern pike: analyses of stocking success and investigations into the relationships within fish communities, the management of rearing marshes, environmental effects on natural production, the genetics of northern pike, and strategies for scientifically monitoring pike. The state has been a leader in developing fishing regulations to help restore large pike, among many other measures designed to ensure the future quantity and health of a key species in Minnesota's waterways. Weaving significant historical scientific literature and technical details together with his own research, Pierce's benchmark study documents and synthesizes the long history of northern pike management and describes the latest efforts being taken to better understand and manage this critical and renowned species.

T1  - How to Build a Habitable Planet:&nbsp;The Story of Earth from the Big Bang to Humankind - Revised and Expanded Edition
AN  - 2131958574
AB  - Since its first publication more than twenty-five years ago, How to Build a Habitable Planet has established a legendary reputation as an accessible yet scientifically impeccable introduction to the origin and evolution of Earth, from the Big Bang through the rise of human civilization. This classic account of how our habitable planet was assembled from the stuff of stars introduced readers to planetary, Earth, and climate science by way of a fascinating narrative. Now this great book has been made even better. Harvard geochemist Charles Langmuir has worked closely with the original author, Wally Broecker, one of the world's leading Earth scientists, to revise and expand the book for a new generation of readers for whom active planetary stewardship is becoming imperative. Interweaving physics, astronomy, chemistry, geology, and biology, this sweeping account tells Earth's complete story, from the synthesis of chemical elements in stars, to the formation of the Solar System, to the evolution of a habitable climate on Earth, to the origin of life and humankind. The book also addresses the search for other habitable worlds in the Milky Way and contemplates whether Earth will remain habitable as our influence on global climate grows. It concludes by considering the ways in which humankind can sustain Earth's habitability and perhaps even participate in further planetary evolution. Like no other book, How to Build a Habitable Planet provides an understanding of Earth in its broadest context, as well as a greater appreciation of its possibly rare ability to sustain life over geologic time.

T1  - Zooplankton as an early warning system of persistent organic pollutants contamination in a deep lake (lake Iseo, Northern Italy)
AN  - 2439107326
AB  - The lake Iseo has been recently contaminated by DDT residues, originated from the melting of a glacier that released the pollutants accumulated in the past. Because of this recent input, DDT residues concentrations rose more quickly in zooplankton than in fish during 2009. In autumn 2010 the ratio drastically dropped to one–two for all the compounds indicating that the glacial DDT load should have been ceased. The situation was different for PCBs that were released to a much lower extent from glaciers. The PCB 138 ratio between zooplankton and fish was always around one–two in both years. As the zooplankton response to pollution changes resulted particularly prompt, our research highlights the importance of this component as an early warning bioindicator of hydrophobic pollutants.

T1  - Effect of Multiple Parasitic Infections on the Tolerance to Pollutant Contamination
AN  - 1325521136
AB  - The horizontally-transmitted acanthocephalan parasite Polymorphus minutus and the vertically-transmitted microsporidian parasite Dictyocoela roeselum have both been shown to influence on the antitoxic responses of mono-infected Gammarus roeseli exposed to cadmium. The present study investigates the effect of this co-infection on the antitoxic defence responses of naturally infected females exposed to cadmium stress. Our results revealed that, depending on the cadmium dose, bi-infection induced only slight, significant increased cell damage in G. roeseli as compared to non-infection. In addition, the antitoxic defence pattern of cadmium-exposed bi-infected hosts was similar to the pattern of cadmium-exposed D. roeselum-infected hosts. Reduced glutathione concentrations, carotenoid levels and γ-glutamylcystein ligase activity decreased, while metallothionein concentrations increased. This similar pattern indicates that host physiology can be controlled to some extent by microsporidia under stress conditions. It supports the hypothesis of a disruption of acanthocephalan effects in the presence of microsporidia. However, the global negative effects of bi-infection on host condition should be tested on more biological models, since competition between parasites depends on life history trade-off.

T1  - Behavioural and Physiological Responses of Gammarus pulex Exposed to Cadmium and Arsenate at Three Temperatures: Individual and Combined Effects
AN  - 1325027788
AB  - This study aimed at investigating both the individual and combined effects of cadmium (Cd) and arsenate (AsV) on the physiology and behaviour of the Crustacean Gammarus pulex at three temperatures (5, 10 and15°C). G. pulex was exposed during 96 h to (i) two [Cd] alone, (ii) two [AsV] alone, and (iii) four combinations of [Cd] and [AsV] to obtain a complete factorial plane. After exposure, survival, [AsV] or [Cd] in body tissues, behavioural (ventilatory and locomotor activities) and physiological responses (iono-regulation of [Na+] and [Cl−] in haemolymph) were examined. The interactive effects (antagonistic, additive or synergistic) of binary mixtures were evaluated for each tested temperature using a predictive model for the theoretically expected interactive effect of chemicals. In single metal exposure, both the internal metal concentration in body tissues and the mortality rate increased along metallic gradient concentration. Cd alone significantly impaired both [Na+] and [Cl−] while AsV alone had a weak impact only on [Cl−]. The behavioural responses of G. pulex declined with increasing metal concentration suggesting a reallocation of energy from behavioural responses to maintenance functions. The interaction between AsV and Cd was considered as ‘additive’ for all the tested binary mixtures and temperatures (except for the lowest combination at 10°C considered as “antagonistic”). In binary mixtures, the decrease in both ventilatory and locomotor activities and the decline in haemolymphatic [Cl−] were amplified when respectively compared to those observed with the same concentrations of AsV or Cd alone. However, the presence of AsV decreased the haemolymphatic [Na+] loss when G. pulex was exposed to the lowest Cd concentration. Finally, the observed physiological and behavioural effects (except ventilation) in G. pulex exposed to AsV and/or Cd were exacerbated under the highest temperature. The discussion encompasses both the toxicity mechanisms of these metals and their interaction with rising temperature.

T1  - Life in Europe under Climate Change
AN  - 2131408896
AB  - Life in Europe will indeed go on as the climate changes, but not in the same way as before. The air will be warmer, winds will change, patterns of rainfall and snowfall will alter, and sea level is likely to rise. These phenomena are already being seen. Europe will in the future experience marked changes in vegetation cover, increased floods along rivers and coastlines as well as more frequent droughts and forest fires, often leading to large societal costs. The changes will be minor in some cases, profound in others, but in any case, pervasive. 
This book will inform readers about these effects, as well as showing how Europe is contributing to attempts to slow the tempo of global climate change, and how it can adapt to the climate change that seems unavoidable.

T1  - Environmental Issues for the Twenty-First Century and their Impact on Human Health
AN  - 2131392108
AB  - The close of the first decade of the 21st century posed additional pressing environmental issues related to human activities and their effects on the planet. The need to protect the planet seems frequently to be in conflict with the need to feed the earths inhabitants and to supply the energy required for industry, transportation, regulating our indoor environment, and fueling other needs. The corporate world sometimes seems to have a callous disregard for the safety of its workers and the public at large. This e-book discusses the ecological and health impacts of aquaculture, the Alberta tar sands development, the Gulf Oil disaster of 2010, the hazards of inadequately safeguarding water supplies, and global warming, to name some of the important topics. This e-book will be very useful to students of environmental science, ecology, ecotoxicology and others interested in a broad overview of contemporary environmental issues. It is presented in a highly readable manner that makes it accessible to well-informed members of the public. Complex biochemical and chemical equations are avoided. Nonetheless, current primary sources of scientific information are used and referenced, making it easy for a reader to pursue a topic in greater depth if so desired.

T1  - Avoiding the Pitfall of Progress and Associated Perils of Evolutionary Education
AN  - 1652789237
AB  - Issue Title: Evolutionary Developmental Biology

              
People reflexively see all change as implying inevitably increasing progress and complexity. This expected directionality is especially observed in students' views of living things, with some species envisioned as "higher" or more evolved. Students tend naturally to see all evolutionary change as adaptive, progressive, optimal, and teleological, with improvement achieved as needed or desired by organisms (if not as planned in advance). Following an extended outline of many interrelated ways, this basic yet unfortunately widespread and deep-seated misconception of evolutionary thinking ensnares students and hinders proper understanding of the actual pattern and process of evolution, a more useful pedagogical approach is presented. A strategy that involves eliciting preconceptions, engaging in numerous counterexamples, and continually reinforcing an alternative view is generally effective. This is best achieved by tackling the misconception of progress head-on, with an active learning model that forces students to come up with substitute explanations. Several examples of exercises and activities to combat the universal and automatically intuitive inclination toward teleological notions of progress are given, including analyses of paleontology, ecology, biochemistry, development, and systematics.

T1  - Natural Resources - Technology, Economics and Policy:&nbsp;Technology Economics and Policy
AN  - 2141126494
AB  - Natural resources management has two principal dimensions: Science-illuminated (earth, space, hydrological, pedological, information, etc. sciences) management of local resources (waters, soils, bioresources, minerals, rocks, sediments, etc.) in an ecologically-sustainable manner, and Value-addition through processing of natural products, through the application of technology is most marked in the case of some mineral products. The wellness of a community is dependent upon the security of food, water, environment and energy. Such a security is best realised through science-illuminated (earth, space, hydrological, pedological, information) management of local resources (waters, soils, bioresources, minerals, rocks, sediments, etc.) in an ecologically-sustainable and people-participatory manner, plus value-addition through processing of natural products. Moreover, the addition of value may increase a community's wealth by advanced technologies, trading, exchange of knowledge, etc. Moreover, activities, employment and many other things come along with the availability of natural resources, which will require and affect policy.This volume provides guidelines for the implementation of technological, economical and policy advances in dealing with various aspects of natural resources. It is intended for researchers, professionals and students in environmental and earth sciences, mining, geography, sociology, economics and for policy makers and investors searching for potential in the natural resources industry. Ideal for consultation in combination with the editor's related publications Green Energy: Technology, Economics and Policy, Energy Portfolios and Food and Water Security.

T1  - Cellular and Transcriptional Responses of Crassostrea gigas Hemocytes Exposed in Vitro to Brevetoxin (PbTx-2)
AN  - 1536000856
AB  - Hemocytes mediate a series of immune reactions essential for bivalve survival in the environment, however, the impact of harmful algal species and their associated phycotoxins upon bivalve immune system is under debate. To better understand the possible toxic effects of these toxins, Crassostrea gigas hemocytes were exposed to brevetoxin (PbTx-2). Hemocyte viability, monitored through the neutral red retention and MTT reduction assays, and apoptosis (Hoechst staining) remained unchanged during 12 h of exposure to PbTx-2 in concentrations up to 1000 µg/L. Despite cell viability and apoptosis remained stable, hemocytes incubated for 4 h with 1000 µg/L of PbTx-2 revealed higher expression levels of Hsp70 (p < 0.01) and CYP356A1 ( p < 0.05) transcripts and a tendency to increase FABP expression, as evaluated by Real-Time quantitative PCR. The expression of other studied genes (BPI, IL-17, GSTO, EcSOD, Prx6, SOD and GPx) remained unchanged. The results suggest that the absence of cytotoxic effects of PbTx-2 in Crassostrea gigas hemocytes, even at high concentrations, allow early defense responses to be produced by activating protective mechanisms associated to detoxification (CYP356A1 and possibly FABP) and stress (Hsp70), but not to immune or to antioxidant (BPI, IL-17, EcSOD, Prx6, GPx and SOD) related genes.

T1  - Aquaculture and Behavior
AN  - 2131248504
AB  - Modern aquaculture is faced with a number of challenges, including public concern about environmental impacts and the welfare of farmed fish. A fundamental understanding of fish biology is central to finding ways to meet these challenges and is also essential for maintaining the industry's sustainability. 

Aquaculture & Behavior provides such fundamental understanding with reference to behavioral biology, describing how to avoid problems caused by the natural behavior of farmed fish and providing information that, when properly applied, results in significant benefits for both the fish and the farmer. 
Written and edited by an authoritative team, 
Aquaculture & Behavior provides a clear and concise account of aspects of fish biology that are central to aquaculture, gives expert guidance on the behavioral biology of farmed fish and explains how this can be, and is, applied to improve aquaculture practice. Special consideration is given to the role of behavior, why biologists are interested in behavior, and how they study and explain it. The authors focus on the techniques that have been developed for investigating the behavior of fish on farms and the behavior that we require of fish that are cultured for food, for science, for the ornamental trade and for release. The book also discusses and explores the issue of fish welfare and how it can be defined, identified and measured and features strategies for improving the welfare of farmed fish. 
Informative and engaging, 
Aquaculture & Behavior brings the reader up-to-date with major issues pertaining to aquaculture. Everyone from fish farmers to upper level students will find this book a valuable and practical resource. Libraries in universities and research establishments where animal behavior, aquaculture, veterinary and biological sciences are studied and taught should have copies of this work on their shelves.Modern aquaculture is faced with a number of challenges, including public concern about environmental impacts and the welfare of farmed fish.

T1  - Global Perspectives on the Biology and Life History of the White Shark
AN  - 2132998521
AB  - Inspired by the International White Shark Symposium in 2010, Global Perspectives on the Biology and Life History of the White Shark incorporates the most important contemporary research findings into a single peer-reviewed book. This beautifully illustrated reference represents a historic change in the context of White Shark (Carcharodon carcharias) research. Once considered one of the most poorly understood and difficult sharks to study, this timely book recognizes a new sophisticated focus on the White Shark, raising its status from obscurity to enlightenment. The Global Perspectives on the Biology and Life History of the White Shark celebrates the White Shark as the most studied shark in the sea. Within the chapters one can find new insights into a vast range of topics, such as behavior, physiology, migration patterns, habitat preferences, daily activity patterns, molecular genetics, reproductive biology and new research methods. The book also delves into population monitoring and policy options for managers and researchers.

T1  - Risks of Using Antifouling Biocides in Aquaculture
AN  - 1526009430
AB  - Biocides are chemical substances that can deter or kill the microorganisms responsible for biofouling. The rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry is having a significant impact on the marine ecosystems. As the industry expands, it requires the use of more drugs, disinfectants and antifoulant compounds (biocides) to eliminate the microorganisms in the aquaculture facilities. The use of biocides in the aquatic environment, however, has proved to be harmful as it has toxic effects on the marine environment. Organic booster biocides were recently introduced as alternatives to the organotin compounds found in antifouling products after restrictions were imposed on the use of tributyltin (TBT). The replacement products are generally based on copper metal oxides and organic biocides. The biocides that are most commonly used in antifouling paints include chlorothalonil, dichlofluanid, DCOIT (4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one, Sea-nine 211®), Diuron, Irgarol 1051, TCMS pyridine (2,3,3,6-tetrachloro-4-methylsulfonyl pyridine), zinc pyrithione and Zineb. There are two types of risks associated with the use of biocides in aquaculture: (i) predators and humans may ingest the fish and shellfish that have accumulated in these contaminants and (ii) the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. This paper provides an overview of the effects of antifouling (AF) biocides on aquatic organisms. It also provides some insights into the effects and risks of these compounds on non-target organisms.

AB  - The present study evaluates toxicity of metal, ferrous sulphate and its impact on biochemical constituents like total sugars, total proteins, and total lipids in the fresh water edible carp Catla catla. Biochemical constituents weredetermined by standard biochemical procedures in the four tissues i.e., muscle, liver,brain and kidney of unexposed (Control) healthy fish and the fish exposed to 96-hr LC50 (Lethal) and sub-lethal concentration of the lethal dose for zero day, 4th day and 7th days of exposure of heavy metal, ferrous sulphate. The elevatedlevels of sugars are apparently indicative of the organism’s response to the toxicant stress.

T1  - Shell Shape Analysis and Spatial Allometry Patterns of Manila Clam ( Ruditapes philippinarum) in a Mesotidal Coastal Lagoon
AN  - 1272300942
AB  - While gradual allometric changes of shells are intrinsically driven by genotype, morphometrical shifts can also be modulated by local environmental conditions. Consequently the common use of a unique dimension (usually length) to assess bivalves' growth may mask phenotypic differences in valve shape among populations. A morphometric exhaustive study was conducted on Manila clam, Ruditapes philippinarum, by acquiring data in the French Arcachon Bay (intrasite phenotypic variability) and by comparing with other sites in the literature (intersite phenotypic variability). 2070 shells were subsampled, weighted, and automatically measured using TNPC software. Some ratios' values indicate a relatively round and globular shape shell in comparison with other sites confirming poor conditions for some individuals. Among adult clams, three main morphological groups were identified and discussed according to spatial considerations. Allometric relations for pairs of shell descriptors were determined by testing classical linear and piecewise regression models on log-transformed relation of Huxley. A significant shape change correlated to size was observed; it corresponds to the second year of life of the clam. Relationships between density, disease, and shell shape are demonstrated and discussed related to other potential factors affecting shell shape. Finally, consequences on population regulation are addressed.

T1  - Ficaria verna Huds. extracts and their [beta]-cyclodextrin supramolecular systems
AN  - 1018030859
AB  - Doc number: 16              Abstract              Background: Obtaining new pharmaceutical materials with enhanced properties by using natural compounds and environment-friendly methods is a continuous goal for scientists. Ficaria verna  Huds. is a widespread perennial plant with applications in the treat of haemorrhoids and to cure piles; it has also anti-inflammatory, astringent, and antibiotic properties. The goal of the present study is the obtaining and characterization of new F. verna  extract/β-cyclodextrin complexes by using only natural compounds, solvents, and environment-friendly methods in order to increase the quality and acceptability versus toxicity indicator. Thus, the flavonoid content (as quercetin) of Ficaria verna  Huds. flowers and leaves from the West side of Romania was determined and correlated with their antioxidant activity. Further, the possibility of obtaining β-cyclodextrin supramolecular systems was studied.              Results: F. verna  flowers and leaves extracts were obtained by semi-continuous solid-liquid extraction. The raw concentrated extract was spectrophotometrically analyzed in order to quantify the flavonoids from plant parts and to evaluate the antioxidant activity of these extracts. The F. verna  extracts were used for obtaining β-cyclodextrin complexes; these were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and Karl Fischer water titration; spectrophotometry was used in order to quantifying the flavonoids and evaluates the antioxidant activity. A higher concentration of flavonoids of 0.5% was determined in complexes obtained by crystallisation method, while only a half of this value was calculated for kneading method. The antioxidant activity of these complexes was correlated with the flavonoid content and this parameter reveals possible controlled release properties.              Conclusions: The flavonoid content of F. verna  Huds. from the West side of Romania (Banat county) is approximately the same in flowers and leaves, being situated at a medium value among other studies. β-Cyclodextrin complexes of F. verna  extracts are obtained with lower yields by crystallisation than kneading methods, but the flavonoids (as quercetin) are better encapsulated in the first case most probably due to the possibility to attain the host -guest  equilibrium in the slower crystallisation process. F. verna  extracts and their β-cyclodextrin complexes have antioxidant activity even at very low concentrations and could be used in proper and valuable pharmaceutical formulations with enhanced bioactivity.

T1  - Limnology
AN  - 2134048816
AB  - Limnology provides an in-depth and current overview of the field of limnology. The result of a major tour de force by two renowned and experienced experts, this unique and richly illustrated reference presents a wealth of data on limnology history, water as a substrate, lakes' origins and aquatic biota. Besides a general part, it gives special focus to neotropical limnology, prevalently applicable in countries in the Southern Hemisphere. Starting with the essentials, some definitions and a historical account, this volume then details the main interaction mechanisms with physical and chemical factors, diversity and geographical distribution. With regard to the major continental aquatic systems, it treats the dynamics, variability and characterization of lakes, reservoirs, flooded areas, saline lakes, estuaries and coastal lagoons. The impact of human activity on water resources and the need for the rehabilitation of watersheds, watershed ecosystems and estuaries are addressed subsequently. To illustrate theory, the final part includes research examples in limnology, ecology and environmental sciences in different geographical contexts, as well as ideas for new investigations. This reference volume is intended for researchers and professionals working on inland waters, lakes and rivers within the fields of biology, ecology, environment, forestry, geochemistry, geophysics, and water management. It will also benefit students in the aforementioned areas and readers involved with limnology in related disciplines, such as earth sciences, environmental, water and geological engineering.

T1  - Epigenetic Principles of Evolution
AN  - 2148871408
AB  - This is the first and only book, so far, to deal with the causal basis of evolution from an epigenetic view. By revealing the epigenetic user of the genetic toolkit, this book demonstrates the primacy of epigenetic mechanisms and epigenetic information in generating evolutionary novelties. 
The author convincingly supports his theory with a host of examples from the most varied fields of biology, by emphasizing changes in developmental pathways as the basic source of evolutionary change in metazoans. 
Original and thought provoking--a radically new theory that overcomes the present difficulties of the theory of evolutionIs the first and only theory that uses epigenetic mechanisms and principles for explaining evolution of metazoansTakes an integrative approach and shows a wide range of learning

T1  - The Ciliated Protozoa:&nbsp;Characterization, Classification, and Guide to the Literature
AN  - 2130867121
AB  - The third edition of The Ciliated Protozoa continues the innovative approach of the previous two editions, thoroughly documenting the progress in our understanding of the evolutionary diversification of these widely distributed eukaryotic microorganisms. 
The Glossary is considerably revised and expanded, serving as an illustrated 'subject index' of more than 700 terms. An introduction to the phylum is followed by chapters on the 11 classes. Each class chapter contains 7 sections: 
 
taxonomic structure 
life history and ecology 
somatic structures 
oral structures 
division and morphogenesis 
nuclei, sexuality, and life cycle 
other features  
The book includes new data on the ultrastructure of the somatic cortex of each class, molecular phylogenetics, ecology, and on other important aspects of ciliate biology. These new data are used, along with a novel conceptual approach, to rationalize a new system of classification for the phylum, presented in a major chapter on The Ciliate Taxa. The book includes an up-to-date bibliography of approximately 3,000 citations to both the 'classical' and recent literature, and both a Subject Index and a Systematic Index. 
This unique and timely book will serve as a comprehensive and authoritative reference work for students, teachers, and researchers who have an interest in the protozoa, and particularly the ciliates. 
As an additional feature, all figures are available electronically for free viewing on the book's homepage at www.springer.com/978-1-4020-8238-2, under Additional Information. 
 Completely revised and updated Major chapter on The Ciliate Taxa Glossary with more than 700 terms Contains hundreds of illustrations Contains both Subject and Systematic indices Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras
Dr. Denis H. Lynn received his graduate training at the University of Toronto where he received his Ph.D. Protozoology in 1975. His early research on the comparative ultrastructure of ciliates was published in Biological Reviews and lead to a revised classification of the Phylum Ciliophora, which was published in 1981 in collaboration with Eugene B. Small. Dr. Lynn has published extensively on ciliates, authoring more than a dozen book chapters and almost 120 refereed publications. He is currently a full professor in the Department of Integrative Biology, University of Guelph, and Editor in Chief of The Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology.

T1  - Drought and Aquatic Ecosystems:&nbsp;Effects and Responses
AN  - 2131422145
AB  - Droughts are a major hazard to both natural and human-dominated environments and those, especially of long duration and high intensity, can be highly damaging and leave long-lasting effects. This book describes the climatic conditions that give rise to droughts, and their various forms and chief attributes. Past droughts are described including those that had severe impacts on human societies. As a disturbance, droughts can be thought of as "ramps" in that they usually build slowly and take time to become evident. As precipitation is reduced, flows from catchments into aquatic systems decline. As water declines in water bodies, ecological processes are changed and the biota can be drastically reduced, though species and populations may survive by using refuges.  Recovery from drought varies in both rates and in degrees of completeness and may be a function of both refuge availability and connectivity. 
For the first time, this book reviews the available rather scattered literature on the impacts of drought on the flora, fauna and ecological processes of aquatic ecosystems ranging from small ponds to lakes and from streams to estuaries.  The effects of drought on the biota of standing waters and flowing waters and of temporary waters and perennial systems are described and compared. In addition, the ways in which human activity can exacerbate droughts are outlined. In many parts of the world especially in the mid latitudes, global warming may result in increases in the duration and intensity of droughts.  

Drought and Aquatic Ecosystems is essential reading for freshwater ecologists, water resource managers and advanced students.Droughts are a major hazard to both natural and human-dominated environments and those, especially of long duration and high intensity, can be highly damaging and leave long-lasting effects.

Philip "Sam" Lake is an Emeritus Professor in the School of Biological Sciences and a Fellow of the Australian Centre for Biodiversity at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. Much of his research has focussed on the effects that both natural disturbances (e.g. floods, droughts) and human-generated ones (e.g. pollution, catchment land-use change) have on the biota of freshwater systems. Recently, he has also been investigating the ecological processes involved in the restoration of degraded flowing waters.

AB  - Upper Miocene Pannonian sediments from Belgrade (Serbia): new evidence and paleoenvironmental considerations              The Late Miocene sublittoral marls of the Pannonian Stage (the long-lived Lake Pannon) were studied. From neotectonic point of view, the investigated area represents a natural border between two different morphostructural domains: the Pannonian Basin to the north and the Peri-Pannonian Realm to the south. More than 20 mollusc and 34 ostracod species were identified which indicate the upper part of the Lower Pannonian and the lower part of the Middle Pannonian ("Serbian") predominantly. The identified dinoflagellate cyst assemblage (21 taxa) hinders assignment of the studied samples to a Pannonian substage but supports the high endemism of the Pannonian flora. The lithostratigraphical, paleontological, and paleoecological analyses indicate a mesohaline (8-16 [per thousand]), sublittoral (<90 m deep) environment of the early Lake Pannon. The estimated stratigraphic range for the investigated deposits is 9.8-11.4 Ma.

T1  - Philosophy of Ecology
AN  - 2135035897
AB  - The most pressing problems facing humanity today OCo over-population, energy shortages, climate change, soil erosion, species extinctions, the risk of epidemic disease, the threat of warfare that could destroy all the hard-won gains of civilization, and even the recent fibrillations of the stock market OCo are all ecological or have a large ecological component. in this volume philosophers turn their attention to understanding the science of ecology and its huge implications for the human project.
a 
To get the application of ecology to policy or other practical concerns right, humanity needs a clear and disinterested philosophical understanding of ecology which can help identify the practical lessons of science. Conversely, the urgent practical demands humanity faces today cannot help but direct scientific and philosophical investigation toward the basis of those ecological challenges that threaten human survival. This book will help to fuel the timely renaissance of interest in philosophy of ecology that is now occurring in the philosophical profession. 
Provides a bridge between philosophy and current scientific findingsCovers theory and applicationsEncourages multi-disciplinary dialogue"

T1  - Shaping mechanisms of metal specificity in a family of metazoan metallothioneins: evolutionary differentiation of mollusc metallothioneins
AN  - 902278210; 21255385
AB  - Abstract              Background: The degree of metal binding specificity in metalloproteins such as metallothioneins (MTs) can be crucial for their functional accuracy. Unlike most other animal species, pulmonate molluscs possess homometallic MT isoforms loaded with Cu+  or Cd2+ . They have, so far, been obtained as native metal-MT complexes from snail tissues, where they are involved in the metabolism of the metal ion species bound to the respective isoform. However, it has not as yet been discerned if their specific metal occupation is the result of a rigid control of metal availability, or isoform expression programming in the hosting tissues or of structural differences of the respective peptides determining the coordinative options for the different metal ions. In this study, the Roman snail (Helix pomatia ) Cu-loaded and Cd-loaded isoforms (HpCuMT and HpCdMT) were used as model molecules in order to elucidate the biochemical and evolutionary mechanisms permitting pulmonate MTs to achieve specificity for their cognate metal ion.              Results: HpCuMT and HpCdMT were recombinantly synthesized in the presence of Cd2+ , Zn2+  or Cu2+  and corresponding metal complexes analysed by electrospray mass spectrometry and circular dichroism (CD) and ultra violet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometry. Both MT isoforms were only able to form unique, homometallic and stable complexes (Cd6 -HpCdMT and Cu12 -HpCuMT) with their cognate metal ions. Yeast complementation assays demonstrated that the two isoforms assumed metal-specific functions, in agreement with their binding preferences, in heterologous eukaryotic environments. In the snail organism, the functional metal specificity of HpCdMT and HpCuMT was contributed by metal-specific transcription programming and cell-specific expression. Sequence elucidation and phylogenetic analysis of MT isoforms from a number of snail species revealed that they possess an unspecific and two metal-specific MT isoforms, whose metal specificity was achieved exclusively by evolutionary modulation of non-cysteine amino acid positions.              Conclusion: The Roman snail HpCdMT and HpCuMT isoforms can thus be regarded as prototypes of isoform families that evolved genuine metal-specificity within pulmonate molluscs. Diversification into these isoforms may have been initiated by gene duplication, followed by speciation and selection towards opposite needs for protecting copper-dominated metabolic pathways from nonessential cadmium. The mechanisms enabling these proteins to be metal-specific could also be relevant for other metalloproteins.

T1  - Forecasting hypoxia in the Chesapeake Bay and Gulf of Mexico: model accuracy, precision, and sensitivity to ecosystem change
AN  - 2551226256
AB  - Increasing use of ecological models for management and policy requires robust evaluation of
model precision, accuracy, and sensitivity to ecosystem change. We conducted such an
evaluation of hypoxia models for the northern Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay using
hindcasts of historical data, comparing several approaches to model calibration. For both
systems we find that model sensitivity and precision can be optimized and model
accuracy maintained within reasonable bounds by calibrating the model to relatively
short, recent 3year datasets. Model accuracy was higher for Chesapeake Bay
than for the Gulf of Mexico, potentially indicating the greater importance of
unmodeled processes in the latter system. Retrospective analyses demonstrate
both directional and variable changes in sensitivity of hypoxia to nutrient loads.

T1  - The Desert Year
AN  - 2131265713
AB  - Now back in print, Joseph Wood KrutchOCOs Burroughs AwardOCowinning "The Desert Year" is as beautiful as it is philosophically profound. Although KrutchOCooften called the Cactus WaldenOCocame to the desert relatively late in his life, his curiosity and delight in his surroundings abound throughout "The Desert Year, " whether he is marveling at the majesty of the endless dry sea, at flowers carpeting the desert floor, or at the unexpected appearance of an army of frogs after a heavy rain. KrutchOCOs trenchant observations about life prospering in the hostile environment of ArizonaOCOs Sonoran Desert turn to weighty questions about humanity and the precariousness of our existence, putting lie to Western denials of mind in the OC lowerOCO forms of life: OC Let us not say that this animal or even this plant has OCybecome adaptedOCO to desert conditions. Let us say rather that they have all shown courage and ingenuity in making the best of the world as they found it. And let us remember that if to use such terms in connection with them is a fallacy then it can only be somewhat less a fallacy to use the same terms in connection with ourselves.OCO This edition contains 33 exacting drawings by noted illustrator Rudolf Freund. Closely tied to KrutchOCOs uncluttered text, the drawings tell a story of ineffable beauty. a"

T1  - Fecal Bacteria
AN  - 2131952060
AB  - The Fecal Bacteria offers a balanced, integrated discussion of fecal bacteria and their presence and ecology in the intestinal tract of mammals, in the environment, and in the food supply. This new volume covers their use in examining and assessing water quality in order to offer protection from illnesses related to swimming in or ingesting contaminated water, in addition to discussing their use in engineering considerations of water quality, modeling, monitoring, and regulations. Fecal bacteria are additionally used as indicators of contamination of ready-to-eat foods and fresh produce. The intestinal environment, the microbial community structure of the gut microbiota, and the physiology and genomics of this broad group of microorganisms are explored in the book. With contributions from an internationally recognized group of experts, the book integrates medicine, public health, environmental, and microbiological topics in order to provide a unique, holistic understanding of fecal bacteria. Moreover, it shows how the latest basic science and applied research findings are helping to solve problems and develop effective management strategies. For example, readers will discover how the latest tools and molecular approaches have led to our current understanding of fecal bacteria and enabled us to improve human health and water quality. The Fecal Bacteria is recommended for microbiologists, clinicians, animal scientists, engineers, environmental scientists, food safety experts, water quality managers, and students. It will help them better understand fecal bacteria and use their knowledge to protect human and environmental health. They can also apply many of the techniques and molecular tools discussed in this book to the study of a broad range of microorganisms in a variety of habitats.

T1  - The Biogeography of Host-Parasite Interactions
AN  - 2130895015
AB  - Biogeography has renewed its concepts and methods following important recent advances in phylogenetics, macroecology, and geographic information systems. In parallel, the evolutionary ecology of host-parasite interactions has attracted the interests of numerous studies dealing with life-history traits evolution, community ecology, and evolutionary epidemiology.The Biogeography of Host-Parasite Interactions is the first book to integrate these two fields, using examples from a variety of host-parasite associations in various regions, and across both ecological and evolutionary timescales. Besides a strong theoretical component, there is a bias towards applications, specifically in the fields of historical biogeography, palaeontology, phylogeography, landscape epidemiology, invasion biology, conservation biology, human evolution, and healthecology. A particular emphasis concerns emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases linked to global changes.

T1  - Cultural Studies and Environmentalism:&nbsp;The Confluence of EcoJustice, Place-Based (Science) Education, and Indigenous Knowledge Systems
AN  - 2132991954
AB  - As the first book to explore the confluence of three emerging yet critical fields of study, this work sets an exacting standard. The editors' aim was to produce the most authoritative guide for ecojustice, place-based education, and indigenous knowledge in education. Aimed at a wide audience that includes, but is not restricted to, science educators and policymakers, Cultural Studies and Environmentalism starts from the premise that schooling is a small part of the larger educational domain in which we live and learn. Informed by this overarching notion, the book opens up ways in which home-grown talents, narratives, and knowledge can be developed, and eco-region awareness and global relationships can be facilitated. Incorporating a diversity of perspectives that include photography, poetry and visual art, the work provides a nuanced lens for evaluating educational problems and community conditions while protecting and conserving the most threatened and vulnerable narratives. Editors and contributors share the view that the impending loss of these narratives should be discussed much more widely than is currently the case, and that both teachers and children can take on some of the responsibility for their preservation.The relevance of ecojustice to this process is clear. Ecojustice philosophy is a way of learning about how we frame, or perceive, the world around us--and why that matters. Although it is not synonymous with social or environmental justice, the priorities of ecojustice span the globe in the same way. It incorporates a deep recognition of the appropriateness and significance of learning from place-based experiences and indigenous knowledge systems rather than depending on some urgent "ecological crises" to advocate for school and societal change. With a multiplicity of diverse voices coming together to explore its key themes, this book is an important starting point for educators in many arenas. It brings into better focus a vital role for theEarth's ecosystems in the context of ecosociocultural theory and participatory democracy alike."Encompassing theoretical, empirical, and experiential standpoints concerning place-based knowledge systems, this unique book argues for a transformation of (science) education's intellectual tradition of thinking that emphasizes individual cognition. In its place, the book offers a wisdom tradition of thinking, living, and being that emphasizes community survival in harmony within itself and with Mother Earth." Glen AikenheadOnly book that creates a confluence between ecojustice ethics and decision-making Pertinent to course development for both environmental and science education Clearly lays out the commonalities between ecojustice, place-based, and indigenous knowledge Supports new visions and research directions for 21st century schooling

T1  - Cents and Sustainability:&nbsp;Securing Our Common Future by Decoupling Economic Growth from Environmental Pressures
AN  - 2131800995
AB  - Cents and Sustainability is a clear-sighted response to the 1987 call by Dr Gro Brundtland in Our Common Future to achieve a new era of economic growth that is 'forceful and at the same time socially and environmentally sustainable'. The Brundtland Report argued that not only was it achievable, but that it was an urgent imperative in order to achieve a transition to sustainable development while significantly reducing poverty and driving 'clean and green' investment. With some still arguing for significantly slowing economic growth in order to reduce pressures on the environment, this new book, Cents and Sustainability, shows that it is possible to reconcile the need for economic growth and environmental sustainability through a strategy to decouple economic growth from environmental pressures, combined with a renewed commitment to achieve significant environmental restoration and poverty reduction. Beginning with a brief overview of some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time, the book then explains 'decoupling theory', overviews a number of factors that can undermine and even block efforts to decouple in both developed and developing countries, and then discusses a number of key considerations to assist the development of national 'decoupling strategies'. The book then focuses on presenting evidence to support greater action, not just on climate change, but also on decoupling economic growth from the loss of biodiversity and the deterioration of natural systems, freshwater extraction, waste production, and air pollution.In the lead up to the 2012 United Nations Earth Summit and beyond, Cents and Sustainability will be a crucial guide to inform and assist nations to develop strategies to significantly reduce environmental pressures, strengthen their economy, create jobs and reduce poverty. 'I commend the team from The Natural Edge Project and their partners for undertaking to develop a response to 'Our Common Future' to mark its 20th anniversary.'

T1  - Cruise Tourism in Polar Regions:&nbsp;Promoting Environmental and Social Sustainability?
AN  - 2135396087
AB  - Cruises are the primary form of tourism in the Polar Regions and cruise ship tourism in both the Arctic and Antarctic is expanding rapidly. The industry has moved beyond its infancy, and is now entering a maturing phase with increased numbers and types of vessels, more demanding routes, and more regular and predictable patterns of activity. The increase in cruise activities, and the associated risks of accidents, as well as the potential and actual impacts of the large numbers of tourists in the polar regions bring with it management challenges for sustainable use of these regions. This book discusses critically the issues around environmental and social sustainability of the cruise industry in Polar Regions. Authors from Canada, USA, Europe, Australia and New Zealand are experts in their respective fields and take an innovative, critical and at times controversial approach to the subject.

T1  - Population and individual consequences of breeding resource availability in the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus)
AN  - 375565080
AB  - Resource availability may affect both individual fitness and population demography and the effects can interact. We used two experiments to test how breeding resource abundance and its spatial distribution, combined with female abundance, affected male reproductive behavior, population spawning rate, and embryo development and recruitment in the European bitterling (Rhodeus amarus), a small cyprinid fish that lays its eggs in living unionid mussels. In the first experiment, we found that at the population level the abundance of breeding resources (freshwater mussels) was more important for bitterling recruitment than resource spatial distribution (clumped or regular). In contrast at the individual level, (variability in reproductive success) the spatial distribution of resources was more important, but only when resource abundance was not limiting. Territorial males obtained almost exclusive access to fertilizations when resources were abundant and distributed regularly, but were unable to defend large clusters of resources (when rival abundance was always high) and abandoned territoriality. Surprisingly, territorial males remained aggressive and successfully defended their territories when resources were grouped into a single cluster, but at a low abundance. In the second experiment, more rapid embryo development and larger juvenile body size at the end of the growing season was detected at high resource abundance and low female abundance, indicating that early hatched juveniles survived better and hence investment in offspring production early in the season yields a higher fitness pay-offs. The abundance of females in spawning condition was the best overall predictor of the intensity of male reproductive behavior in both experiments.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Marine and Freshwater Harmful Algal Blooms
AN  - 2132089422
AB  - Freshwater harmful algal blooms (HABs) are comprised of algae that either create health hazards for humans or animals through the production of toxins or bioactive compounds or that cause deterioration of water quality through the build-up of high biomass, which degrades aesthetic, ecological, and recreational values. While freshwater HABs occur naturally, human actions that disturb ecosystems in the form of increased nutrient loadings and pollution, modified hydrology, and introduced species have been linked to the increased occurrence of some freshwater HABs. The majority of the freshwater HAB problems reported in the United States and worldwide are due to one group of algae, the cyanobacteria HABs (CyanoHABs), but other groups of algae can also be harmful. CyanoHABs are not a new phenomenon, but the frequency and geographic distribution of documented CyanoHABs seem to have dramatically increased in recent decades in the United States and globally. This book describes the broad range of negative impacts that freshwater HAB toxins have on humans, animals and aquatic ecosystems and actions that must be taken to resolve this issue. This book consists of public documents which have been located, gathered, combined, reformatted, and enhanced with a subject index, selectively edited and bound to provide easy access.

T1  - Harmful Algal Blooms - Impact and Response
AN  - 2131303416
AB  - Algae are the most abundant photosynthetic organisms in marine and freshwater ecosystems and are essential, energy-producing components of aquatic food webs. Harmful algal bloom or "HAB" species are a small subset of algal species that produce toxins and/or bloom to excess, thus creating harm to humans and ecosystems. Humans, domestic animals, and wildlife, including endangered species, can be exposed to algal toxins through their food, drinking water, the water in which they swim, or aerosols. It is widely believed that the frequency and geographic distribution of HABs have been increasing worldwide. All U.S. coastal states have experienced HABs over the last decade, and new species have emerged in some locations that were not previously known to cause problems. The authors of this book analyze and discuss the most recent research done in this field.This book consists of public documents which have been located, gathered, combined, reformatted, and enhanced with a subject index, selectively edited and bound to provide easy access.

T1  - Pollution Control: Management, Technology and Regulations:&nbsp;Management, Technology and Regulations
AN  - 2131230580
AB  - Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into an environment that causes instability, disorder, harm or discomfort to the ecosystem i.e., physical systems or living organisms. Pollution can take the form of chemical substances, or energy, such as noise, heat, or light. Pollutants, the elements of pollution, can be foreign substances or energies, or naturally occurring. When naturally occurring, they are considered contaminants when they exceed natural levels. This new book reviews research on global pollution control including organic waste valorization in agriculture and its environmental risk implications.

T1  - Issues of the Day:&nbsp;100 Commentaries on Climate, Energy, the Environment, Transportation, and Public Health Policy
AN  - 2130948157
AB  - Issues of the Day provides an easy way for students, academics, journalists, policymakers, and the public to learn about a diverse range of policy issues affecting the environment, energy, transportation, and public health. Each commentary gives a short assessment of a topic, summarizing in a non-technical way the current state of analysis or evidence on the issue, along with selected recommendations for further reading. The essays are written by world renowned scholars, mostly economists, and provide useful insights on policy problems that are often complex and poorly understood. Some of the topics covered include air pollution, hazardous waste, voluntary environmental programs, domestic (U.S.) and global climate policy design, fishery management, water quality, endangered species, forest fires, oil security, solar power, road and airport, fuel taxes and fuel economy standards, alternative fuel vehicles, health and longevity, smoking, malaria, tuberculosis, and the environment and development. The objective is to disseminate the findings of sound, objective research on the costs, benefits, and appropriate reform of public policies. The book provides a useful supplement for undergraduate- and graduate-level course reading, a reference guide for professionals, and a way for the general reader to quickly develop an informed perspective on the most important policy problems of the day.Issues of the Day is available to download as a PDF from the Resources for the Future website: www.rff.org/weeklycommentary

T1  - Green Chemistry in Protected Horticulture: The Use of Peroxyacetic Acid as a Sustainable Strategy
AN  - 1526000707
AB  - Global reduction of chemical deposition into the environment is necessary. In protected horticulture, different strategies with biodegradable products are used to control pathogens. This review presents the available tools, especially for the management of protected horticultural species, including vegetables and ornamental plants. An analysis of the potential for degradable products that control pathogens and also encourage other productive factors, such as oxygen in the root system, is presented. Biosecurity in fertigation management of protected horticulture is conducted by using peroxyacetic acid mixtures that serve three basic principles: first, the manufacture of these products does not involve polluting processes; second, they have the same function as other chemicals, and third, after use and management there is no toxic residue left in the environment. The sustainability of protected horticulture depends on the development and introduction of technologies for implementation in the field.

The alphabetical listing of toxic substances and chemicals in Part B and C serves as a quick reference for professionals. Additionally, the international focus of "Ecotoxicology" and the range of toxins it covers will make it an indispensable resource to scientists. The password-protected companion website will contain estimation of ecotoxicological parameters (EEP) software developed by the author. EEPaallows users to get ecotoxicological properties of chemicals in databases or they can estimate them (there are only a few percentages in the database). There are very specific estimation methods that only estimate, for instance the properties for halogenated aromatic compounds, or there are very general estimation methods. EEP covers the very general methods and is fast to use butagives in general estimation of higher uncertainty than the very specific methods. Provides an overview of the theory and application of global ecology International focus and range of ecosystems makes Ecotoxicology an indispensable resource to scientists Based on the bestselling Encyclopedia of Ecology Full-color figures and tables support the text and aid in understanding "

T1  - Evolutionary Behavioral Ecology
AN  - 2130920578
AB  - Evolutionary Behavioral Ecology is intended to be used as a text for graduate students and a sourcebook for professional scientists seeking an understanding of the evolutionary and ecological processes shaping behavior across a wide array of organisms and a diverse set of behaviors. Chapters are written by leading experts in the field, providing a core foundation, a history of conceptual developments, and fresh insight into the controversies and themes shaping the continuing development of the field. Essays on adaptation, selection, fitness, genetics, plasticity, and phylogeny as they pertain to behavior place the field in the broader context of ecology and evolution. These concepts, along with a diversity of theoretical approaches are applied to the evolution of behavior in a many contexts, from individual decision-making of solitary animals through to complex social interactions. Chapters integrate conceptual and theoretical approaches with recent empirical advances to understand the evolution of behavior, from foraging, dealing with risk, predator avoidance, and an array of social behaviors, including fighting and cooperation with conspecifics and conflict and cooperation between the sexes. The material emphasizes integrative and novel approaches to behavior, including cognitive ecology, personality, conservation biology, the links between behavior and evolution, the evolution of human social behavior, and ways in which modern genetic analyses can augment the study of behavior.

T1  - Teaching Environmental Literacy:&nbsp;Across Campus and Across the Curriculum
AN  - 2132038159
AB  - To prepare today's students to meet growing global environmental challenges, colleges and universities must make environmental literacy a core learning goal for all students, in all disciplines. But what should an environmentally literate citizen know? What teaching and learning strategies are most effective in helping students think critically about human-environment interactions and sustainability, and integrate what they have learned in diverse settings? Educators from the natural and social sciences and the humanities discuss the critical content, skills, and affective qualities essential to environmental literacy. This volume is an invaluable resource for developing integrated, campus-wide programs to prepare students to think critically about, and to work to create, a sustainable society.

T1  - Environmentalism: Environmental Strategies and Environmental Sustainability:&nbsp;Environmental Strategies and Environmental Sustainability
AN  - 2131762893
AB  - Environmentalism is a broad philosophy and social movement centered on a concern for the conservation and improvement of the environment. This book puts forward some key strategies for promoting Cleaner Production in China, for instance, integrating CP into sustainability strategies, technology innovations and industrial ecology. Furthermore, the authors examine the Energy Masting Planning, a comprehensive plan that addresses energy supply and consumption through 2020. The plan includes energy efficiency, renewable energy and infrastructure and land use policies and emphasizes both the benefits and the limits of the approach. Furthermore, removal of toxic and heavy metal contaminants from aqueous environments is one of the most important environmental issues to face the world. In this book, aerobic degradation through bioaccumulation by bacteria and microalgae and enzyme-catalyzed reduction-based remediation of toxicants from waste waters are discussed. Other chapters in this book examine the attitudes of university students towards the environment and environmental problems, the influence on the causes of forest decline and an analysis of specific factors that influence the nominal median price of single-family homes across states, with a particular emphasis placed on the capitalization of environmental factors such as environmental pollution in the form of toxic chemical releases.

T1  - Lakes of Pontchartrain:&nbsp;Their History and Environments
AN  - 2132075739
AB  - A vital and volatile part of the New Orleans landscape and lifestyle, the Lake Pontchartrain Basin actually contains three major bodies of water--Lakes Borgne, Pontchartrain, and Maurepas. These make up the Pontchartrain estuary. Robert W. Hastings provides a thorough examination of the historical and environmental research on the basin, with emphasis on its environmental degradation and the efforts to restore and protect this estuarine system. He also explores the current biological condition of the lakes.
Hastings begins with the geological formation of the lakes and the relationship between Native Americans and the water they referred to as Okwa'ta, the "wide water." From the historical period, he describes the forays of French explorer Pierre Le Moyne D'Iberville in 1699 and traces the environmental history of the basin through the development of the New Orleans metropolitan area. Using the lakes for transportation and then recreation, the surrounding population burgeoned, and this growth resulted in severe water pollution and other environmental problems. In the 1980s the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Foundation led a concerted drive to restore the lakes, an ongoing effort that has proved significant.

T1  - Thermal Adaptation:&nbsp;A Theoretical and Empirical Synthesis
AN  - 2131079787
AB  - Temperature impacts the behaviour, physiology and ecology of all organisms more than any other abiotic variable. In this book, the author draws on theory from the more general discipline of evolutionary ecology to foster a fresh approach toward a theory of thermal adaptation. -;Temperature profoundly impacts both the phenotypes and distributions of organisms. These thermal effects exert strong selective pressures on behaviour, physiology and life history when environmental temperatures vary over space and time. Despite temperature's significance, progress toward a quantitative theory of thermal adaptation has lagged behind empirical descriptions of patterns and processes. In this book, the author draws on theory from the more general discipline of. evolutionary ecology to establish a framework for interpreting empirical studies of thermal biology. This novel synthesis of theoretical and empirical work generates new insights about the process of thermal adaptation and points the way towards a more general theory. The threat of rapid climatic change on a. global scale provides a stark reminder of the challenges that remain for thermal biologists and adds a sense of urgency to this book's mission. Thermal Adaptation will benefit anyone who seeks to understand the relationship between environmental variation and phenotypic evolution. The book focuses on quantitative evolutionary models at the individual, population and community levels, and successfully integrates this theory with modern empirical approaches. By providing a synthetic overview of evolutionary thermal biology, this accessible text will appeal to both graduate students and established researchers in the fields of. comparative, ecological, and evolutionary physiology. It will also interest the broader audience of professional ecologists and evolutionary biologists who require a comprehensive review of this topic, as well as those researchers working on the applied problems of regional and global climate. change. -

T1  - Leeches as Sensor-bioindicators of River Contamination by PCBs
AN  - 1537544617
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the use of leeches of the genus Erpobdella as a means of assessing polychlorinated biphenyl contamination of watercourses. The River Skalice, heavily contaminated with PCBs, was selected as a model. The source of contamination was a road gravel processing factory in Rozmitál pod Tremsínem from which an estimated 1 metric ton of PCBs leaked in 1986. Levels of PCB were measured in leeches collected between 1992 to 2003 from 11 sites covering about 50 km of the river (the first sampling site upstream to the source of contamination and 10 sites downstream). The PCB indicator congeners IUPA no. 28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153, and 180 were measured. Levels were highest at the four sampling sites nearest the source of pollution. The highest values of PCB congeners were found in 1992. PCB content decreased from 1992 to 2003 and with distance from the source. The study indicated that leeches of the genus Erpobdella are a suitable bioindicator of contamination in the surface layer of river sediments.

T1  - Practical Hydroinformatics:&nbsp;Computational Intelligence and Technological Developments in Water Applications
AN  - 2148122908
AB  - Hydroinformatics is an emerging subject that is expected to gather speed, momentum and critical mass throughout the forthcoming decades of the 21st century. This book provides a broad account of numerous advances in that field - a rapidly developing discipline covering the application of information and communication technologies, modelling and computational intelligence in aquatic environments. A systematic survey, classified according to the methods used (neural networks, fuzzy logic and evolutionary optimization, in particular) is offered, together with illustrated practical applications for solving various water-related issues. These include, but are not limited to, flood estimation, rainfall-runoff modelling, rehabilitation of urban water networks, estimation of ocean temperature profiles, etc. Particular attention is also given to certain aspects of the most recent technological progress in hydroinformatics including the development of protocols for model integration and of computer architectures for modern modelling systems. Invited contributions were obtained from leading international experts - including academics, hydrological practitioners and industrial professionals - such that this edited volume constitutes an authoritative source of reference material and is essential reading for active workers in this field.Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras

T1  - Computing the Mind:&nbsp;How the Mind Really Works
AN  - 2130924420
AB  - In a culmination of humanity's millennia-long quest for self knowledge, the sciences of the mind are now in a position to offer concrete, empirically validated answers to the most fundamental questions about human nature. What does it mean to be a mind? How is the mind related to the brain? How are minds shaped by their embodiment and environment? What are the principles behind cognitive functions such as perception, memory, language, thought, and consciousness? By analyzing the tasks facing any sentient being that is subject to stimulation and a pressure to act, Shimon Edelman identifies computation as the common denominator in the emerging answers to all these questions. Any system composed of elements that exchange signals with each other and occasionally with the rest of the world can be said to be engaged in computation. A brain composed of neurons is one example of a system that computes, and the computations that the neurons collectively carry out constitute the brain's mind. Edelman presents a computational account of the entire spectrum of cognitive phenomena that constitutes the mind. He begins with sentience, and uses examples from visual perception to demonstrate that it must, at its very core, be a type of computation. Throughout his account, Edelman acknowledges the human mind's biological origins. Along the way, he also demystifies traits such as creativity, language, and individual and collective consciousness, and hints at how naturally evolved minds can transcend some of their limitations by moving to computational substrates other than brains. The account that Edelman gives in this book is accessible, yet unified and rigorous, and the big picture he presents is supported by evidence ranging from neurobiology to computer science. The book should be read by anyone seeking a comprehensive and current introduction to cognitive psychology.

T1  - Province's wildlife in all its glory
AN  - 439431773
AB  - So here's to old Queen Vic! Winter's past, the season of easy livin' looms and the great outdoors in a province of vast natural splendour beckons.                By the sounds of it, Noah's ark had nothing on us. From polar bears in the north to the blue racer snaking its way around Pelee Island, there are about 30,000 species of wildlife in Ontario, 180 of them identified as being at risk.                Ontario has been hit by numbers of invasive species - zebra mussels, purple loosestrife, gobies and other of Mother Nature's unruly offspring. In the Great Lakes alone there are more than 180 invasive species and two new ones arrive every year from the ballast water of ocean-going vessels.

T1  - A Model to Predict Total Chlorine Residue in the Cooling Seawater of a Power Plant Using Iodine Colorimetric Method
AN  - 1526055495
AB  - A model experiment monitoring the fate of total residue oxidant (TRO) in water at a constant temperature and salinity indicated that it decayed exponentially with time, and with TRO decaying faster in seawater than in distilled water. The reduction of TRO by temperature (°K) was found to fit a curvilinear relationship in distilled water (r2 = 0.997) and a linear relationship in seawater (r2 = 0.996). Based on the decay rate, flow rate, and the length of cooling water flowing through at a given temperature, the TRO level in the cooling water of a power plant could be estimated using the equation developed in this study. This predictive model would provide a benchmark for power plant operators to adjust the addition of chlorine to levels necessary to control bio-fouling of cooling water intake pipelines, but without irritating ambient marine organisms.

T1  - Global Environmental History:&nbsp;10,000 BC to AD 2000
AN  - 2131111323
AB  - Courses which deal with environmental history have long lacked a comprehensive overview. I. G. Simmons has made a significant contribution with a book that looks at the long-term history of environment and humanity from 10,000 BC to AD 2000. This far-reaching text considers the global picture and recognises the contributions of many disciplines including the natural sciences, the social sciences, and increasingly, the humanities.As a starting point, this book takes the major phases of human technological evolution of the last 12,000 years and considers how these have affected the natural world. It then considers the response to conditions such as climate change, putting today's preoccupations into a long-term perspective. This is a book of history, not prophecy, and so makes no judgements on current anxieties. Key features:*Includes a glossary of unfamiliar terms *Notable in being a history and not a polemic *Examines the interrelation of history and nature, drawing on many fields of learning *Extensive coverage makes this ideal background reading for more specialised treatments and studies

T1  - Help keep foreign species out of our lakes: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359449631
AB  - How do these invasive species spread so quickly? They spread through human activity. An angler fishes in a lake with zebra mussels. While loading his boat, some cling to the trailer. When he launches his boat back home, the mussels detach and spread into his home waters.

              
   To stop the spread of these dangerous plants and animals, follow these routines. Remove all visible plant or animal matter from your boat and trailer before leaving the launch area. Drain all the water from your boat, live wells, bilge and motor before relaunching your boat. Destroy organisms on your boat, waders, wading boots and other gear by leaving them in the sun for five days or spraying them with hot water or a mild bleach solution.

              
   I know that, when you read about invasive species, it seems like it is a battle that we cannot win. I believe we can win this battle. To do so, we must all make every effort to prevent the spread of these dangers to our waters. Rinse your boat carefully after fishing out of province. Dry out your wading boots completely after fishing away from Saskatchewan streams.

T1  - Cruise Ship Pollution
AN  - 2131304883
AB  - The cruise industry is a significant and growing contributor to the U.S. economy, providing more than $32 billion in benefits annually and generating more than 330,000 U.S. jobs, but also making the environmental impacts of its activities an issue to many. Although cruise ships represent a small fraction of the entire shipping industry worldwide, public attention to their environmental impacts comes in part from the fact that cruise ships are highly visible and in part because of the industry’s desire to promote a positive image. Cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers and crew have been compared to “floating cities,” and the volume of wastes that they produce is comparably large, consisting of sewage; wastewater from sinks, showers, and galleys (graywater); hazardous wastes; solid waste; oily bilge water; ballast water; and air pollution. The waste streams generated by cruise ships are governed by a number of international protocols (especially MARPOL) and U.S. domestic laws (including the Clean Water Act and the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships), regulations, and standards, but there is no single law or rule. Some cruise ship waste streams appear to be well regulated, such as solid wastes (garbage and plastics) and bilge water. But there is overlap of some areas, and there are gaps in others. Some, such as graywater and ballast water, are not regulated (except in the Great Lakes), and concern is increasing about the impacts of these discharges on public health and the environment. In other areas, regulations apply, but critics argue that they are not stringent enough to address the problem — for example, with respect to standards for sewage discharges. Environmental advocates have raised concerns about the adequacy of existing laws for managing these wastes, and they contend that enforcement is weak. In 2000, Congress enacted legislation restricting cruise ship discharges in U.S. navigable waters within the state of Alaska. California, Alaska, and Maine have enacted state-specific laws concerning cruise ship pollution, and a few other states have entered into voluntary agreements with industry to address management of cruise ship discharges. Meanwhile, the cruise industry has voluntarily undertaken initiatives to improve pollution prevention, by adopting waste management guidelines and procedures and researching new technologies. Concerns about cruise ship pollution raise issues for Congress in three broad areas: adequacy of laws and regulations, research needs, and oversight and enforcement of existing requirements. Legislation to regulate cruise ship discharges of sewage, graywater, and bilge water nationally has been introduced in the 110th Congress (S. 2881). This book describes the several types of waste streams that cruise ships may discharge and emit. It identifies the complex body of international and domestic laws that address pollution from cruise ships. It then describes federal and state legislative activity concerning cruise ships in Alaskan waters and activities in a few other states, as well as current industry initiatives to manage cruise ship pollution.

T1  - Protecting the Gulf's Marine Ecosystems from Pollution
AN  - 2131110544
AB  - The Gulf is endowed with valuable natural resources and a great biodiversity of plant and animal species. Sustainable living in the Gulf area is dependent upon such resources provided by the sea. Large areas of its coastal zone including important marine habitats are currently threatened by increasing stress on the Gulf ecosystem due to an accelerated coastal development during the last few years. Some of the world's largest landfill and dredging projects are found in the coastal areas, and the world's main crude oil shipping routes pass through the open sea. A variety of human impacts are contributing to marine pollution, such as oil, sediments, waste, thermal, chemical, and other forms of pollution. 
This volume reviews present sources and levels of pollution in the Gulf, assesses their causes and effects on biota and ecosystems, and identifies gaps and obstacles currently preventing an effective integrated transboundary management of the marine and coastal resources. It highlights preventive and remedial measures reducing levels of pollution and mitigating adverse impacts. 
The book is an important source of information for environmental managers, researchers, administrators, and decision makers, contributing towards an improved environmental management.

T1  - Integration of Information for Environmental Security:&nbsp;Environmental Security, Information Security, Disaster Forecast and Prevention, Water Resources Management
AN  - 2131358087
AB  - In case of security threats there is a need for temporal access to complete, updated, reliable information, in a dedicated form, is an essential prerequisite to effectively counter security threats. Currently the necessary information exists in a multitude of forms and formats geographically and physically scattered over different countries, institutes and organisations, and are subject to widely different data policies and management schemes. Moreover, there is no complete and updated overview of the existing information, e.g. in the form of a metadata catalogue. As a result, integration of this information in case of emergencies has proven to be extremely difficult, if not impossible. Although in some cases, interesting and impressive "demonstrations" have been shown of the possibilities of the integration of information, for a number of reasons these have reached the "operational" stage.

T1  - Ecological and Genetic Implications of Aquaculture Activities
AN  - 2134410193
AB  - Aquaculture is a rapidly growing industry and aquaculture practices can directly interact with and depend upon the surrounding environment. Therefore, the effects of all types of aquaculture on living natural resources and ecosystems are of significant and increasing national and international interest. In Ecological and Genetic Implications of Aquaculture Activities, numerous nationally and internationally prominent aquaculture researchers contribute 27 chapters that comprise overviews of aquaculture effects on the environment, discussions of genetic considerations, thorough documentation of aquaculture effects and their solutions specific to countries, and approaches toward environmentally sustainable aquaculture. Together, these chapters comprise a comprehensive synthesis of many ecological and genetic problems implicated in the practice of aquaculture and of many proven, attempted, or postulated solutions to those problems. Many chapters can serve as benchmark documentations ofspecific aquaculture effects on biodiversity at different levels. The authorship is broadly international; the authors represent 18 different countries or international agencies and all continents except Antarctica. The aquaculture effects and their solutions range from local to global and simple to highly technical. Effects common to many levels and types of aquaculture emerge, as well as both common and unique solutions. 
Aquaculturists, aquaculture researchers, aquaculture industry developers, conservation biologists, environmental scientists, resource managers, and policy makers should find this book interesting and informative.Provides detailed descriptions of proven novel and interesting solutions to common aquaculture problems Provides worldwide overviews of major environmental and/or genetic effects of aquaculture An outstanding source of references for all types of aquaculture activities and all types of ecological and genetic effects that result from the practice of aquaculture

T1  - Shallow Lakes in a Changing World:&nbsp;Proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes, Held at Dalfsen, the Netherlands, 5-9 June 2005
AN  - 2130973822
AB  - Since the late 1980s, shallow lakes in Europe and North America have been receiving concerted attention from limnologists, fishery biologists and lake managers. These developments relate to deterioration of water quality in the lakes due to pollution and accelerated eutrophication, caused by increased urbanization and agriculture in the lake catchments, overexploitation of fish and higher water level fluctuations. The water-quality and management problems of lakes have led to a greater need for fundamental researches on shallow lakes in order to gain a deeper insight into the structure and functioning of the food web in these waters. New knowledge relating to littoral-pelagial interactions and the sediment-water interface has facilitated the development of new lake restoration techniques. 
This volume, with 41 peer-reviewed papers, comprises the proceedings of the 5th International Symposium on Shallow Lakes, which was held at Dalfsen, The Netherlands, on 5-9 June 2005. It has the theme Shallow Lakes in a Changing World and deals with water-quality issues, such as changes in lake limnology, especially those driven by eutrophication and pollution, increased nutrient loading and productivity, perennial blooms of cyanobacteria and loss of biodiversity. The general consensus is that the lakes under restoration respond by showing an increase in water clarity followed by an increase in macrophyte coverage and biomass. Consequently, there is now ground for theoretical speculations on the so-called 'alternate stable states' observed in many such lakes under restoration.Supplements and updates the issues related to eutrophication and pollution problems regarding many shallow lakes in Europe and North America Contains state-of-the art updates on water quality issues and different restoration techniques

T1  - River Science at the U. S. Geological Survey
AN  - 2131953239
AB  - Rivers provide about 60 percent of the nation's drinking water and irrigation water and 10 percent of the nation's electric power needs. The multiple and sometimes incompatible services demanded of rivers often lead to policy and management conflicts that require the integration of science-based information. This report advises the U.S. Geological Survey on how it can best address river science challenges by effectively using its resources and coordinating its activities with other agencies. The report identifies the highest priority river science issues for the USGS, including environmental flows and river restoration, sediment transport and geomorphology, and groundwater surface-water interactions. It also recommends two cross-cutting science activities including surveying and mapping the nation's river systems according to key physical and landscape features, and expanding work on predictive models, especially those that simulate interactions between physical-biological processes. The report identifies key variables to be monitored and data-managed. It proposes enhancements in streamflow, biological, and sediment monitoring; these include establishing multidisciplinary, integrated reach-scale monitoring sites and developing a comprehensive national sediment monitoring program. Finally, it encourages the USGS to be at the forefront of new technology application, including airborne lidar and embedded, networked, wireless sensors.

T1  - Ecotoxicology, Ecological Risk Assessment and Multiple Stressors
AN  - 2130966465
AB  - The interaction between environment and health is far more complex than is commonly understood. In particular, little attention has been paid to the interaction of different pollutants in the human body as well as in the environment. Even low level exposure over a period of time to a complex cocktail of pollutants in air, water, food and consumer products is likely to contribute significantly to the health status of European citizens. This volume represents new knowledge both on human and environmental risk assessment procedures and although it is generally acknowledged that chemical, biological, radiological, and other stressors can cause a variety of human health or ecological health effects, assessing the risks associated with them is considerably more complex methodologically and computationally than current risk assessment practices. This book is designed to reduce the uncertainty in our current knowledge of ecotoxicology. The four basic topics it embraces are The Science of Ecotoxicology, Ecological Risk Assessment and Multiple Stressors, Methods and Tools in Ecotoxicology and Ecological Risk Assessment and Ecotoxicology and Toxicity Monitoring.

T1  - The Quest for Food:&nbsp;A Natural History of Eating
AN  - 2148119513
AB  - The Quest for Food: A Natural History of Eating is a collection of essays that surveys eating through time, from the perspective of a biologist. 
The quest begins in prehistoric times with religion and the exploration of the connection between food and sex. This leads to an investigation of the deep links between food and culture, exploring the basic question of "what is eating?" The second section embarks on a biochemistry-oriented journey tracing the path of a food molecule through the central carbon pathway until it is decomposed into CO2, H2O and ATP. The third section delves into the evolution of eating systems, beginning with the elements of the primordial soup through the birth of single cell organisms such as bacteria and archea. We then follow this evolution in the fourth section through higher developed organisms: from the first organisms in the ocean to the ones on land. The next two sections explore the stories of food from an ecological, then behavioral viewpoint, leading the reader from animals to early hominids, and into human history. The final section takes apart an anthropocentric view of the world by presenting man as prey for the oldest predators: microbes. The text closes with an agronomical outlook on how to feed the billions. 
The goal of The Quest for Food is to catalyze discussions between scientists working in food science, and those in biological and biomedical research. 
  
About the Author: 
Harald Brüssow is a Senior Research Scientist at Nestle Research Centre's Nutritional Health Department, in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Through a series of essays concerning human eating seen from the perspective of contemporary biology / medicine and recent research articles, the book explores the links between food and Man's cultural and physical evolution. Each chapter has an introduction summarizing the basic knowledge in the field, discusses the recent research results, and confirms or challenges the established concepts, which opens new aspects and leads to new questions. 
This book catalyzes discussion between scientists working on one side in food
Provides a discussion platform for scientists working on one side in food science and on the other side in biological and biomedical research

T1  - Will shrimp make trouble in Great Lakes?; Tiny new critter found in Lake Ontario has the potential to upset food chain: [MET Edition]
AN  - 439133659
AB  - The Great Lakes are once more being threatened by another invasive species - a half-inch-long shrimp from Eurasia that has made its way to Lake Ontario and could threaten the lake's food chain.                 The tiny critter, called the bloody red mysid, was found in a sample taken near Oswego, east of Rochester, last spring, said Chuck O'Neill, an invasive species expert with New York Sea Grant, a U.S. environmental research institute.                 The creature's nocturnal habits may explain why it hasn't been found elsewhere in the lakes yet, said Steve Pothoven, a fishery biologist at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab, part of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

T1  - Controls on phytoplankton physiology in Lake Ontario during the late summer: evidence from new fluorescence methods
AN  - 219348451
AB  - Fast repetition rate fluorescence (FRRF) and spectral fluorescence, together with measures of nutrients and pigments, were used to characterize the composition and photosynthetic physiology of Lake Ontario phytoplankton in late summer and relate them to environmental conditions. Two stations demonstrated effects from relatively heavy anthropogenic disturbance and showed that the response of phytoplankton physiology to different impacts is highly variable. Other stations were more similar in phytoplankton composition, and in situ fluorescence yields (F'^sub q^/F'^sub m^) in the lower surface mixed layer suggested good physiological condition (0.45-0.50). Nutrient ratios and mean irradiance indicated a general state of light saturation and slight phosphorus (P) deficiency, but physiological variations among stations were unrelated to measures of P deficiency. Fluorescence yields often decreased when surface layer samples were held in the dark, consistent with an induction of chlororespiration and prior exposure to supersaturating levels of irradiance. Comparative estimates of photosynthesis by FRRF and ^sup 14^C revealed disparities suggestive of substantial differences between in situ and incubation methods, while spectral fluorescence appeared to underestimate cyanobacterial abundance. FRRF parameters, particularly F'^sub q^/F'^sub m^, were effective in identifying higher-impact stations and showed promise as an efficient means of characterizing variations in phytoplankton condition that may underlie phenomena such as taste and odour production.

T1  - Introduction to Biosemiotics:&nbsp;The New Biological Synthesis
AN  - 2132042238
AB  - This book is addressed to students, researchers and academics who have barely heard of the emerging young science of Biosemiotics, and who want to know more about it. Written by many of the field's major contributors, it provides a highly qualified introduction to Biosemiotics and illustrates the most recent views in its background and development. 
Combining research approaches from biology, philosophy and linguistics, the field of Biosemiotics proposes that animals, plants and single cells all engage in semiosis - the conversion of objective signals into conventional signs. This has important implications and applications for issues ranging from natural selection to animal behavior and human psychology, leaving biosemiotics at the cutting edge of the research on the fundamentals of life. 
Drawing on an international expertise, the book details the history and study of biosemiotics, and provides a state-of-the-art summary of the current work in this new field. And, with relevance to a wide range of disciplines - from linguistics and semiotics to evolutionary phenomena and the philosophy of biology - the book provides an important text for both students and established researchers, while marking a vital step in the evolution of a new biological paradigm. 
Marcello Barbieri is University Professor of Embryology at the University of Ferrara, Italy, President of the Italian Association for Theoretical Biology and Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Biosemiotics.Biosemiotics is the Third Culture providing a bridge between Sciences and Humanities Key idea of Biosemiotics is that the existence of genetic code requires both concept of biological information and biological meaning Strong attack on doctrine of physicalism that the concept of meaning does not belong to Life Sciences First comprehensive introduction to new Biosemiotics Science All leading biosemioticians have contributed Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras
MARCELLO BARBIERI is University professor of Embryology at the University of Ferrara, Italy. He has conducted research on embryonic development and ribosome crystallization at the Medical Research Council in Cambridge, UK, the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, USA, and the Max-Planck-Institut für Molekulare Genetik in Berlin.

T1  - Timing of Hexagenia (Ephemeridae: Ephemeroptera) mayfly swarms
AN  - 220489260
AB  - Although degree-days can be used to determine when insect emergence begins, peak swarming events in species that exhibit extended emergence periods are difficult to estimate. With the aid of logistic regression, we estimated the probability of adult mayfly swarms (≥50 individuals/m^sup 2^), occurring on any given night in western Lake Erie, using meteorological data. We sampled adult Hexagenia Walsh, 1863 from 2130 (sunset) to 2300 on 18 dates in 2000 (2 June - 18 July), with the largest numbers retrieved between 13 June and 2 July. Water temperature (20 °C) was the cue to the onset of swarming (subimagos). Highest mean (±SE) density of all Hexagenia adults (subimagos and imagos) was 24 740 ± 8 757 individuals/m^sup 2^. Overall, 10-fold more imagos (mostly females) than subimagos were attracted to lights. Of the factors examined (air and water temperature, Julian day, dew point, heat index, humidity, moon phase, wind chill, wind direction, wind speed), onshore wind speed (0-9.2 km/h) on calendar dates for which the water temperature exceeded 20 °C was the most significant factor to account for total adult swarms. Eighty-three percent of the 18 swarming events observed in 2000 were correctly predicted. Validity of the model was confirmed with data collected in 2002, during which 5 of 6 swarming events were correctly predicted from the logistic model. Wind promotes adult aggregation at the land-water interface, the effect of which facilitates mating success and predator swamping. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Lakes face new threat: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 439027639
AB  - Given this growing threat, it is troubling that Ottawa has watered down new rules governing ballast water on ships travelling into the lakes, exempting many from measures aimed at keeping invasive species out.                 Draft rules proposed last year by Ottawa would have forced all ships entering the lakes from foreign waters to flush their ballast tanks at sea, getting rid of any invasive organisms.                 Although these ships do not require ballast, they often carry residual water in their ballast tanks that can harbour aquatic organisms. They can release foreign species as they load and unload cargo around the lakes.

T1  - BARC official sets sail on new career with local Port Authority: [Final Edition]
AN  - 345737269
AB  - Ms. [Marilyn Baxter], who has served with the Bay Area Restoration Council (BARC) for 13 years, said HPA officials provided her with was an opportunity should couldn't ignore.

              
   Ms. Baxter said for the last year the process has been held up because the design for the capping on the 12 acre parcel of land just off the shore of Stelco was being drawn up and overseen by Environment Canada. Now that it is near completion, the logjam seems to be releasing. The environmental assessment can begin, and the financial partners, including Stelco, and the Port Authority can find out how much it will cost to complete the project.

              
   Other priorities on her environment list include getting the Hamilton Harbour de-listed as an Area of Concern from the International Joint Commission's "hot spot" list, and establishing proper clean-up protocols for ocean-going ships to prevent further invasive species from invading the harbour. Already the harbour is home to the zebra mussel and gobie fish, deposited into the Great Lakes from ocean-going ships' ballasts.

T1  - Flora, fauna in jeopardy; Scientists report frightening forecasts Cite human need for biodiverse world: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 439013573
AB  - Population growth and expansion of such industries as farming and logging destroy forests - three-quarters of Earth's original tree cover is gone - as well as wetlands, grasslands and other important habitat, it notes. Globalization and carelessness spread invasive species that wipe out local populations. Climate change is beginning to take a toll.                 As a result, the report states "Some 12 per cent of all bird species, 23 per cent of mammals, 25 per cent of pine and other conifer trees, 32 per cent of amphibians and 52 per cent of cycads (ancient tropical plants) are currently threatened with extinction, and climate change alone might commit an additional 15 to 37 per cent ... to premature extinction within the next 50 years."                 A study released this week shows an impact close to home. The number of known invasive species in the Great Lakes has climbed to 182, and a new one is discovered, on average, every 28 weeks - the highest rate in any freshwater area on Earth, says Anthony Ricciardi, of McGill University's school of environment in Montreal.

T1  - Partial Order in Environmental Sciences and Chemistry
AN  - 2132032862
AB  - Partial Order? - Never heard of it!
 This comment will be heard no more, when the broadness of this mathematical concept has been explained. Many internationally renowned authors assist the reader in understanding what partial order is and where, why and how this concept can be used. Since all the authors have teaching experience, partial order is explained step by step. Mathematical formalism is avoided as far as ever possible. The book begins with some basics, considers applications in different fields and ends with some historical notes.
 After reading this book, the comment should become: Partial order! - Where is the next book?A primer in a mathematical technique which is useful in many expanding disciplines, like genomics, techniques of decision support, and sustainability
Rainer Brüggemann studied chemistry at the Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich. He received his PhD in 1977.

T1  - Ecology for Millions
AN  - 2131775988
AB  - Today, as never before, the application of knowledge of Ecology in our everyday life has become of paramount importance. Our very survival depends on these. Most of us are however blissfully unaware of the looming environmental catastrophe, though, the cliche words like ecosystem, sustainable development, and ecotourism are flying about. Few are really conscious about the logistics and the energy required to put ecological knowledge into practice. The aim of this small book is to bring within the reach of educated laymen, both the science as well as the philosophy of Ecology in simple and non-technical English. The first seven chapters of the book explain in simple English, with minimum technicalities, the basic principles of ecology and how the animals and the plants of the entire world are mutually dependant for their survival and flourishing. The eighth chapter gives some kaleidoscopic glimpses of the beauties of the various ecosystems on Earth?s surface, and how the animals and plants of each ecosystem are beautifully adapted to suit the specific demands of each of them. The last two chapters i.e., ninth and tenth have been devoted to outline, how owing to the insatiable greed and anthropocentric attitude of Homo Sapiens, the green envelope of our Mother Earth is being wrecked everywhere with painful consequences?

T1  - An evaluation of stable nitrogen isotopes and polychlorinated biphenyls as bioenergetic tracers in aquatic systems
AN  - 219347028
AB  - This study investigated the relationship between stable nitrogen isotopes (δ^sup 15^N) and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris) and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) with respect to age, size, and diet. δ^sup 15^N signatures in both species exhibited enrichment with increasing size and approached steady state with respect to dietary δ^sup 15^N values by the second year of growth. Young-of-the-year fish, however, exhibited lower nitrogen isotope enrichment over the diet, indicating that the commonly held trophic enrichment factor of 3.4[per thousand] is more suitable for older, slow-growing individuals. PCB accumulation in both species progressed from being dominated by uptake from water in small (<100 g) fish to dietary uptake in larger individuals as a function of bioenergetic constraints such as food energy conversion and contaminant assimilation efficiencies. Significant increases in PCB accumulation were attributed to decreased specific growth rates such that ≤60% of body mass was gained on an annual basis. This effect was most noted in bluegills where higher PCB biomagnification factors were a consequence of increased foraging costs associated with an invertebrate diet. It is concluded that growth-related changes in species bioenergetics regulate both contaminant accumulation and δ^sup 15^N dynamics. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Complexity in Landscape Ecology
AN  - 2131802665
AB  - Interactions matter. To understand the distributions of plants and animals in a landscape you need to understand how they interact with each other, and with their environment. The resulting networks of interactions make ecosystems highly complex. Recent research on complexity and artificial life provides many new insights about patterns and processes in landscapes and ecosystems. This book provides the first overview of that work for general readers. It covers such topics as connectivity, criticality, feedback, and networks, as well as their impact on the stability and predictability of ecosystem dynamics. With over 60 years of research experience of both ecology and complexity, the authors are uniquely qualified to provide a new perspective on traditional ecology. They argue that understanding ecological complexity is crucial in today's globalized and interconnected world. Successful management of the world's ecosystems needs to combine models of ecosystem complexity with biodiversity, environmental, geographic and socioeconomic information.Combines ecology, landscapes and complexity Outlines a new framework for understanding complex ecological systems in landscapes Pitched at the general reader unlike other accounts of this area

T1  - Persistent Organic Pollutants in the Great Lakes
AN  - 2136209794
AB  - The environment around the Laurentian Great Lakes region has been adversely affected by agricultural runoff, urban waste, industrial discharge, landfill leachate, and atmospheric deposition. Although there have been some improvements over the last 20 years, persistent toxic organic pollutants are now a serious problem. This book brings together what is known about the major classes of these pollutants in the Great Lakes. Each chapter reviews our knowledge of the extent of contamination of the various parts of the Great Lakes ecosystem (air, water, sediment, fishes, birds, etc.), what is known about the trends over time of this contamination, and knowledge about the mechanisms by which these pollutants are mobilized in the lakes. Detailed information is presented on polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans, pesticides, toxaphene, polychlorinated naphthalenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, brominated flame retardants, and perfluoroalkyl acids. These reviews make this volume an invaluable resource for all those involved in environmental research, measurements, and decision making.

T1  - Ontario's unwelcome visitors: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 438935794
AB  - Fanwort invaded Ontario's lakes following much the same route taken by many invasive species. And, like other more famous aliens, such as the drain-clogging zebra mussels and the blood-sucking sea lamprey, this otherwise harmless little plant can wreak havoc outside its native environment.                 Several large organizations are devoted to tackling the problem, including the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources. One of the most helpful to us was the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters. A staffer had plied the actual lake in question in a canoe a year ago and pronounced it pristine - so far. Alas, our little dream lake was connected to another badly infected larger lake upstream, raising the prospect that only time stood between us and the inevitable invasion.                 Still, we fear the small caution sign at the public boat launch, advising owners to inspect their boat hulls before entering the lake, is not much of a deterrent to people unfamiliar with risks to Ontario's 250,000 freshwater lakes. The ministry and the anglers run education programs and maintain a hotline that tracks reports of new sightings.

T1  - The Environment in Asia Pacific Harbours
AN  - 2131360269
AB  - Urbanization has already reached unprecedented levels in the estuarine and coastal zone of the Asia Pacific region where mega-cities and mega-harbours have developed and are still growing. Environmental degradation is significant and growing. The social, economic and environmental problems are pressing and call for science-based solutions. This book details how science can provide solutions so that economic and social developments can be ecologically sustainable. Twelve sites are discussed in detail, integrating physics and biology, and between science and engineering. In turn these are linked to economic and social issues. These sites are Tokyo Bay, the Pearl Estuary, Hong Kong, Shanghai and the Yangtze delta, Klang, Manila Bay, Jakarta Bay, Pearl Harbor, Ho Chi Minh City, Bangkok and the upper Gulf of Thailand, Singapore, and Darwin. This is the shoreline of about 50 million people and the coastal waters of about 500 million people. Sixty prominent scientists and engineers in universities and research centres in all these cities contributed the chapters in this book. 
These lessons are fundamentally important for the Asia Pacific region, and they will also substantially inform similar analyses of mega-cities, port and harbour management and practices worldwide.Shows significance and growth of environmental degradation in the Asia Pacific region Shows the balance between economy, social issues, public health and marine environment for people living near coastlines and in their watershed Shows solutions and pitfalls in managing environment in mega-harbours and cities Shows how physical processes exert influence on biological processes in urbanised waters Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extrasDr. Eric Wolanski, an internationally recognized coastal oceanographer, is a fellow of the Belgian Academy of Overseas Sciences, the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, and the Institution of Engineers Australia. He was awarded an Australian Centenary medal for services in estuarine and coastal oceanography and he is a Leading Scientist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science with more than 270 publications.

T1  - Ban ocean ships from Great Lakes to fight invasive species: professor: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349617379
AB  - WINDSOR - Costs of fighting invasive species dragged and dumped into the Great Lakes by ocean ships are up to 10 times greater than transportation savings created by using international vessels to ship cargo through the waters, says a Michigan university study.

              
   His report, Ocean Shipping in the Great Lakes, has identified annual transportation savings of $54.9 million US through the use of ocean ships passing through the St. Lawrence Seaway into ports such as Windsor, Chicago, Cleveland, Hamilton and Milwaukee.

              
   About 70 per cent of invasive species in the Great Lakes region come from ocean ships, said biologist Hugh MacIsaac, head of the University of Windsor's Great Lakes Institute for Environmental Research.

T1  - Boat hauls in valuable catch of information: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349090572
AB  - Similar conditions have pestered the vessel's crew since they set out in northern Lake Huron in mid-September from the vessel's home port of Cheboygan, Mich. Although further survey work remains in eastern and northern sectors of the lake, [Jeff Schaeffer] has begun drawing preliminary conclusions.

              
   The decline of alewife and a resurgence in native species has opened the door to a potential future for Lake Huron which no one has seriously considered until now, Schaeffer said. It's the idea that environmental planners can now begin to think of the restoration, rather than simply the rehabilitation, of fish habitat.

T1  - The importance of microzooplankton versus phytoplankton to copepod populations during late winter and early spring in Lake Michigan
AN  - 219309516
AB  - Feeding rates of the calanoid copepod Leptodiaptomus sicilis on natural assemblages of phytoplankton and microzooplankton were evaluated during late winter and early spring in Lake Michigan. Microzooplankton were the preferred food source for this copepod, and larger size fractions of phytoplankton were preferred to smaller size fractions. Ingestion rates of total chlorophyll a ranged from 2 to 14 ng.copepod^sup -1^.day^sup -1^, while ingestion rates of microzooplankton biomass ranged from 0.04 to 0.15 µg C.copepod^sup -1^.day^sup -1^. In these experiments, microzooplankton carbon accounted for 22%-74% of the total carbon ingested. Clearance rates of microzooplankton carbon were positively related to the larger size fractions of chlorophyll a and to total suspended solids. Measured ingestion rates of microzooplankton and phytoplankton carbon suggest that calanoid copepod populations have the potential to control microzooplankton production in late winter and early spring, and even with an abundance of phytoplankton carbon, food availability may limit the reproduction of L. sicilis. Because microzooplankton contribute significantly to the diet of these copepods, stimulation of the microbial food web by terrigenous inputs of nutrients and carbon may be transmitted to higher trophic levels (i.e., mesozooplankton and their predators) through heterotrophic flagellates and protozoans.

T1  - Oceans and Health::&nbsp;Pathogens in the Marine Environment
AN  - 2133164277
AB  - The release of non-disinfected wastewaters into the marine environment is a common practice all around the world. Consequently, the seas are constantly infused with wastewater bacteria, among them highly pathogenic ones. In view of the public health significance of this phenomenon, it is surprising how little is actually known concerning the fate of such bacteria once they enter the sea. This book therefore looks at the survival, infectivity, pathogenicity and viability of enteric bacteria in the sea. Chapters also detail the public health aspects of wastewater release, civil engineering and economic considerations, other sources of pathogens, and much more.

T1  - The Northwest Passage
AN  - 220848308
AB  - The first conceptual framework, which I call the "sovereignty first and foremost" school, assumes that Canada's sovereignty is tied directly to the ice. Franklyn Griffiths refers to this as the "sovereignty on thinning ice" theory.' According to this way of thinking, any solutions or suggestions regarding the passage must have as their end objective the solidification of Canada's total legal control. The second framework, the "sovereignty to one side" framework, holds the sovereignty issue constant, as it were, in order to concentrate on the more practical issues associated with an ice-free passage such as protecting the environment, ensuring the security of Canada and the North American continent, facilitating navigation, breaking ice, harvesting and protecting raw materials and resources, and monitoring and enforcing national and international laws. This school of thought believes sovereignty is important. However, rather than being tangled in a legal imbroglio, proponents of this school prefer to "put sovereignty to the side" while they tackle other, related issues.              The difficulty one has outlining the sovereignty first and foremost framework is that, while its advocates are very vocal and urgent in their pleas, their policies are rather elusive. Continued insistence that the passage is within Canada's historic internal waters may not be sufficient. Therefore, I will use Franklyn Griffith's critique of the "alarmist" view to describe the sovereignty first and foremost school of thought. His article, "The shipping news, Canada's arctic sovereignty not on thinning ice,"8 is largely a rebuttal to his "former self" in which he admittedly provided the trumpet from which to sound the alarm. As Griffiths once declared himself alarmist, his critique is very instructive.              According to Griffiths, the alarmists are the "southern Canadians" who insist on exaggerating the threat global warming poses to Canada's legal claim of the Northwest Passage. Furthermore, they perpetuate a "sovereignty-on-thinning-ice thesis" via three fallacies: rapidly decreasing ice conditions, a new and large commercial shipping interest, and the worsening of Canada-US relations.9 With the recent research from the Canadian arctic shelf exchange study (CASES)10 and the recent arctic climate impact assessment (ACAI) study" seemingly confirming some of the alarmists' predictions, the bureaucrats, in Griffiths' opinion, are rushing to put together an ill-conceived plan to establish Canada's hold on the passage once and for all. Griffiths contends that the alarmists have made the ultimate slippery slope argument, equating thinning ice to loss of sovereignty. In other words, the argument is that Canada is peering over a dangerous precipice so it is better to act hurriedly than not to act at all. Their position, according to Griffiths, can be summarized as follows.

T1  - Toxicity and bioaccumulation of tributyltin in Hyalella azteca from freshwater harbour sediments in the Great Lakes Basin, Canada
AN  - 219292707
AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the risk that tributyltin (TBT) levels in harbour sediments pose to the freshwater invertebrate Hyalella azteca and to rank TBT as an environmental concern compared with inorganic metal species. Four-week toxicity tests and 2-week bioaccumulation tests were conducted with sediments collected from five harbours historically contaminated with TBT: Montreal, Kingston, Toronto, Hamilton, and Port Weller. While there was no observable effect of TBT on survival or growth of H. azteca, bioaccumulation of TBT exceeded levels expected to cause chronic toxicity in some sediments from Kingston, Montreal, and Port Weller. There was a positive relationship between TBT in H. azteca and TBT in sediments (r^sup 2^ = 0.72), although TBT in field sediments was less bioavailable than in laboratory-spiked sediments. Body concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, nickel, and thallium were well below levels expected to cause toxicity in H. azteca. However, overlying water concentrations of copper and zinc approached or exceeded levels of concern in Toronto, Hamilton, and Port Weller sediments. This research suggests that levels of TBT in harbour sediments may cause chronic toxicity to H. azteca and freshwater invertebrate species of similar sensitivity and that copper and zinc also pose a risk at these sites.

T1  - Invasive species: the bullies of the plant world: [Final Edition]
AN  - 354817348
AB  - All around the lot where I live, European buckthorn (a shrub or small tree) is thriving. New trunks seem to sprout from the dense clumps of buckthorn all the time, each new shoot reaching farther than the last to get out from under the shade of its siblings. Together they form such a dense cover that almost nothing is able to grow on the forest floor beneath it, not poplar, birch, alder, pine, cedar or even forest wildflowers like trilliums and trout lily.

              
   Who can blame the buckthorn for fighting back, though? It was a case of one invasive species against another. Peterborough Green- Up's fact-sheet on invasive species describes these "bullies of the plant world" as plants that spread so well "they choke out native plants, reducing biodiversity and destroying habitat." Sounds like us European settlers, doesn't it, if you broaden the conversation to include animals? Just ask an aboriginal person.

              
   Not only are human beings the most invasive species of all, we're also the ones responsible for bringing the rest of the invaders here in the first place. Many of the plants we brought over, also known as aliens or exotics, get along quite well with the native species. It's the aggressive ones we have to look out for. They tend to take over in disturbed or stressed sites -- the edges of road or building construction, vacant lots, or abandoned marginal farmland.

T1  - Transboundary Water Resources: Strategies for Regional Security and Ecological Stability
AN  - 2132050051
AB  - After the sovjet era and since their independence the new Central Asian countries are rebuilding a system of water resources management: an important challenge for the development of the whole region. The NATO workshop held on 25-27 August 2003 by the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, Germany and the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science, attended by experts from five Central Asian countries, Russia, six Western European countries, the US and the UNEP offered water engineers and nature scientists as well as economic and political scientists and practitioners from water administrations and international river commissions to meet in Novosibirsk and develop sustainable approaches in the management of Central Asian water resources. 
This book presents important aspects of transboundary water resources, i.e. the global water crisis: problems and perspectives; regional experiences in solving water problems in Central Asia; problems and management of transboundary water resources; ecological and economic aspects of water management; scientific analysis and tools of water changes; strategic implications of water access arisen during the workshop. 
A final recommendation in the area of equitable sharing of benefits, monitoring and data collection as well as proposals for Central Asia transboundary waters programme were set in the book as the main result of the meeting.

T1  - Essentials of Medical Geology:&nbsp;Impacts of the Natural Environment on Public Health
AN  - 2131416706
AB  - This authoritative reference volume emphasizes the importance and interrelationships of geological processes to the health and diseases of humans and animals. Its accessible format fosters better communication between the health and geoscience communities by elucidating the geologic origins and flow of toxic elements in the environment that lead to human exposure through the consumption of food and water. For example, problems of excess intake from drinking water have been encountered for several inorganic compounds, including fluoride in Africa and India; arsenic in certain areas of Argentina, Chile, and Taiwan; selenium in seleniferous areas in the U.S., Venezuela, and China; and nitrate in agricultural areas with heavy use of fertilizers. Environmental influences on vector borne diseases and stormflow water quality influences are also featured. Numerous examples of the environmental influences on human health from across the globe are also presented and discussed in this volume. * Covers recent advances and future research topics at the intersection of environmental science and public health* Developed by 60 experts from 20 countries and edited by professionals from the International Working Group on Medical Geology* Includes 200+ color photographs and illustrations* Organizes information in a highly structured format for easy reference* Written for a broad audience, ranging from students, researchers, and medical professionals to policymakers and the general public

T1  - Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of Nephrops norvegicus / Merluccius merluccius fishing grounds in the Bay of Biscay (Northeast Atlantic)
AN  - 219352717
AB  - The trophic structure of the benthic ecosystem of the Grande Vasière (Great Mud Bank), a heavily trawled area in the Bay of Biscay, is largely unknown. To better understand the biotic interactions between exploited species (mainly Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus, and European hake, Merluccius merluccius) and their competitors and prey, we applied a dual stable carbon (^sup 13^C/^sup 12^C) and nitrogen (^sup 15^N/^sup 14^N) isotope analysis to determine trophic levels and differences in the potential food sources of species in the benthic and demersal communities. Five main groups of species constitute the basis of the trophic structure. They are distributed in three main trophic levels: primary consumers; secondary consumers including N. norvegicus and juvenile M. merluccius; and top predators including adult M. merluccius (δ^sup 15^N = 14.5[per thousand]). The large differences in δ^sup 13^C values within the primary consumers attest to two different food components: a pelagic component composed of fresh sedimenting paniculate organic matter, which mainly supplies supra- and epi-benthic suspension feeders, and zooplankton, and a benthic component, which mainly supplies deposit feeders. For the predators, the target species, and their competitors, diet changes during the life-span are reflected by differences in isotope values for the size classes. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

It discusses the challenges facing IREM by examining issues such as conflict, property rights and the role of science in the management of natural resource. It also addresses the definition and application of IREM from several different contexts, including real-world applications, planning frameworks, and complex systems. It provides a comprehensive aid in natural resource decision-making within the context of the real world.

T1  - Jury still out on walleyes' decline in Kawarthas: [Final Edition]
AN  - 267082816
AB  - The plummeting numbers are no more evident than in Rice Lake at the lower part of the chain. Ministry of Natural Resources' statistics show that the number of 14-inch fish has dropped from 200,000 to 100,000 over the last four years. And while short-term declines can be common in nature, this is not the case in Rice Lake or the rest of the Kawarthas for that matter.                 The jury is still out on this, but there is a theory or two that deserves a closer look. Many biologists think the decline in the walleye numbers is due in part to the colonization of zebra mussels in the chain of lakes that started in the early 1990s. The filter- feeding mussels, an alien from Asia's Caspian Sea introduced to Canada through ship ballast water, have increased water clarity in the Kawarthas making them less productive for walleye.                 Are they eating too many young walleye and eggs? The consensus is yes, but no one knows for sure yet. There is no doubt about the toll taken on the walleye population by pike though. A recent and unwanted introduction to the Kawarthas, pike feed on walleye and also compete with the resident muskie population.

T1  - E. coli levels are low: [Final Edition]
AN  - 354614515
AB  - "At 20 parts per billion of phosphorus, you get algae and weed growth," said [Jim Keyser]. "With the introduction of zebra mussels to the system, much of the algae was eaten, but the phosphorus stayed around."

              
   According to the report, algae that is not eaten by the mussels falls to the bottom of the lake and acts as fertilizer for aquatic weeds. When it is eaten by the mussels, it makes the water more clear and provides more light to the weeds, said Keyser.

              
   Anyone with lakefront property who is interested in participating in this year's E. coli, phosphorus, weed growth and the newly initiated benthic bug research should contact Keyser at 705-654- 3839

T1  - What lurks below?; Under the surface Lake Scugog is a fascinating place: [Final Edition]
AN  - 362222914
AB  - Joining them beneath the surface are Lake Scugog veterans such as large-mouth, small-mouth and rock bass, along with others such as pumpkin seed and perch, whose numbers dwindled in recent years because of disease but are "making a come back," says Rev. Beaton.

              
   "Blue gill are a relatively new species in Scugog and zebra mussels and black crappie have made their way into the lake in the last five years or so," says Rev. Beaton. "They weren't introduced by humans, they've just moved up through the lakes and rivers and they ended up here... Lake Scugog is kind of the end of the road for them. We're at the end. We just got them, while others have had them for years."

              
   Muskrats and beaver call Lake Scugog home and they're also joined by larger creatures such as bears, deer and even moose, says Rev. Beaton.

T1  - Environmentalists fear widening of St. Lawrence Seaway: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359458207
AB  - MONTREAL - The head of the American portion of the St. Lawrence Seaway says environmentalists are misleading and premature to denounce a potential widening of the inland waterway.                 [Albert Jacquez] and Canadian Richard Corfe, chief executive of the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corp., declined to give their opinions on enlarging the seaway.                 Opponents fear larger ocean-going ships would introduce foreign species into the Great Lakes, like the zebra mussels from the Caspian Sea that first appeared in the lakes in 1988. The mussels clog water pipes and attach themselves to ships and docks.

T1  - Walleyes threatened by invading species: [Final Edition]
AN  - 267054296
AB  - Big bass and close finishes were the order of the day as more than 500 competitors took part in last weekend's 17th Annual Grand River Bass Derby. Jay Martindale grabbed top laurels in the live release category with a 19 9/16-inch bass and is now the proud owner of the 14-foot Legend boat, a 9.9 HP Mercury outboard and trailer prize package. The Waterloo native narrowly beat out Kitchener's Dave Banwall who placed second with a 19.5-inch entry. Gary Boettger of Waterloo placed third with a 19 9/32-inch bass. In the youth category, Nolan Grimm of Kitchener took first place and a mountain bike with his 19 3/16-inch bass. Ron Kingsley of Waterloo placed second with an 18 1/8-inch bass and Kitchener's Andre Boucher took third place with a 16.25-inch entry.                 Another invading species, the zebra mussel, appears to be at the helm of this major shift, creating habitat that's right for the invading panfish but wrong for walleye. The fingernail-sized mussels, native to the Caspian Sea region of Asia, were transported to the Great Lakes via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel in 1988. Since that time, they have spread rapidly to all of the Great Lakes and waterways in many states, as well as in Ontario and Quebec.

T1  - And on to the future...: [Final Edition]
AN  - 348244248
AB  - The waters of the Great Lakes are a chemical concoction swirling with pharmaceuticals and airborne toxins. Decaying algae blooms stink up beaches. Boy fish become girl fish. There's an expanding dead zone in Lake Erie. Invasive species such as zebra mussels swallow territory and push out native fish, changing the culture of lake populations all the way up the food chain to the birds who feast on poisoned fish. Water levels are dropping because of global warming.

              
   "Estimates of the annual economic damage caused nationwide by invasive species go as high as $137 billion," Senator Carl Levin of Michigan said in a statement before Congress in March. "(The bill) is a lot of money, but it is a critical investment. As those of us from the Great Lakes know, the economic damage that invasive species can cause is much greater."

              
   A binational citizens' group, Great Lakes United, has outlined a plan of action for a multitude of problems which it handed out to Great Lakes mayors attending a conference in St. Catharines this week.

T1  - The framing of farmed fish: product, efficiency, and technology
AN  - 220549636
AB  - Environmentalists, too, use the concept of "product" as a point of departure for their framings of the aquaculture industry. One Georgia Strait Alliance publication highlights the metaphorical change that occurs when fish are turned from animals into products. Under the heading "messing with mother nature," fish farming is placed in stark contrast to wild salmon which are "one of Nature's miracles": "no one really understands the homing instinct that brings them from thousands of miles away back to the exact river, stream or creek where they were born" (Fish Farm Fiasco Factsheet #1). As soon as fish are accepted as being mysterious and sacred, we can no longer easily turn them into the carefully crafted, boxed, and marketed products that farmed salmon become in the frames employed by the industry. In fact, salmon farming is rejected on the grounds that it invades and circumvents nature's own processes for growing fish: "like factory-raised chickens, farmed salmon are fooled into fattening faster. Some farms use bright lights to confuse them into thinking all day -- and night -- is feeding time" (Georgia Strait Alliance, Fish Farm Fiasco Factsheet #3). Farmed salmon are compared to farmed chicken that spend their "short, miserable lives" in "cruel conditions"; "that's why many consumers spend a little extra money to buy free-range eggs" (Georgia Strait Alliance, Fish Farm Fiasco Factsheet #3). In place of salmon as a product, the environmentalists here create and attempt to have us respond to nature as a living, organic whole. It is this organic solidarity which is presented as an alternative to the more mechanistic solidarity of the aquaculture industry's product frame.              People, like animals, can be framed as imagineered products. For a period of time in the late 1990s, the BC Salmon Farmers Association ran a newspaper advertisement which featured a photograph of a man, with the headline: "Salmon farming is a sustainable, high-tech industry that allows me to live and work in a coastal community" (Vancouver Sun, August 24, 1996, A7). The caption indicates that the man is in fact "Jamie Bridge, Biologist, Salmon Farm Technician, Nanaimo, BC." Most likely, this is a real individual, with a real job, in the real community of Nanaimo. Although this person is pictured, the photograph hides the fact that it has become almost impossible to isolate one instance of the salmon farmer. Jamie Bridge is a fish farm technician, yet his work seems to be superseded by the industry's growth potential, of which he is cited as a mere example. The advertisement describes finfish farm workers' careers as built up around, and defined by, the "increasingly competitive world market:" "today we employ skilled workers and advanced aquaculture technology to produce a premium food product." It therefore becomes difficult to determine, in typical post-modern style, whether a human-being is at the center of what it means to be a salmon farm worker, or whether it is instead "productivity," "competitiveness" and "expansion" that are the models of which actual people are the instances: "Sustaining the health and productivity of our farms is one of the reasons BC salmon farmers need more farm sites.... I'm proud to be a salmon farmer." A whole world of simulated meaning closes in on the meaning of farmed salmon. Subject and periphery are no longer distinguishable; whenever they try to locate one example of a fish farmer, the salmon farming proponents are already on the other side in their talk about the nameless and faceless forces of efficiency and control. The common-sensical concepts surrounding fish as products become dissolved in a set of simulated people and activities that are themselves turned into products. In this way, as will be explained later, common-sensical and hyper-real framings can build upon and depend upon one another.

T1  - Short-circuited Why the Pickering A power station is over budget and behind schedule ; Bad management, costly environmental assessment plague plant's restart And don't forget the coagula mussel, by John Spears and Richard Brennan: [Ontario Edition]
AN  - 438543616
AB  - CANEC president Bruce Hinkley said in a statement delivered to the Star he could not comment on the situation at Pickering A because the company is under contract to OPG "and remains committed to honouring the contract, which precludes CANEC from discussing details of the project at this time."                 What complicated matters even more was that, initially, CANEC was not merely a contractor. Instead, it had entered into an "alliance" with OPG and several other major firms working on Pickering A in which the partners agreed to share the profits if they could come in under budget- or share the losses if they didn't.                 In fact, OPG says the design work wasn't completed until spring 2002. And instead of being funnelled to OPG in a steady stream, the work was dumped, all at once, on OPG's doorstep, leaving OPG with mounds of engineering documents to piece through. At OPG, the delivery is still referred to as "the waterfall."

T1  - Though small, the lowly leech could pose big risk: [Ontario Edition]
AN  - 438491446
AB  - Worldwide, leeches come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but the species of concern are pond leeches that resemble shortened, flattened, colourful earthworms who swim underwater with a graceful, undulating movement and are legally imported for use as bait by anglers.                 These leeches consume blood, which means they come into contact with the bloodstream of host animals (including humans). Considering that Lyme disease is spread by blood-eating ticks, rabies by infected body fluids entering bloodstreams and West Nile virus by blood-hungry mosquitoes, the threat of some new disease organism entering our waterways via the introduction of foreign leeches should be obvious.                 The import of leeches has already been restricted to licensed bait dealers, but that has not stopped the increasing popularity of leeches among anglers. So I am delighted to report that Ontario's Ministry of Natural Resources has now posted on the Environmental Bill of Rights registry a proposal to ban import of leeches by the start of 2004.

T1  - Looking at life from inside the workings of a great ship: [Final Edition]
AN  - 270117325
AB  - There it empties its holds and takes on a new load headed overseas. Out goes the Hamilton ballast, along with the unwelcome life forms that were in the supposedly empty ballast tanks.                 Among the scientists studying the ballast water problem are David Reid at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Mich., and Hugh McIsaac at the University of Windsor. The group tested ships last year -- usually ones that made their first stop in Hamilton -- and routinely found live organisms, resting eggs or the spores of aquatic plants.                 The resting eggs hatched readily in lab conditions, so this year they'll look for any evidence of hatching on board, work that's done with the help of companies such as Montreal-based Fednav, which says it let scientists test empty ballast tanks on a ship last season.

T1  - Potentially deadly toxin could hit Lake Ontario by autumn: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349464732
AB  - For the third consecutive year, fish and bird carcasses have littered beaches along Lake Erie on both sides of the border, leading researchers to believe a potentially deadly toxin, created by type E botulism, is to blame.

              
   Jeff Robinson, a biologist with Environment Canada, says this epidemic appears to be travelling east and is poised to hit Lake Ontario by autumn -- a serious threat to any wildlife that travels south for the winter via Lake Ontario.

              
   The theory scientists are probing is that the goby, a fish that dwells at the bottom of the lakes, is eating the zebra mussel and dying from the toxin. The toxin is suspected of effectively climbing the food chain to other fish, fish-eating birds, ducks and even a small number of eagles.

T1  - Alien species threatens lakes: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349411252
AB  - "Scientific consensus indicates that the introduction of the Asian carp may result in economic and ecological damages to the Great Lakes ecosystem that far exceed those brought by the previous introduction of the sea lamprey and the zebra mussel," the IJC says in an open letter to Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham and U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell.

              
   To prevent the alien species from getting into the Great Lakes, an electric barrier has been set up in an Illinois canal linking the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan. "It was designed to keep the round-eyed goby from spreading out of the Great Lakes," said [Jim Houston].

              
   Houston said at least three Asian carp have been found in the Great Lakes -- two on the U.S. side of Lake Erie and one on the Canadian side.

T1  - The newest eco-hazard: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359348821
AB  - OTTAWA - Can a Frankenfish outlast the killer bees and zebra mussels? What with the Martin-Chretien feud, the much-hyped G8 summit and the perishing heat, only the most vigilant readers will have heard about this summer's terrifying eco-hazard. (That is why I am here.)                 True to the time-honoured eco-hazard template, the Frankenfish is described as a "ferocious predator." It is, as so many recent eco- hazards seem to be, an import from China (which suggests an unresolved xenophobia in this country and a promising topic for a post-grad cultural studies thesis). However, unlike most invaders, the snakehead did not first arrive on this continent in the hold of a cargo ship. It is an aquarium species and a delicacy in some Asian cuisines.                 Some sources suggest the sample found in that Maryland pond may have escaped from a bankrupt pet store in a nearby strip mall (which isn't to suggest that strip malls can be construed as a natural habitat). It goes without saying that the northern snakehead has no known predators. Or that it poses a dreadful threat to vulnerable native species. Or that it reproduces with indecent haste and frequency. There is one seldom-mentioned trait all these avaricious newcomers share, however: They only seem to spread in summer and in the absence of more compelling news. By fall, when the regular news cycle reasserts itself, the mutant invaders drop out of sight entirely, only to reappear in subsequent summers in far less virulent form.

T1  - Spiny water flea may frustrate fishers: [Final Edition]
AN  - 361264413
AB  - The spiny water flea with its barbed tail is just the latest of about 160 species introduced to the Great Lakes basin over the past 500 years. Most scientists agree the effects of the flea - which, as a crustacean, is the shrimp's tiny cousin - won't be as far- reaching as that of the zebra mussel, which has been clogging up water intake pipes in central Canada since the 1980s.

AB  - Large vessels on transoceanic voyages may carry the equivalent of a small lake-more than 100,000 tons of ballast water-for thousands of miles, but they also carry a host of organisms that enter the tanks along with the water. After these organisms are flushed into the novel environment of a port or waterway, some of them may begin to crowd out native species and disrupt local ecosystems.

T1  - Environmental Toxicology
AN  - 2134997684
AB  - The fundamental principles of environmental toxicology are clearly presented here for university students and professionals in related fields. This book consists of two parts. In the first part basic metabolic, physiological, and pharmacological concepts are used to explain the fate of toxic chemicals in the body, with emphasis on carcinogenesis and mutagenesis. This part also contains a chapter on chemicals disrupting the endocrine system and a chapter on risk assessment and the precautionary principle. The second section deals with specific environmental problems - air pollution, alteration of the earth's atmosphere, water and land pollution, including sections on wetlands, organic agriculture and genetically modified crops. It also deals with health and environmental effects of ionized radiation, and the effect of a rapid population growth on the environmental and human welfare. Chapter on pollution control and regulatory policies are also included.

T1  - Molluscs as Crop Pests
AN  - 2131938415
AB  - Mollusc species currently constitute a major threat to sustainable agriculture, associated with cultivation of new crops, intensification of agricultural production systems, and the spread through human trade and travel of species adapted to these modified environments. In some crops, their significance is only now becoming apparent with the decline in the importance of other pest groups which can be effectively controlled. This book includes examinations of the deployment of molluscicides in baits, specific crop situations from around the world and synopses of the current pest status of mollusc cpecies or species groups and the progress towards the development of solutions.

T1  - Treasured islands: straddling the equator, the Galapagos Islands teem with the unexpected. So writes invertebrate zoologist Dale Calder, after a week of collecting plant-like marine animals in this ecologically rich and fragile archipelago: Magazine of the Royal Ontario Museum
AN  - 199514041
AB  - On our own trip, my work was to investigate the biodiversity and ecology of hydroids--which belong to a major group or "phylum" of invertebrate animals known as Cnidaria--in waters around this rugged and volcanic chain of islands. Cnidaria also includes corals, sea fans, sea anemones, jelly-fishes, and their relatives. An important part of the sea's food web, 3200 species of hydroid are found worldwide. Fire corals, familiar to divers for their painful sting, are really hydroids, not true corals. The "airferns" often sold in florist shops are actually a species of air-dried and green-dyed hydroid. Plant-like in appearance, hydroids usually attach themselves to and grow on submerged objects. Like zebra mussels, barnacles, and algae, they can become pests, fouling the bottoms of ships and the cooling-water intakes of industrial plants. A few, like the fire corals, are venomous to humans. Others may hold potential in biomedical research. The ROM is one of the few places in the world where studies are carried out on these obscure "lower invertebrates," and our collections are among the best anywhere. I knew that compiling an inventory of hydroids in the Galapagos would be useful for other biologists in assessing the overall biodiversity of the islands, baseline data so necessary to understanding how the region's ecosystems operate and how best to protect them.

              
Biologists know that the terrestrial life of the Galapagos, studied extensively over the past couple of centuries, is enigmatic. But the marine environment and sea life of the islands, much less investigated, is downright paradoxical. Though the archipelago straddles the equator, where you might expect to find balmy waters, extensive reefs, and an explosion of biodiversity, neither the surrounding waters nor the resident sea life are typical of the tropics. The coral reefs are localized and little developed. The diversity of marine fauna and flora is comparatively low, and many species that are widespread in the tropical Pacific are absent altogether. And yet, at the same time, marine productivity and fertility is higher than might be expected in an equatorial region.

              
Back in my lab at the ROM, the process of sorting and identifying the newly collected hydroids and adding them to the database is still in progress. Already, my ROM colleagues and I have documented about 100 species of hydroids from the Galapagos area--some of the specimens are new to science. Predictably, the overall group seems most closely related to the fauna of the adjacent coast of South and Central America. Most of the species we found in the Galapagos were likely introduced from there long ago, rafting over on flotsam. The wide stretch of ocean is less of a barrier to colonization for marine life than for terrestrial plants and animals. That's why there are fewer marine species than terrestrial ones that are endemic to the Galapagos. As we expected from the relatively cool waters of the islands, certain hydroids that flourish in tropical areas of the Pacific are absent here--fire corals are a prime example. Instead, dozens of typically warm to temperate species were among those collected. With scientific names as exotic as the islands they inhabit--Turritopsis nutricula, Cladocoryne floccosa--each comprises an important part of the web of life around the Galapagos.

AB  - We measured substantial differences in Cd accumulation among four species of the phantom midge Chaoborus that were exposed in the laboratory to the same Cd concentration in naturally contaminated prey. The two large-bodied species accumulated more Cd than did the two small-bodied species, in spite of the fact that all species ingested prey at the same rate.

T1  - Vanishing, shrimp-like crustaceans cause for alarm: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359145676
AB  - One theory is that zebra mussels, thumbnail-sized mollusks that arrived in the ballast water of oceangoing ships, are competing with diporeia for the same food -- and winning, said Marc Tuchman, an environmental scientist in the Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes National Program Office in Chicago. Both dine on bacteria and algae, but the mussels multiply rapidly and can filter vast amounts of water.                 There also is speculation that there is enough food but mussels are extracting from it a nutrient essential to diporeia, that mussels introduced a pathogen lethal to diporeia, or that a mucouslike substance excreted by mussels is killing diporeia, said Thomas Nalepa, a research biologist at the Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab in Ann Arbor. The lab is part of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.                 Researchers have found no diporeia in Lake Erie since the early 1990s -- Tuchman said fisheries experts have reported a dramatic decline in rainbow smelt and young white fish there. Also, diporeia levels have collapsed in Lake Ontario and are disappearing from shallow waters of southern Lake Michigan.

T1  - Great Lakes `invaders' killing native species: Researchers discuss ways to stop proliferation of foreign plants, animals: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349178444
AB  - "The more (non-native species) that we bring together, the more they react in ways that are unpredictable and that enhance their impacts," said Anthony Ricciardi, a scientist at Dalhousie University in Halifax. He made the comment to Booth Newspapers for a story Monday.

              
   Exotic species invasions occurred as long ago as the 1830s when the sea lamprey entered Lake Ontario through a barge canal, and as recently as 1998 with the discovery of the fishhook water flea, also in Lake Ontario.

              
   The acceleration of invasions could be because the St. Lawrence Seaway opened the entire Great Lakes to foreign ship traffic in 1959, Ricciardi said.

AN  - 2131331241
AB  - The first edition of this book, published by University Press of New England in 1986, sold over 2500 copies, and was received as the best introductory overview of this broad field. Quite a lot has happened in the field of symbiosis in the past 10 years, especially concerning molecular mechanisms. Ahmadjian and Paracer have thoroughly updated their book, addressing advances in the field and the emergence of fields such as cellular microbiology, immunoparasitology, and endocytobiology, which have revealed new aspects of symbiosis. It is the only book to cover all aspects of symbiosis at an introductory level.

T1  - Incorporating Science, Economics, and Sociology in Developing Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards in International Trade:&nbsp;Proceedings of a Conference
AN  - 2132046886
AB  - The rapid expansion of international trade has brought to the fore issues of conflicting national regulations in the area of plant, animal, and human health. These problems include the concern that regulations designed to protect health can also be used for protection of domestic producers against international competition. At a time when progressive tariff reform has opened up markets and facilitated trade, in part responding to consumer demands for access to a wide choice of products and services at reasonable prices, closer scrutiny of regulatory measures has become increasingly important. At the same time, there are clear differences among countries and cultures as to the types of risk citizens are willing to accept. The activities of this conference were based on the premise that risk analyses (i.e., risk assessment, management, and communication) are not exclusively the domain of the biological and natural sciences; the social sciences play a prominent role in describing how people in different contexts perceive and respond to risks. Any effort to manage sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) issues in international trade must integrate all the sciences to develop practices for risk assessment, management, and communication that recognize international diversity in culture, experience, and institutions. Uniform international standards can help, but no such norms are likely to be acceptable to all countries. Political and administrative structures also differ, causing differences in approaches and outcomes even when basic aims are compatible. Clearly there is considerable room for confusion and mistrust. The issue is how to balance the individual regulatory needs and approaches of countries with the goal of promoting freer trade. This issue arises not only for SPS standards but also in regard to regulations that affect other areas such as environmental quality, working conditions, and the exercise of intellectual property rights. This conference focused on these issues in the specific area of SPS measures. This area includes provisions to protect plant and animal health and life and, more generally, the environment, and regulations that protect humans from foodborne risks. The Society for Risk Analysis defines a risk as the potential for realization of unwanted, adverse consequences to human life, health, property, or the environment; estimation of risk is usually based on the expected value of the conditional probability of the event occurring times the consequence of the event given that it has occurred. The task of this conference and of this report was to elucidate the place of science, culture, politics, and economics in the design and implementation of SPS measures and in their international management. The goal was to explore the critical roles and the limitations of the biological and natural sciences and the social sciences, such as economics, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, and political science in the management of SPS issues and in judging whether particular SPS measures create unacceptable barriers to international trade. The conference's objective also was to consider the elements that would compose a multidisciplinary analytical framework for SPS decision making and needs for future research.

T1  - Watershed Management for Potable Water Supply:&nbsp;Assessing the New York City Strategy
AN  - 2131401045
AB  - In 1997, New York City adopted a mammoth watershed agreement to protect its drinking water and avoid filtration of its large upstate surface water supply. Shortly thereafter, the NRC began an analysis of the agreement's scientific validity. 
The resulting book finds New York City's watershed agreement to be a good template for proactive watershed management that, if properly implemented, will maintain high water quality. However, it cautions that the agreement is not a guarantee of permanent filtration avoidance because of changing regulations, uncertainties regarding pollution sources, advances in treatment technologies, and natural variations in watershed conditions. 
The book recommends that New York City place its highest priority on pathogenic microorganisms in the watershed and direct its resources toward improving methods for detecting pathogens, understanding pathogen transport and fate, and demonstrating that best management practices will remove pathogens. Other recommendations, which are broadly applicable to surface water supplies across the country, target buffer zones, stormwater management, water quality monitoring, and effluent trading.

T1  - Invertebrates as Webmasters in Ecosystems
AN  - 2131909926
AB  - Invertebrates are conspicuous, influential components in all of the ecosystems of the world. Assemblages of invertebrates assume an organizing function and hence may be considered as ''webmasters'' in these ecosystems. This book reviews and assesses our current understanding of invertebrates in terrestrial and terrestrially-dominated (lower-order stream) ecosystems. It emphasizes the centrality of the activity of invertebrates, which influence ecosystems function far out of proportion to their physical mass in a wide range of situations, particularly at the soil interface between land and air (litter/soil), water and land (sediments) and in tree canopies and root/soil systems.

T1  - A biologically-poor McEarth would be an unhealthy, lonely place to live: [Final Edition]
AN  - 345732076
AB  - The spread of introduced or invasive species has been one of many damaging environmental side-effects of the push towards a globalized economy. As worldwide trade has increased, species have been given free rides to virtually every corner of the planet, and that's meant big trouble to indigenous creatures, some of which have been pushed to the brink of extinction by invaders. Invasive species reach foreign ecosystems in a variety of ways. The ballast water of freighters, for example, is a virtual aquarium of exotic species and is routinely dumped in the harbours of port cities. Grain, lumber, fruit and millions of other goods are shipped around the world every day. These can carry insects, small mammals, plant spores or other organisms that are then released into new areas.

              
   Every species on this planet has a role to play in the functioning of the biosphere as a whole. When introduced species run rampant and displace indigenous species, the result is a loss of biodiversity. In turn, this reduces the capacity of the Earth to fulfil the biological cycles that maintain all life. Ecologists are concerned that the spread of invasives could result in a few successful species dominating the planet, resulting in what some have dubbed a global McEcosystem.

T1  - PROBLEMS PLAGUE LAKE ERIE PCBS AND PHOSPHOROUS STILL THREATEN LAKE: REPORT: [FINAL EDITION]
AN  - 269964871
AB  - An Environmental Protection Agency official said yesterday that the U.S. government wants to steer more money into ridding Lake Erie of dangerous PCBs.                 U.S. Representative Steve LaTourette of Ohio, co-chair of the House of Representatives' Great Lakes Task Force, said zebra mussels continue to be a source of economic and environmental trouble that could force the lake's phosphorous level to take a nosedive and alter the food chain.                 The inventory of problems was part of a multiyear process leading up to a plan instructing U.S. states, and the federal governments of the United States and Canada, on what they should be doing for each of the Great Lakes.

T1  - Out-of-touch angler really misses the boat: [1 Edition]
AN  - 437799220
AB  - The only guy blessed by last week's wild and windy weather was Bill Beacham of Dundas, whose 40.05-pound salmon was the biggest to hit the scales this year, and earned him the weekly first prize in the Great Salmon Hunt. The lumpy lake kept most of the competition ashore where they couldn't upset his apple cart.                 Jim Fogarty of Canadian Trophy Fishing Charters (416) 229-0367 based at Bluffers Park says: "This is the best season in 20 years of plying my profession on Lake Ontario." Depending with whom you're speaking, Fogarty is either grandfather or godfather of the charter fishing fleet.                 We know that fish eat them, and that they may account for the abundant and healthy alewife population in Lake Ontario. Unfortunately, they haven't stopped there and we're told they now occur in the Kawarthas, Muskoka Lakes, Simcoe, Temagami and many others. Like zebra mussels, it seems there's no stopping them.

T1  - Ontario's lakes offer good catch after long decline: [Final Edition]
AN  - 275536111
AB  - Walleye fishing in western Lake Erie and eastern Lake Ontario is said to be superb. The muskie -- thanks to a catch-and-release program -- are huge on Lake St. Clair and the Niagara River.                 In the 1970s, the headlines screamed Lake Erie was dead after Cleveland's polluted Cuyahoga River actually burned and phosphorous- fed algae were choking the lake. A huge mercury spill in Lake St. Clair by Dow Chemical, also in the 1970s, helped spark environmental controls.                 Zebra mussels have infiltrated the Great Lakes, and changed its ecosystem by eating plankton and other microscopic food, leading to clearer water. Lake Ontario salmon rely on murkier water and foraging fish whose food is stolen by the mussels, which have no natural predators.

T1  - Resources for Teaching Middle School Science
AN  - 2301958364
AB  - With age-appropriate, inquiry-centered curriculum materials and sound teaching practices, middle school science can capture the interest and energy of adolescent students and expand their understanding of the world around them. 

Resources for Teaching Middle School Science, developed by the National Science Resources Center (NSRC), is a valuable tool for identifying and selecting effective science curriculum materials that will engage students in grades 6 through 8. The volume describes more than 400 curriculum titles that are aligned with the National Science Education Standards. 
This completely new guide follows on the success of 
Resources for Teaching Elementary School Science, the first in the NSRC series of annotated guides to hands-on, inquiry-centered curriculum materials and other resources for science teachers. 
The curriculum materials in the new guide are grouped in five chapters by scientific area?Physical Science, Life Science, Environmental Science, Earth and Space Science, and Multidisciplinary and Applied Science. They are also grouped by type?core materials, supplementary units, and science activity books. 
Each annotation of curriculum material includes a recommended grade level, a description of the activities involved and of what students can be expected to learn, a list of accompanying materials, a reading level, and ordering information. 
The curriculum materials included in this book were selected by panels of teachers and scientists using evaluation criteria developed for the guide. The criteria reflect and incorporate goals and principles of the National Science Education Standards. The annotations designate the specific content standards on which these curriculum pieces focus. 
In addition to the curriculum chapters, the guide contains six chapters of diverse resources that are directly relevant to middle school science. Among these is a chapter on educational software and multimedia programs, chapters on books about science and teaching, directories and guides to science trade books, and periodicals for teachers and students. 
Another section features institutional resources. One chapter lists about 600 science centers, museums, and zoos where teachers can take middle school students for interactive science experiences. Another chapter describes nearly 140 professional associations and U.S. government agencies that offer resources and assistance. 
Authoritative, extensive, and thoroughly indexed?and the only guide of its kind?
Resources for Teaching Middle School Science will be the most used book on the shelf for science teachers, school administrators, teacher trainers, science curriculum specialists, advocates of hands-on science teaching, and concerned parents.

T1  - Jane Jacobs: prophet of globalization? Yes, but with a (local) human face
AN  - 204574618
AB  - During a recent conference in Toronto which celebrated the ideas of [Jane Jacobs], a headline in the Globe and Mail proclaimed: 'Jacobs embraced as economic guru: The woman known for her thoughts on urban planning is now a key figure in new growth theory and a prophet of globalization.'(f.1) Prophet of globalization? Not the Jane Jacobs I know.              To the extent that the globalizers who lean on Jacobs are half right, it is mainly through an error of omission. They omit the critical essence of the urban organism that Jacobs' vision reveals, its immune system: local democracy. Like all organisms, a city stays vital when engaged citizens act as the white blood cells. Jacobs believes that a vigorous urban organism, with its life force of private enterprise, trade, competition, and innovation, requires a healthy and unrestrained civil society. She is adamant in opposing government and corporate policies which weaken citizen politics.              Jacobs' organic analysis appears somewhat inadequate in explaining the actions of those transnationals which are achieving immunity from local law and whose activities are beyond the reach of local civic action. This is particularly evident in Systems of Survival when the question of child labour and other exploitative practices are raised. One of Jacobs' personae, the interdisciplinary biologist, says that these 'are obsolete in commercially advanced societies.'(f.10) This is not true, as any educated consumer of oriental carpets or embroidered haute couture garments made in Asia knows. Small fingers for the fine work, they say. The suffering has been displaced offshore, and the levels and variety of abuse are on the increase. Jacobs' optimistic view of honest trade suffers from an apparent lack of interest in the invisible exploitation of people and resources in far-off places, both in her silent indifference to unjust international linkages and in her mainly benign view of global commerce.

AB  - "The interest level is there, the minds are there," Windsor biologist Jan Ciborowski told the Council of Great Lakes Research Managers, an arm of the International Joint Commission.

              
   An invasion of foreign species, including billons of zebra mussels, and rapid changes in pollution levels have changed the lake, but Ciborowski said no one knows what will happen to the fish that live there.

AB  - Near Vevey, on the shores of the Geneva Lake, a new marina has just been achieved for 376 boats, on the site of the old floating marina destroyed during a tremendous aeolian storm. The aim of this article is to describe how the works were carried out and which were the special techniques used within difficult geotechnical conditions. It also deals with the protection of the terrestrial and aquatic environment and its building consequences, as actually the swiss legislation for nature protection has become very strict for any new construction. INTRODUCTION On Saturday April 4, 1987, near NESTLE International Headquarters, there was a strong East wind called La Vaudaire. Suddenly, the main floating breakwater of the Piche

T1  - Ecology and Management of Breeding Waterfowl
AN  - 2130842575
AB  - In August of 1987, the International Symposium on the Ecology and Management of Breeding Waterfowl was held in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It was organized by the staff of the Delta Waterfowl and Wetlands Research Station in recognition of the fiftieth year of research that would be conducted through that institution in 1988. A major goal was to review the progress that had been made in this field during the previous five decades of research in various subject areas within the broader scope of breeding waterfowl ecology. This volume represents the final versions of the nineteen plenary papers that have been revised and updated since the symposium.

T1  - "Dangerous' game farms breed disease, critics warn: [Final Edition]
AN  - 275368296
AB  - Plenty, according to critics. They point to a number of disturbing events that have occurred in the industry: In the past 14 months, seven Ontario game farms have been stricken by outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis, forcing the destruction of an estimated 1,300 animals.                 Imported red deer, a larger, stronger relative of the white-tail deer were slaughtered in Owen Sound after they became infected with a deadly parasite. The parasite, known as "muscle worm," has the potential to devastate native populations of deer and moose, biologists say.                 The effects of introducing new species can be devastating as the unhindered spread of zebra mussels from the Great Lakes into cottage country shows. The mussels, originally from Europe, were introduced by ocean-going freighters that dumped their seawater ballast inland.

T1  - Restoration of Aquatic Ecosystems:&nbsp;Science, Technology, and Public Policy
AN  - 2130970976
AB  - Aldo Leopold, father of the "land ethic," once said, "The time has come for science to busy itself with the earth itself. The first step is to reconstruct a sample of what we had to begin with." The concept he expressed--restoration--is defined in this comprehensive new volume that examines the prospects for repairing the damage society has done to the nation's aquatic resources: lakes, rivers and streams, and wetlands.
 Restoration of Aquatic Ecosystems outlines a national strategy for aquatic restoration, with practical recommendations, and features case studies of aquatic restoration activities around the country.
 The committee examines
 Key concepts and techniques used in restoration.
 Common factors in successful restoration efforts.
 Threats to the health of the nation's aquatic ecosystems.
 Approaches to evaluation before, during, and after a restoration project.
 The emerging specialties of restoration and landscape ecology.

T1  - Ottawa runs up $527 million travel bill: [FIN Edition]
AN  - 436252196
AB  - CHURCHILL, Man. (CP) - Despite some close calls as boats operated by protesters and whalers criss-crossed on the Churchill River, three beluga whales were captured yesterday for a Vancouver aquarium. After the capture, Lifeforce protesters complained to the RCMP about the alleged "dangerous operation" of whalers' boats and damage to their own craft. Whalers filed their own complaint of harassment by Lifeforce.                 ST. CATHARINES (CP) - A local company will help fire high- frequency sound waves at zebra mussels in an attempt to control their rapid spread. Aquatic Sciences Inc. and Sonalysts Inc. of Waterford, Conn., have permission from Niagara Region's public works committee to use sound to protect the local water treatment plant from a mussel invasion. Experts warn unimpeded growth of the mussels could cause $5 billion worth of damage over 10 years.
