T1  - Functional Diversification of Oyster Big Defensins Generates Antimicrobial Specificity and Synergy against Members of the Microbiota
AN  - 2756739806
AB  - Big defensins are two-domain antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that have highly diversified in mollusks. Cg-BigDefs are expressed by immune cells in the oyster Crassostrea gigas, and their expression is dampened during the Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS), which evolves toward fatal bacteremia. We evaluated whether Cg-BigDefs contribute to the control of oyster-associated microbial communities. Two Cg-BigDefs that are representative of molecular diversity within the peptide family, namely Cg-BigDef1 and Cg-BigDef5, were characterized by gene cloning and synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis and native chemical ligation. Synthetic peptides were tested for antibacterial activity against a collection of culturable bacteria belonging to the oyster microbiota, characterized by 16S sequencing and MALDI Biotyping. We first tested the potential of Cg-BigDefs to control the oyster microbiota by injecting synthetic Cg-BigDef1 into oyster tissues and analyzing microbiota dynamics over 24 h by 16S metabarcoding. Cg-BigDef1 induced a significant shift in oyster microbiota β-diversity after 6 h and 24 h, prompting us to investigate antimicrobial activities in vitro against members of the oyster microbiota. Both Cg-BigDef1 and Cg-BigDef5 were active at a high salt concentration (400 mM NaCl) and showed broad spectra of activity against bacteria associated with C. gigas pathologies. Antimicrobial specificity was observed for both molecules at an intra- and inter-genera level. Remarkably, antimicrobial spectra of Cg-BigDef1 and Cg-BigDef5 were complementary, and peptides acted synergistically. Overall, we found that primary sequence diversification of Cg-BigDefs has generated specificity and synergy and extended the spectrum of activity of this peptide family.

T1  - Antioxidant and Antimicrobial Peptides Derived from Food Proteins
AN  - 2633230139
AB  - Recently, the demand for food proteins in the market has increased due to a rise in degenerative illnesses that are associated with the excessive production of free radicals and the unwanted side effects of various drugs, for which researchers have suggested diets rich in bioactive compounds. Some of the functional compounds present in foods are antioxidant and antimicrobial peptides, which are used to produce foods that promote health and to reduce the consumption of antibiotics. These peptides have been obtained from various sources of proteins, such as foods and agri-food by-products, via enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial fermentation. Peptides with antioxidant properties exert effective metal ion (Fe2+/Cu2+) chelating activity and lipid peroxidation inhibition, which may lead to notably beneficial effects in promoting human health and food processing. Antimicrobial peptides are small oligo-peptides generally containing from 10 to 100 amino acids, with a net positive charge and an amphipathic structure; they are the most important components of the antibacterial defense of organisms at almost all levels of life—bacteria, fungi, plants, amphibians, insects, birds and mammals—and have been suggested as natural compounds that neutralize the toxicity of reactive oxygen species generated by antibiotics and the stress generated by various exogenous sources. This review discusses what antioxidant and antimicrobial peptides are, their source, production, some bioinformatics tools used for their obtainment, emerging technologies, and health benefits.

T1  - Relationship between bacterial phylotype and specialized metabolite production in the culturable microbiome of two freshwater sponges
AN  - 2564703137
AB  - Microbial drug discovery programs rely heavily on accessing bacterial diversity from the environment to acquire new specialized metabolite (SM) lead compounds for the therapeutic pipeline. Therefore, knowledge of how certain bacterial taxa are distributed in nature, in addition to the degree of variation of SM production within those taxa, is critical to informing these front-end discovery efforts and making the overall sample collection and bacterial library creation process more efficient. In the current study we employed MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and the bioinformatics pipeline IDBac to analyze diversity within phylotype groupings and SM profiles of hundreds of bacterial isolates from two Eunapius fragilis freshwater sponges, collected 1.5 km apart. We demonstrated that within two sponge samples of the same species, the culturable bacterial populations contained significant overlap in approximate genus-level phylotypes but mostly non-overlapping populations of isolates when grouped lower than the level of genus. Further, correlations between bacterial phylotype and SM production varied at the species level and below, suggesting SM distribution within bacterial taxa must be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. Our results suggest that two E. fragilis freshwater sponges collected in similar environments can exhibit large culturable diversity on a species-level scale, thus researchers should scrutinize the isolates with analyses that take both phylogeny and SM production into account in order to optimize the chemical space entering into a downstream bacterial library.

T1  - Do Single-Component and Mixtures Selected Organic UV Filters Induce Embryotoxic Effects in Zebrafish (Danio rerio)?
AN  - 2565720031
AB  - UVs are important ingredients in common cosmetic products (e.g., sunscreens, hairsprays, soap). After their use, they can enter the aquatic ecosystem and negatively affect non-target aquatic organisms. The aim of our study was to evaluate acute embryotoxicity of selected organic UVs 2-phenylbenzimidazole-5-sulfonic acid (PBSA), ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate (EHMC), octocrylene (OC), 4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3). The chemicals were tested both as a single substance and their mixtures. The types of mixtures were chosen as follows: the combination of OC and 4-MBC; the combination of PBSA, EHMC and BP-3 and the combination of all five UV filters. The embryotoxicity was evaluated using a modified method of the Fish Embryo Acute Toxicity Test-OECD guideline 236 and zebrafish (Danio rerio) was selected as a suitable fish model organism. The toxic effects were studied by assessing mortality, hatching and the occurrence of malformations at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post fertilization. The obtained results indicate that especially the mixture of OC and 4-MBC presents a potential risk of embryotoxicity for zebrafish due to a significant increase in mortality, which was 41.7% in the experimental group exposed to 10 μg/L at 96 h post fertilization. Based on our results, the most effected sub-lethal endpoints were hatching and malformation (e.g., edema of pericard, bent spine, yolk edema), but with no statistically significant effect. These results differ within groups with single UVs and with their mixtures, suggesting the interaction of these substances when they are exposed together.

T1  - A Predictive Model of Chlorophyll a in Western Lake Erie Based on Artificial Neural Network
AN  - 2554413107
AB  - The reoccurrence of algal blooms in western Lake Erie (WLE) since the mid-1990s, under increased system stress from climate change and excessive nutrients, has shown the need for developing management tools to predict water quality. In this study, process-based model GLM-AED (General Lake Model-Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics) and statistical model ANN (artificial neural network) were developed with meteorological forcing derived from surface buoys, airports, and land-based stations and historical monitoring nutrients, to predict water quality in WLE from 2002 to 2015. GLM-AED was calibrated with observed water temperature and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) from 2002 to 2015. For ANN, during the training period (2002–2010), the inputs included meteorological forcing and nutrient concentrations, and the target was Chl-a simulated by calibrated GLM-AED due to the lack of continuously daily measured Chl-a concentrations. During the testing period (2011–2015), the predicted Chl-a concentrations were compared with the observations. The results showed that the ANN model has higher accuracy with lower Chl-a RMSE and MAE values than GLM-AED during 2011 and 2015. Lastly, we applied the established ANN model to predict the future 10-year water quality of WLE, which showed that the probability of adverse health effects would be moderate, so more intense water resources management should be implemented.

T1  - Nutrient-imbalanced conditions shift the interplay between zooplankton and gut microbiota
AN  - 2532599474
AB  - Background
Nutrient stoichiometry of phytoplankton frequently changes with aquatic ambient nutrient concentrations, which is mainly influenced by anthropogenic water treatment and the ecosystem dynamics. Consequently, the stoichiometry of phytoplankton can markedly alter the metabolism and growth of zooplankton. However, the effects of nutrient-imbalanced prey on the interplay between zooplankton and their gut microbiota remain unknown. Using metatranscriptome, a 16s rRNA amplicon-based neutral community model (NCM) and experimental validation, we investigated the interactions between Daphnia magna and its gut microbiota in a nutrient-imbalanced algal diet.
Results
Our results showed that in nutrient-depleted water, the nutrient-enriched zooplankton gut stimulated the accumulation of microbial polyphosphate in fecal pellets under phosphorus limitation and the microbial assimilation of ammonia under nitrogen limitation. Compared with the nutrient replete group, both N and P limitation markedly promoted the gene expression of the gut microbiome for organic matter degradation but repressed that for anaerobic metabolisms. In the nutrient limited diet, the gut microbial community exhibited a higher fit to NCM (R2=0.624 and 0.781, for N- and P-limitation, respectively) when compared with the Control group (R2=0.542), suggesting increased ambient-gut exchange process favored by compensatory feeding. Further, an additional axenic grazing experiment revealed that the growth of D. magna can still benefit from gut microbiota under a nutrient-imbalanced diet.
Conclusions
Together, these results demonstrated that under a nutrient-imbalanced diet, the microbes not only benefit themselves by absorbing excess nutrients inside the zooplankton gut but also help zooplankton to survive during nutrient limitation.

T1  - A genotoxicity study on Talitrus saltator (Crustacea, Amphipoda) exposed to lead and benzo(a)pyrene
AN  - 2469501088
AB  - Sandy beaches are ecosystems often subjected to a variety of pollution sources, including heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, largely due to improper human activities. The sandhopper Talitrus saltator s. l. (Montagu, 1808) typically lives on supralittoral shores where it plays an important ecological role. The purpose of this study was to investigate DNA damage levels on hemocytes of T. saltator by means of the Comet assay. Firstly, we tested the sensitivity and reproducibility of the Comet assay on hemocytes of T. saltator after in vitro exposure (1 h) to the genotoxicant methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). The data demonstrated a DNA damage (defined as % DNA tail) related to MMS exposure in a concentration-dependent manner. Next, we carried out the assay on hemocytes of T. saltator that were exposed in vivo (24 h and 7 days) to (a) lead (Pb), (b) benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), (c) mixtures of them. Our data on exposure to Pb or B(a)P showed DNA damage on the hemocytes of T. saltator in a concentration-dependent manner, but apparently with a non-synergistic effect of exposure to their mixtures. Our results provide a background for further studies in order to verify the applicability of Comet assay on T. saltator for assessing genotoxicity levels in sandy beaches subjected to pollution.

T1  - Shifting patterns of lake color phenology in over 26,000 US lakes
AN  - 2463800473
AB  - Lakes are often defined by seasonal cycles. The seasonal timing, or phenology, of many lake processes, such as primary productivity, are changing in response to human activities. However, long-term records exist for few lakes, and extrapolating patterns observed in these lakes to entire landscapes is exceedingly difficult using the limited number of in situ observations that are available. Limited landscape level observations means we do not know how common shifts in lake phenology are at macroscales. Here, we use a new remote sensing dataset, LimnoSat-US, to analyze U.S. summer lake color phenology between 1984 and 2020 across more than 26,000 lakes. Our results show that summer lake color seasonality can be generalized into five distinct phenology groups that follow well-known patterns of phytoplankton succession. The frequency with which lakes transition from one phenology group to another is tied to lake and landscape level characteristics. Lakes with high discharge and low variation in their seasonal extent are generally more stable while lakes in areas with high interannual variations in climate and catchment population density show less stability. Our research reveals previously unexamined spatiotemporal patterns in lake seasonality and demonstrates the utility of LimnoSat-US, which, with over 22 million remote sensing observations of lakes, creates novel opportunities to systematically examine changing lotic ecosystems at a national scale.

T1  - Climate Change and Microbial Ecology:&nbsp;Current Research and Future Trends
AN  - 2441579886
AB  - The distribution and function of microorganisms are of crucial importance for the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. Effects of microbial communities on the carbon and nitrogen cycles are particularly important for climate gases. These biogeochemical cycles are significantly impacted by global climate change and microbes may respond by accelerating or alleviating human-caused change. Understanding microbial ecology in the different ecosystems is essential for our ability to assess the importance of biogeochemical cycles-climate feedbacks. In the first edition of this acclaimed book, a broad range of renowned scientists reviewed the most important hot-topics in the area of climate change and microbial ecology, thus providing a timely and authoritative overview of this increasingly important area. Climate change is continuing unabated and this new, expanded edition contains revised and updated chapters and the addition of four new chapters covering more of the topical fields in this important area of climate science. This is an essential book for every microbial ecologist from the PhD student to the experienced scientist and is also recommended for everyone interested in the field of global climate change.

T1  - A chromosome-level genome assembly for the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas)
AN  - 2508133893
AB  - Abstract
The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is a marine bivalve species with vital roles in coastal ecosystems and aquaculture globally. While extensive genomic tools are available for C. gigas, highly contiguous reference genomes are required to support both fundamental and applied research. In the current study, high coverage long and short read sequence data generated on Pacific Biosciences and Illumina platforms from a single female individual specimen was used to generate an initial assembly, which was then scaffolded into 10 pseudo chromosomes using both Hi-C sequencing and a high density SNP linkage map. The final assembly has a scaffold N50 of 58.4 Mb and a contig N50 of 1.8 Mb, representing a step advance on the previously published C. gigas assembly. The new assembly was annotated using Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq and Illumina RNA-Seq data, identifying 30K putative protein coding genes, with an average of 3.9 transcripts per gene. Annotation of putative repeat elements highlighted an inverse relationship with gene density, and identified putative centromeres of the metacentric chromosomes. An enrichment of Helitron rolling circle transponsable elements was observed, suggesting their potential role in shaping the evolution of the C. gigas genome. This new chromosome-level assembly will be an enabling resource for genetics and genomics studies to support fundamental insight into bivalve biology, as well as for genetic improvement of C. gigas in aquaculture breeding programmes.

T1  - Nanomaterials and Their Interactive Behavior with Biomolecules, Cells, and Tissues
AN  - 2441954842
AB  - Nanoscience is a multidisciplinary area of science which enables researchers to create tools that help in understanding the mechanisms related to the interactions between nanomaterials and biomolecules (nanotechnology). Nanomaterials represent nanotechnology products. These products have an enormous impact on technical industries and the quality of human life. Nanomaterials directly or indirectly have to interact with biosystems. It is, therefore, essential to understand the beneficial and harmful interactions of nanomaterials with and within a biosystem, especially with reference to humans. This book provides primary and advanced information concerning the interactions between nanomaterials and the components of a typical biosystem to readers. Chapters in the book cover, in a topic-based approach, the many facets of nanomolecular interactions with biological molecules and systems that influence their behavior, bioavailability and biocompatibility (including nucleic acids, cell membranes, tissues, enzymes and antibodies). A note on the applications of nanomaterials is also presented in the conclusion of the book to illustrate the usefulness of this class of materials. The contents of the book will benefit students, researchers, and technicians involved in the fields of biological sciences, such as cell biology, medicine, molecular biology, food technology, cosmetology, pharmacology, biotechnology, and environmental sciences. The book also provides information for the material science personnel, enabling them to understand the basics of target-oriented nanomaterials design for specific objectives.

T1  - Spheres of Perception:&nbsp;Morality in a Post Technocratic Society
AN  - 2406459409
AB  - Our economic system is over-stimulated by the information age. Interconnection aids and abets companies earning trillions and their swift rise to global dominance. The 24-hour wired world has led to increased volatility; negative information, and even an accidental computer glitch can crash the market and create panic. Health, the environment, the welfare of society are pushed to the far edge of national interests. Instead, GDP and short-term monetary profit is prioritised over long-term impact on society and the environment. The world as we know it is set for collapse. Simultaneously, the science of evolution has itself evolved. In as much as "survival of the fittest" has been used to justify harsh, competition behaviour on the part of individuals and corporations, an updated understanding of evolution now tends to tell us a different story. What if written into the code of our DNA and RNA is a guide for telling us how to evolve morally and as a result improve our world and progress our epistemology? From such an understanding emerge new Spheres of Perception.

T1  - A Brief Natural History of Civilization:&nbsp;Why a Balance Between Cooperation and Competition Is Vital to Humanity
AN  - 2386309582
AB  - A compelling evolutionary narrative that reveals how human civilization follows the same ecological rules that shape all life on Earth Offering a bold new understanding of who we are, where we came from, and where we are going, noted ecologist Mark Bertness argues that human beings and their civilization are the products of the same self-organization, evolutionary adaptation, and natural selection processes that have created all other life on Earth. Bertness follows the evolutionary process from the primordial soup of two billion years ago through today, exploring the ways opposing forces of competition and cooperation have led to current assemblages of people, animals, and plants. Bertness's thoughtful examination of human history from the perspective of natural history provides new insights about why and how civilization developed as it has and explores how humans, as a species, might have to consciously overrule our evolutionary drivers to survive future challenges.

T1  - Genotoxic Effects of Etoposide, Bleomycin, and Ethyl Methanesulfonate on Cultured CHO Cells: Analysis by GC-MS/MS and Comet Assay
AN  - 2431761038
AB  - To evaluate methods for analysis of genotoxic effects on mammalian cell lines, we tested the effect of three common genotoxic agents on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). Suspension-grown CHO cells were separately incubated with etoposide, bleomycin, and ethyl methanesulfonate and analyzed by an alkaline comet assay and GC-MS/MS. Although DNA strand breaks were detected by the comet assay after treatment with all three agents, GC-MS/MS could only detect DNA nucleobase lesions oxidatively induced by bleomycin. This demonstrates that although GC-MS/MS has limitations in detection of genotoxic effects, it can be used for selected chemical genotoxins that contribute to oxidizing processes. The comet assay, used in combination with GC-MS/MS, can be a more useful approach to screen a wide range of chemical genotoxins as well as to monitor other DNA-damaging factors.

T1  - Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Family: A Stress Hormone-Receptor System’s Emerging Role in Mediating Sex-Specific Signaling
AN  - 2386074613
AB  - No organ in the body is impervious to the effects of stress, and a coordinated response from all organs is essential to deal with stressors. A dysregulated stress response that fails to bring systems back to homeostasis leads to compromised function and ultimately a diseased state. The components of the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) family, an ancient and evolutionarily conserved stress hormone-receptor system, helps both initiate stress responses and bring systems back to homeostasis once the stressors are removed. The mammalian CRF family comprises of four known agonists, CRF and urocortins (UCN1–3), and two known G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), CRF1 and CRF2. Evolutionarily, precursors of CRF- and urocortin-like peptides and their receptors were involved in osmoregulation/diuretic functions, in addition to nutrient sensing. Both CRF and UCN1 peptide hormones as well as their receptors appeared after a duplication event nearly 400 million years ago. All four agonists and both CRF receptors show sex-specific changes in expression and/or function, and single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with a plethora of human diseases. CRF receptors harbor N-terminal cleavable peptide sequences, conferring biased ligand properties. CRF receptors have the ability to heteromerize with each other as well as with other GPCRs. Taken together, CRF receptors and their agonists due to their versatile functional adaptability mediate nuanced responses and are uniquely positioned to orchestrate sex-specific signaling and function in several tissues.

T1  - OGG1 deficiency alters the intestinal microbiome and increases intestinal inflammation in a mouse model
AN  - 2337982357
AB  - OGG1-deficient (Ogg1-/-) animals display increased propensity to age-induced and diet-induced metabolic diseases, including insulin resistance and fatty liver. Since the intestinal microbiome is increasingly understood to play a role in modulating host metabolic responses, we examined gut microbial composition in Ogg1-/- mice subjected to different nutritional challenges. Interestingly, Ogg1-/- mice had a markedly altered intestinal microbiome under both control-fed and hypercaloric diet conditions. Several microbial species that were increased in Ogg1-/- animals were associated with increased energy harvest, consistent with their propensity to high-fat diet induced weight gain. In addition, several pro-inflammatory microbes were increased in Ogg1-/- mice. Consistent with this observation, Ogg1-/- mice were significantly more sensitive to intestinal inflammation induced by acute exposure to dextran sulfate sodium. Taken together, these data indicate that in addition to their proclivity to obesity and metabolic disease, Ogg1-/- mice are prone to colonic inflammation. Further, these data point to alterations in the intestinal microbiome as potential mediators of the metabolic and intestinal inflammatory response in Ogg1-/- mice.

T1  - Local Activism for Global Climate Justice:&nbsp;The Great Lakes Watershed
AN  - 2289789156
AB  - This book will inspire and spark grassroots action to address the inequitable impacts of climate change, by showing how this can be tackled and the many benefits of doing so. With contributions from climate activists and engaged young authors, this volume explores the many ways in which people are proactively working to advance climate justice. The book pays special attention to Canada and the Great Lakes watershed, showing how the effects of climate change span local, regional, and global scales through the impact of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, with related economic and social effects that cross political jurisdictions. Examining examples of local-level activism that include organizing for climate-resilient and equitable communities, the dynamic leadership of Indigenous peoples (especially women) for water and land protection, and diaspora networking, Local Activism for Global Climate Justice also provides theoretical perspectives on how individual action relates to broader social and political processes. Showcasing a diverse range of inspirational and thought-provoking case studies, this book will be of great interest to students and scholars of climate justice, climate change policy, climate ethics, and global environmental governance, as well as teachers and climate activists.

T1  - Nano and Bio-Based Technologies for Wastewater Treatment:&nbsp;Prediction and Control Tools for the Dispersion of Pollutants in the Environment
AN  - 2230112705
AB  - Presents recent challenges related to new forms of pollution from industries and discusses adequate state-of-the-art technologies capable to remediate such forms of pollution. 
Over the past few decades the boom in the industrial sector has contributed to the release in the environment of pollutants that have no regulatory status and which may have significant impact on the health of humans and animals. These pollutants also referred to as "emerging pollutants", are mostly aromatic compounds which derive from excretion of pharmaceutical, industrial effluents and municipal discharge. It is recurrent these days to find water treatment plants which no longer produce water that fits the purpose of domestic consumption based on newly established guidelines. This situation has prompted water authorities and researchers to develop tools for proper prediction and control of the dispersion of pollutants in the environment to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to prevent the occurrence of outbreaks due to sudden load of these pollutants in the water system. 
The chapters in this book cover a wide range of nano and bio-based techniques that have been designed for the real time detection of emerging contaminants in environmental water sources, geochemical models that are continuously improved for the prediction of inorganic contaminants migration from the mine solid wastes into ground and surface waters. Remediation strategies are also discussed and include effective techniques based on nanotechnology, advanced membrane filtration, oxidative and bio-degradation processes using various types of nanocatalysts, biocatalysts or supporting polymer matrices which are under advanced investigations for their implementation at large scale for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants from polluted water. 

Nano and Bio-Based Technologies for Wastewater Treatment: Prediction and Control Tools for the Dispersion of Pollutants in the Environment is divided is two sections. The first section covers the occurrence of emerging pollutants in environmental water while the second section covers state-of-the-art research on the removal of emerging pollutants from water using sustainable technologies. A total of 13 chapters addressing various topics related to the two sections are essentially based on recent developments in the respective field which could have a significant impact on the enhancement of the performance of wastewater treatment plants around the world, and especially in developing countries where access to clean and safe water remains a daily challenge. 

Audience 
This book will be of interest to researchers in the fields of Environment, Chemistry, Engineering, Biochemistry, Biotechnology, Mineralogy, Geochemistry as well as professionals including environmental managers, water treatment plants managers and operators, water authorities, government regulatory bodies officers and environmentalists.

T1  - Empowering youth currently underrepresented in STEM through authentic science research on local environmental challenges
AN  - 2451421502
AB  - For youth with limited role models in the STEM fields, and restricted summer research opportunities resulting from a lack of financial resources and academic connections, the opportunity to participate in academically connected, community based science research programs can be incredibly empowering. Providing these opportunities is critically important but it takes purposeful work, persistent outreach and strong community networks. We note that while providing these opportunities is incredibly rewarding, but there is a lot of work both up front and ongoing. This work is itself rewarding when networks are humming and enthusiasm for involvement is high, but it can be challenging when ceilings are hit and walls seem to arise unexpectedly. “Early Engagement in Research: Broadening participation through engagement in authentic science research” builds a regional network of summer research experiences for high school students underrepresented in STEM, starting from a successful model that has provided high school summer field research opportunities for New York City youth for over a decade (Secondary School Field Research Program). The program is developed around regional partnerships between various combinations of academic institutions and research centers, community environmental and education centers, state cooperative extensions, high schools and school networks, state and local park systems and land management groups. Each location has a unique approach, but all include some similar attributes. Each tackles an authentic science research issue that affects the local community such as microbiology in the local streams and microplastics in the local bays and biology, and each includes peer and near peer mentoring for the students along with a scientist mentor. Encouraging professional development of each student is central to the program. Technical instruction includes the use of scientific instruments and equipment, data recording and interpretation. Professional discussions include how to successfully read and dissect a science journal article, how to create and present a science poster and most importantly how build a network for themselves in STEM, and how to help us work with them to support the diversity that is needed for all of science to be inclusive and ultimately meet the needs of our future.

T1  - Energy budget changes in response to desiccation stress in Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae)
AN  - 2650301981
AB  - Humidity is probably the most important abiotic factor influencing life cycles, distribution, survival, and population dynamics of stored product pests. Although most of these pests can complete their life cycles in any given relative humidity, their prolonged development time, as well as decreased emergence rate and fecundity, have been well documented in several previous studies. In the present study, we evaluated the changes in energetic substances (lipids, soluble carbohydrates, glycogen, and proteins) accumulated in different life stages of larvae and adults of Tribolium castaneum in response to different relative humidity levels (5, 12, 22, 30, 45, and 65%). The results showed that young larvae were more susceptible to low relative humidity levels and desiccation stress. Larvae tended to accumulate higher proportions of lipids during earlier stages while their energy content shifted towards proteins with an increase in their age. Adult beetles experienced a significant decrease in their protein content immediately after they initiated reproduction. The importance of these fluctuations in the biology of the red flour beetles was discussed in detail.

Led by editors Siddhartha Thakur and Kalmia Kniel, a team of expert authors provides insights into critical themes surrounding preharvest food safety, including 
 
Challenges specific to meat, seafood, dairy, egg, produce, grain, and nut production 
Established and emerging foodborne and agriculture-related pathogens 
Influences of external factors such as climate change and the growing local-foods trend 
Regulatory issues from both US and EU perspectives 
Use of pre- and probiotics, molecular tools, mathematical modeling, and one health approaches  
Intended to encourage the scientific community and food industry stakeholders to advance their knowledge of the developments and challenges associated with preharvest food safety, this book addresses the current state of the field and provides a diverse array of chapters focused on a variety of food commodities and microbiological hazards.

T1  - Algal Bloom Expansion Increases Cyanotoxin Risk in Food
AN  - 2725240353
AB  - As advances in global transportation infrastructure make it possible for out of season foods to be available year-round, the need for assessing the risks associated with the food production and expanded distribution are even more important. Risks for foodborne illness are associated with contamination by bacteria, viruses, mold, parasites, natural and synthetic toxins, chemical residues, and conditions that lead to contamination. An increase in the popularity of natural alternatives to pharmaceuticals, herbal remedies and the desire for consuming “super foods” is leading to a change in the dietary patterns of consumers. Similarly, dietary trends are plentiful, with more consumers adopting changes with little medical guidance to dietary plans that are supported by inadequate scientific data. In particular, U.S. consumers are acquiring novel foods that may not be adequately checked for the presence of marine toxins and heat stable toxins in dry or minimally processed foods. Some dry foods cultivated in or processed in regions that may utilize hypoxic agricultural waters high in cyanobacterial or algal contamination. These may perpetuate increased risks for chronic liver, kidney, and neurodegenerative disorders due to intoxication from preventable foodborne agents. Global climate change, which has the effect of potentially expanding the toxic waters into higher latitudes, forecasts an increase in the risk of food contamination with toxins.

T1  - Regulatory Toxicology in the European Union
AN  - 2136147248
AB  - Consumer and environmental protection depend on the careful regulation of all classes of chemicals. Toxicology is the key science used to evaluate safety and so underpins regulatory decisions on chemicals. With the growing body of EU legislation involved in chemical regulation, there is a concomitant need to understand the toxicological principles underlying safety assessments. 
Regulatory Toxicology in the European Union is the first book to cover regulatory toxicology specifically in Europe. It addresses the need for a wider understanding of the principles of regulatory toxicology and their application and presents the relationship between toxicology and legislative processes in regulating chemical commodities across Europe. This title has a broad scope, covering historical and current chemical regulation in Europe, the role of European agencies and institutions, and also the use of toxicology data for important classes of chemicals, including human and veterinary medicines, animal feed and food additives, biocides, pesticides and nanomaterials. This book is therefore extremely pertinent and timely in the toxicology field at present. 
This book is an essential reference for regulatory authorities, industrialists, academics, undergraduates and postgraduates working within safety and hazards, toxicology, the biological sciences, and the medicinal and pharmaceutical sciences across the European Union.

T1  - Analysis of the ecological water diversion project in Wenzhou City
AN  - 2558727389
AB  - As a developed city in China, Wenzhou City has been suffered from bad water quality for years. In order to improve the river network water quality, an ecological water diversion project was designed and executed by the regional government. In this study, an investigation and analysis of the regional ecological water diversion project is made for the purpose of examining the water quality improvements. A numerical model is also established, different water diversion flow rates and sewer interception levels are considered during the simulation. Simulation results reveal that higher flow rate and sewer interception level will greatly improve the river network water quality in Wenzhou City. The importance of the flow rate and interception level has been proved and future work will be focused on increasing the flow rate and upgrading the sewer interception level.

T1  - Genetics of Bone Biology and Skeletal Disease
AN  - 2134736765
AB  - Genetics of Bone Biology and Skeletal Disease, Second Edition, is aimed at students of bone biology and genetics and includes general introductory chapters on bone biology and genetics. More specific disease orientated chapters comprehensively summarize the clinical, genetic, molecular, animal model, molecular pathology, diagnostic, counseling, and treatment aspects of each disorder. The book is organized into five sections that each emphasize a particular theme, general background to bone biology, general background to genetics and epigenetics, disorders of bone and joint, parathyroid and related disorders, and vitamin D and renal disorders. 
The first section is specifically devoted to providing an overview of bone biology and structure, joint and cartilage biology, principles of endocrine regulation of bone, and the role of neuronal regulation and energy homeostasis. The second section reviews the principles and progress of medical genetics and epigenetics related to bone disease, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS), genomic profiling, copy number variation, prospects of gene therapy, pharmacogenomics, genetic testing and counseling, as well as the generation and utilizing of mouse models. 
The third section details advances in the genetics and molecular biology of bone and joint diseases, both monogenic and polygenic, as well as skeletal dysplasias, and rarer bone disorders. The fourth section highlights the central role of the parathyroids in calcium and skeletal homeostasis by reviewing the molecular genetics of: hyperparathyroidism, hypoparathyrodism, endocrine neoplasias, and disorders of the PTH and calcium-sensing receptors. The fifth section details molecular and cellular advances across associated renal disorders such as vitamin D and rickets. 
 
Identifies and analyzes the genetic basis of bone disorders in humans and demonstrates the utility of mouse models in furthering the knowledge of mechanisms and evaluation of treatments 
Demonstrates how the interactions between bone and joint biology, physiology, and genetics have greatly enhanced the understanding of normal bone function as well as the molecular pathogenesis of metabolic bone disorders 
Summarizes the clinical, genetic, molecular, animal model, molecular pathology, diagnostic, counseling, and treatment aspects of each disorder

T1  - Analysis of Food Toxins and Toxicants
AN  - 2148438064
AB  - Food safety compromised by food toxins and toxicants is a widely discussed global issue. Over the past two decades, we have experienced various food crises and many of them have caused profound impacts on people's health and the business of food industry. In addition, the absence of well-developed food management and measurement systems inevitably lead to potentially life threatening exposures and resource waste. Provision of reliable measurement methods based on advanced and versatile technologies is an important prerequisite for investigating the cause of food poisoning incidents and preventing the occurrences of food catastrophes. 
Analysis of Food Toxins and Toxicants consists of five sections providing up-to-date descriptions of the analytical approaches used to detect a range of food toxins. Part I reviews the recent developments in analytical technology including sample pre-treatment and food additives. Part II covers the novel analysis of microbial and plant toxins including plant pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Part III focuses on marine toxins in fish and shellfish. Part IV discusses biogenic amines and common food toxicants, such as pesticides and heavy metals. Part V summarizes quality assurance and the recent developments in regulatory limits for toxins, toxicants and allergens, including discussions on laboratory accreditation and reference materials. 
This book provides a comprehensive review and practical guidance for scientists, analytical chemists and food scientists both in industry and academia, on how to choose the most appropriate and effective methodology and technology to identify food toxins and toxicants.

T1  - Handbook of Epigenetics:&nbsp;The New Molecular and Medical Genetics
AN  - 2135831730
AB  - Handbook of Epigenetics: The New Molecular and Medical Genetics, Second Edition, provides a comprehensive analysis of epigenetics, from basic biology, to clinical application. Epigenetics is considered by many to be the new genetics in that many biological phenomena are controlled, not through gene mutations, but rather through reversible and heritable epigenetic processes. These epigenetic processes range from DNA methylation to prions. The biological processes impacted by epigenetics are vast and encompass effects in lower organisms and humans that include tissue and organ regeneration, X-chromosome inactivation, stem cell differentiation, genomic imprinting, and aging. 
The first edition of this important work received excellent reviews; the second edition continues its comprehensive coverage adding more current research and new topics based on customer and reader reviews, including new discoveries, approved therapeutics, and clinical trials. From molecular mechanisms and epigenetic technology, to discoveries in human disease and clinical epigenetics, the nature and applications of the science is presented for those with interests ranging from the fundamental basis of epigenetics, to therapeutic interventions for epigenetic-based disorders. 
 
Timely and comprehensive collection of fully up-to-date reviews on epigenetics that are organized into one volume and written by leading figures in the field 
Covers the latest advances in many different areas of epigenetics, ranging from basic aspects, to technologies, to clinical medicine 
Written at a verbal and technical level that can be understood by scientists and college students 
Updated to include new epigenetic discoveries, newly approved therapeutics, and clinical trials

T1  - A Public Good Gone Bad
AN  - 1923970079
AB  - The fluctuations were unpredictable, after all, and rarely repeated, and the lake bore none of the familiar signs of dystopian ecology that I had come to associate with narratives about climate change-no beaches smeared with oil, no waters clouded with chemical waste.

[...]throughout my adolescence, Lake Michigan was visibly cleaner than it had been in decades-so clear, on some mornings, that its water could, if bottled, pass for vodka.

Cleveland's Cuyahoga River, which flows into Lake Erie, served as the dumping ground for the steel industry's runoff, and was for some time so slicked with oil that it would spontaneously burst into flames.

The nineteenth and early twentieth centuries were characterized by grandiose engineering projects-the Erie Canal, the Saint Lawrence Seaway, and the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal-that were designed to connect the Great Lakes to other bodies of water, carving new paths for commercial freighters.

[...]these manmade channels opened the doors to a host of invasive species that destroyed the lakes' native fish populations and led to several major die-offs.

[...]the number of American lakes and rivers listed as unsafe for swimming and fishing has since been cut in half.

T1  - Fish Viruses and Bacteria:&nbsp;Pathobiology and Protection
AN  - 2134547554
AB  - Taking a disease-based approach, Fish Viruses and Bacteria: Pathobiology and Protection focuses on the pathobiology of and protective strategies against the most common, major microbial pathogens of economically important marine and freshwater fish. The book covers well-studied, notifiable piscine viruses and bacteria, including new and emerging diseases which can become huge threats to local fish populations in new geographical regions if transported there via infected fish or eggs. A concise but thorough reference work, this book:- Covers key viral and bacterial diseases of notable fish species;- Reviews major well-established piscine pathogens as well as new, emerging and notifiable diseases; and- Contains the most up-to-date research contributed by a team of over fifty world experts.An invaluable bench book for fish health consultants, veterinarians and all those wanting instant access to information, this book is also a useful textbook for students specializing in fish health and research scientists initiating fish disease research programmes.Patrick T K Woo (ptkw) is University Professor Emeritus, University of Guelph, and has been a faculty member since 1974. His research program focused on parasitic flagellates which included those of medical and economic importance. The program had continuous NSERC support for over 40 years, until he closed his laboratory at U of G so he could, with his co-editors, focus on formulating and editing an interdisciplinary book series on 'climate change and fish health'. Patrick's research and travels, sponsored by other agencies (e.g. FAO, United Nations; National University of Singapore; CNPq, Brazil; MEC, Spain; NEC, Cdn.; CIDA, Cdn.; IDRC, Cdn) allowed him to work with colleagues in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas (e.g. 'determine the toxicity of cadmium on tilapia and its effects on immune response' in Singapore; 'develop and evaluate diagnostic techniques for human trypanosomiasis' in E & W Africa; 'adapt an in vitro method to study fish innate immunity' in Spain). In addition to publishing papers and review articles in journals and books, Patrick edited a special journal issue and 14 academic books on fish health. He also founded 'The Roy C Anderson Memorial Lecture in Parasitology'. He has also consulted to industry, universities and government agencies.

T1  - Neural Dynamics of Neurological Disease
AN  - 2134263396
AB  - The emerging understanding of age-related neurological disorders suggests that notions of a single causal gene/toxin being responsible is likely incorrect. Neurological disorders probably arise due to a unique intersection of multiple genetic and toxic factors, combined with additional contributions of age, stage of development, immune system actions, and more. This perspective leads to the view that rather than reflecting only one pathway to end-state disease, each is a spectrum disorder, and every individual case is therefore unique. 

Neural Dynamics of Neurological Disease argues for a fundamental rethinking of what we think we know about neurological disorders, how they arise and progress, and, crucially, what might be done to "cure" them. It first introduces the concept of neural dynamics of neurological disease, then examines various diseases and gives examples of the interplay of elements such as neural systems, cell types, and biochemical pathways that can contribute to disease. The concluding chapters point the way to how the emerging notion of neurological disease as a dynamic process may lead to more successful treatment options. 
Providing a cross-disciplinary approach to understanding the origin and progression of neurological disease, 
Neural Dynamics of Neurological Disease is a timely and valuable resource for neuroscientists, researchers, and clinicians.

T1  - ECOSYSTEM HEALTH ASSESSMENT OF MINING CITIES BASED ON LANDSCAPE PATTERN
AN  - 1987385982
AB  - Ecosystem health assessment (EHA) is one of the most important aspects in ecosystem management. Nowadays, ecological
environment of mining cities is facing various problems. In this study, through ecosystem health theory and remote sensing images in
2005, 2009 and 2013, landscape pattern analysis and Vigor-Organization-Resilience (VOR) model were applied to set up an
evaluation index system of ecosystem health of mining city to assess the healthy level of ecosystem in Panji District Huainan city.
Results showed a temporal stable but high spatial heterogeneity landscape pattern during 2005–2013. According to the regional
ecosystem health index, it experienced a rapid decline after a slight increase, and finally it maintained at an ordinary level. Among
these areas, a significant distinction was presented in different towns. It indicates that the ecosystem health of Tianjijiedao town, the
regional administrative centre, descended rapidly during the study period, and turned into the worst level in the study area. While the
Hetuan Town, located in the northwestern suburb area of Panji District, stayed on a relatively better level than other towns. The
impacts of coal mining collapse area, land reclamation on the landscape pattern and ecosystem health status of mining cities were
also discussed. As a result of underground coal mining, land subsidence has become an inevitable problem in the study area. In
addition, the coal mining subsidence area has brought about the destruction of the farmland, construction land and water bodies,
which causing the change of the regional landscape pattern and making the evaluation of ecosystem health in mining area more
difficult. Therefore, this study provided an ecosystem health approach for relevant departments to make scientific decisions.

T1  - Participatory Research in More-Than-Human Worlds
AN  - 2148355905
AB  - Socio-environmental crises are currently transforming the conditions for life on this planet, from climate change, to resource depletion, biodiversity loss and long-term pollutants. The vast scale of these changes, affecting land, sea and air have prompted calls for the 'ecologicalisation' of knowledge. This book adopts a much needed 'more-than-human' framework to grasp these complexities and challenges. It contains multidisciplinary insights and diverse methodological approaches to question how to revise, reshape and invent methods in order to work with non-humans in participatory ways. The book offers a framework for thinking critically about the promises and potentialities of participation from within a more-than-human paradigm, and opens up trajectories for its future development. It will be of interest to those working in the environmental humanities, animal studies, science and technology studies, ecology, and anthropology.

T1  - Archival Theory, Chronology and Interpretation of Rock Art in the Western Cape, South Africa
AN  - 2602661044
AB  - Since absolute dating of rock art is limited, relative chronologies remain useful in contextualising interpretations of ancient images. This book advocates the archival capacity of rock art and uses archival perspectives to analyse the chronology of paintings in order to formulate a framework for their historicised interpretations. The Western Cape painting sequence is customarily accepted to include the hunter-gatherer phase from c. 10,000 BP, pastoralism from c. 2,000 BP and finally the historical-cum-colonial period several centuries ago. Painting traditions with distinct depiction manners and content are conventionally linked to these broad periods. This study evaluates this schema in order to refine the diverse hunter-gatherer, herder and colonial era painting contexts and histories. Using superimpositions as one analytical tool, the notion of datum aided the referencing and correlation of layered imagery into a relative sequence. Although broad differences separate painting traditions, and these variations are generally indistinguishable within a single tradition, it is clear that the long-spanning hunter-gatherer segment of painting in this region reflects a hitherto unrecognised sub-tradition. Some painted themes such as elephants, fat-tailed sheep, handprints and possibly finger dots occur within various levels of the sequence, which this study views as shared graphic fragments occurring between and across traditions and sub-traditions. Through the archival concept of respect des fonds such observable complexities were clarified as coherent graphic narratives that run through the entire chronological sequence of the Western Cape rock paintings. Probing archaeological, ethnographic and historical sources revealed that while these themes remained fundamentally consistent throughout the stratigraphic sequence as preferred subject matter, their meanings might have transformed subliminally from earlier to later periods, possibly reflecting layered shifts in the socio-economic, cultural and political circumstances of the region. Fundamentally, the framework of image histories shown by the choice and sustenance of specific themes is understood to mean that their significance and specific graphic contexts throughout the chronological sequence are pivoted and mirrored through the long established hunter-gatherer rock paintings which predate periods of contact with other cultures. The resulting sequence and interpretation of these painted themes is a descriptive and organisational template reflecting the original organic character in the creation of the paintings and ordered cultural continuities in the use of animal/human symbolism. This book's agenda in part involves reviewing the Western Cape's changing social and historical landscape to show variation in painting over time and to project possible interpretative transformations. Painting sequences and cultural (dis)continuities are thus intricately entwined and can be disentangled through a recursive analytical relationship between archaeology, ethnography and history. This amalgamated analytical approach produces historicised narratives and contextual meanings for the rock paintings.

T1  - Garner's Modern English Usage
AN  - 2134161237
AB  - With more than a thousand new entries and more than 2,300 word-frequency ratios, the magisterial fourth edition of this book-now renamed Garner's Modern English Usage (GMEU)-reflects usage lexicography at its finest. Garner explains the nuances of grammar and vocabulary with thoroughness, finesse, and wit. He discourages whatever is slovenly, pretentious, or pedantic.GMEU is the liveliest and most compulsively readable reference work for writers of our time. It delights while providing instruction on skillful, persuasive, and vivid writing. Garner liberates English from two extremes: both from the hidebound "purists" who mistakenly believe that split infinitives and sentence-ending prepositions are malfeasances and from the linguistic relativists who believe that whatever people say or write must necessarily be accepted.The judgments here are backed up not just by a lifetime of study but also by an empirical grounding in the largest linguistic corpus ever available. In this fourth edition, Garner has made extensive use of corpus linguistics to include ratios of standard terms as compared against variants in modern print sources. No other resource provides as comprehensive, reliable, and empirical a guide to current English usage.For all concerned with writing and editing, GMEU will prove invaluable as a desk reference. Garner illustrates with actual examples, cited with chapter and verse, all the linguistic blunders that modern writers and speakers are prone to, whether in word choice, syntax, phrasing, punctuation, or pronunciation. No matter how knowledgeable you may already be, you're sure to learn from every single page of this book.

T1  - Climate Change and Microbial Ecology:&nbsp;Current Research and Future Trends
AN  - 2295116808
AB  - The distribution and function of microorganisms are of crucial importance for the flow of matter in the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. Effects of microbial communities on the carbon and nitrogen cycles are particularly important for producing climate gases such as CO2, CH4, or N2O. However, the biogeochemical cycles are reversely impacted by global climate change, for example by increasing temperature, increasing CO2concentration, or changing soil humidity. However microbes may respond differently, by accelerating or by alleviating, human-caused climate change. Understanding of microbial ecology in the different ecosystems on Earth, such as soil, oceans, or inland waters, is essential for our ability to assess the importance of biogeochemical cycles-climate feedbacks. Unfortunately, microbial communities are extremely complex in structure and function and can be affected by climate and other global changes in many ways, which impedes our ability to draw reliable conclusions. In this book, a broad range of renowned scientists reviews the most important hot-topics in the area of climate change and microbial ecology, thus providing a timely and authoritative overview of this increasingly important area. Individual chapters cover the various ecosystems on Earth as well as the different groups of microorganisms with respect to different cycles of matter. In addition, special chapters cover applied aspects, such as land-use and geoengineering. This is an essential book for every microbial ecologist from the PhD student to the experienced scientist and is also recommended for everyone interested in the field of global climate change.

T1  - Eisenhower's Guerrillas:&nbsp;The Jedburghs, the Maquis, and the Liberation of France
AN  - 2134812352
AB  - The challenges facing General Dwight Eisenhower before the Invasion of Normandy were not merely military but political as well. He knew that to liberate France, and to hold it, the Allies needed local help, which would necessitate coordinating with the highly independent French resistance groups known collectively as the maquis. The Allies' objective was to push the Germans out of France. The French objective, on the other hand, was a France free of all foreign armies, including the Allies. President Roosevelt refused to give full support to Charles de Gaulle, whom he mistrusted, and declined to supply the timing, location, and other key details of Operation Overlord to his Free French government. Eisenhower's hands were tied. He needed to involve the French, but without simultaneously involving them in operational planning.Into this atmosphere of tension and confusion jumped teams consisting of three officers each -- one from the British Special Operations Bureau, one from the U.S. Office of Strategic Services, one from the Free French Bureau Central de Renseignement -- as well as a radioman from any one of the three nations. Known as the Jedburghs, their primary purpose was to serve as liaisons to the maquis, working to arm, train, and equip them. They were to incite guerilla warfare.Benjamin Jones' Eisenhower's Guerrillas is the first book to show in detail how the Jedburghs -- whose heroism and exploits have been widely celebrated -- and the maquis worked together. Underscoring the critical and often overlooked role that irregular warfare played in Allied operations on the Continent, it tells the story of the battle for and liberation of France and the complexities that threatened to undermine the operation before it even began.

T1  - PHF13 is a molecular reader and transcriptional co-regulator of H3K4me2/3
AN  - 1953749749
AB  - PHF13 is a chromatin affiliated protein with a functional role in differentiation, cell division, DNA damage response and higher chromatin order. To gain insight into PHF13's ability to modulate these processes, we elucidate the mechanisms targeting PHF13 to chromatin, its genome wide localization and its molecular chromatin context. Size exclusion chromatography, mass spectrometry, X-ray crystallography and ChIP sequencing demonstrate that PHF13 binds chromatin in a multivalent fashion via direct interactions with H3K4me2/3 and DNA, and indirectly via interactions with PRC2 and RNA PolII. Furthermore, PHF13 depletion disrupted the interactions between PRC2, RNA PolII S5P, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 and resulted in the up and down regulation of genes functionally enriched in transcriptional regulation, DNA binding, cell cycle, differentiation and chromatin organization. Together our findings argue that PHF13 is an H3K4me2/3 molecular reader and transcriptional co-regulator, affording it the ability to impact different chromatin processes.DOI:

T1  - On the Ultrastructure and Function of Rhogocytes from the Pond Snail Lymnaea stagnalis
AN  - 1725018473
AB  - Rhogocytes, also termed “pore cells”, occur as solitary or clustered cells in the connective tissue of gastropod molluscs. Rhogocytes possess an enveloping lamina of extracellular matrix and enigmatic extracellular lacunae bridged by cytoplasmic bars that form 20 nm diaphragmatic slits likely to act as a molecular sieve. Recent papers highlight the embryogenesis and ultrastructure of these cells, and their role in heavy metal detoxification. Rhogocytes are the site of hemocyanin or hemoglobin biosynthesis in gastropods. Based on electron microscopy, we recently proposed a possible pathway of hemoglobin exocytosis through the slit apparatus, and provided molecular evidence of a common phylogenetic origin of molluscan rhogocytes, insect nephrocytes and vertebrate podocytes. However, the previously proposed secretion mode of the respiratory proteins into the hemolymph is still rather hypothetical, and the possible role of rhogocytes in detoxification requires additional data. Although our previous study on rhogocytes of the red-blooded (hemoglobin-containing) freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata provided much new information, a disadvantage was that the hemoglobin molecules were not unequivocally defined in the electron microscope. This made it difficult to trace the exocytosis pathway of this protein. Therefore, we have now performed a similar study on the rhogocytes of the blue-blooded (hemocyanin-containing) freshwater snail Lymnaea stagnalis. The intracellular hemocyanin could be identified in the electron microscope, either as individual molecules or as pseudo-crystalline arrays. Based on 3D-electron microscopy, and supplemented by in situ hybridization, immunocytochemistry and stress response experiments, we provide here additional details on the structure and hemocyanin biosynthesis of rhogocytes, and on their response in animals under cadmium and starvation stress. Moreover, we present an advanced model on the release of synthesized hemocyanin molecules through the slit apparatus into the hemolymph, and the uptake of much smaller particles such as cadmium ions from the hemolymph through the slit apparatus into the cytoplasm.

T1  - Taxonomy of Australian Mammals
AN  - 2135653434
AB  - Taxonomy of Australian Mammals utilises the latest morphometric and genetic research to develop the most up to date and comprehensive revision of the taxonomy of Australian mammals undertaken to date. It proposes significant changes to the higher ranks of a number of groups and recognises several genera and species that have only very recently been identified as distinct. This easy to use reference also includes a complete listing of all species, subspecies and synonyms for all of Australia's mammals, both native and introduced as well as terrestrial and marine. 
This book lays a foundation for future taxonomic work and identifies areas where taxonomic studies should be targeted, not only at the species and subspecies level but also broader phylogenetic relationships. This work will be an essential reference for students, scientists, wildlife managers and those interested in the science of taxonomy.

T1  - You think UFOs don't really exist?: You'll think again after hearing Tom Stohlgren on 'Unwanted foreign organisms'
AN  - 1661543061
AB  - He didn't think much of it at the time, intent as he was on researching what was then "the" big environmental concern. But today, acid rain, while still a serious environmental concern, has moved from the front pages as industries install scrubbers and technology improves. [Tom Stohlgren] now devotes his professional life to fighting invasive species, which he believes represent the most serious environmental threat of the 21st century.              The economic cost, of trying to contain the invaders, of decreased crop production and the need for increased and new pesticides, of losses of forest resources, is estimated at $120 billion a year in the United States. "That's more than fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, all natural disasters combined, and yet our effort isn't there," Stohlgren said.              While some might argue that change is normal and that it shouldn't be surprising to see some species die out, Stohlgren says the loss of biodiversity has a real cost. "One-quarter of your pharmaceuticals come from pretty rare species in the tropical rain forests," he says. When an invader pushes out a native species, it might be killing off the next promising cancer-fighting drug.

T1  - Anthropology:&nbsp;Current and Future Developments Volume 1:The First Mariners
AN  - 2141116420
AB  - This volume summarizes the history and findings of the First Mariners Project, which the author, Robert G. Bednarik, commenced in 1996 in order to explore the Ice Age origins of seafaring. This is the largest archaeological replication project ever undertaken with several hundred people involved in the construction of eight primitive vessels with stone tools under scientifically controlled conditions, six of them sailing. Four bamboo rafts have succeeded in accomplishing the historically documented crossings they sought to replicate. One of the successful experiments, a 1000 kilometer journey to Australia in 1998, attempted to recreate the first human arrival in Australia, probably around 60,000 years ago. Other voyages attempted to address the much earlier sea crossings documented to have taken place in the islands of Indonesia, the earliest of which may have occurred nearly a million years ago. These experiments have also featured in BBC and National Geographic documentaries. The First Mariners comprehensively describes the archaeological background and relevant issues of the project and features an extensive pictorial record, of both the experiments and the archaeological basis of this research – giving a unique experience to readers interested in understanding the earliest marine adventurers from a historical and technical perspective.

T1  - Total-Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence Analysis and Related Methods
AN  - 2132030890
AB  - Total-reflection X-ray fluorescence, or TXRF, and its related methods have been used increasingly for multi element analysis in laboratories and industry worldwide. Providing reliable, economical readings of the minute mass or extremely low concentration of elements, TXRF is especially suitable for ultramicro- and trace analysis. It is also effective in the analysis of flat sample surfaces and stratified near-surface layers, offering a nondestructive means of quality control of wafers for the semiconductor industry by a fast mapping of possible unwanted contaminations.
 
 The new edition is completely updated and nearly doubled. Particular emphasis has been placed on new methods and techniques including: Silicon-drift detector with Peltier-cooling, powerful and particular excitation by synchrotron radiation, simple wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectrometer especially for light element detection and speciation, TXRF after chemical and physical etching of thin layers to give information on the nanometer-scale, GI-XRF for non-destructive depth profiling of thin flat coverings and implantations, TXRF combined with EXAFS, XANES, XRD, and XPS to gain insight into the molecular and even into the electronic structure of atoms. 
 Total-Reflection X-Ray Fluorescence Analysis helps professionals evaluate the suitability of this method to their specific needs, pinpoint new applications, and gain insight into the future of TXRF. It is an excellent text for graduate students and a useful guide for scientists and technicians in a wide range of fields.
 
 Total-Reflection X-ray Fluorescence Analysis and Related Methods, Second Edition features:
 
 
The uses of TXRF in ultramicro- and trace analysis, and in surface- and near-surface-layer analysis 
Instrumentation and setups, particularly high-power X-ray sources, beam-adapting units, sample positioning, and energy-dispersive detection and registration 
Explores new applications of TRXF since the publication of the first edition 
Offers helpful tips on performing analyses, including sample preparations, and spectra recording and interpretation 
Includes about 700 references for further study  
Written by leading experts in X-ray spectral analysis, the second edition provides an overview of the field, reveals the advantages of TXRF over competing methods, and describes its application in numerous fields, including biology, biomonitoring, material and life sciences, medicine, toxicology, forensics, art history, and archaeometry.

T1  - The Sea Cucumber Apostichopus Japonicus:&nbsp;History, Biology and Aquaculture
AN  - 2133244282
AB  - While sea cucumber is one of China's and AsiaOCOs most prized seafoods, and aquaculture programs are being developed on a huge commercial scale, Chinese expertise and knowledge in this area has not been well disseminated worldwide. "The Sea Cucumber Apostichopus japonicus "is the first book to bridge this gap by compiling key information related to hatchery and aquaculture techniques, nutritional and medical values, markets, and trade flow of the number one sea cucumber species. It summarizes the historical and most recent developments in the trade and aquaculture of "Apostichopus japonicus," as well as important aspects of its anatomy, population dynamics, reproduction, development, physiology, and biochemistry. With sea cucumber harvest and aquaculture booming worldwide, comprehensive knowledge of ChinaOCOs technological breakthroughs in this rapidly expanding field is key. "The Sea Cucumber Apostichopus japonicus "is essential to understanding the cultural underpinnings of the insatiable market demands for sea cucumber and what drives sea cucumber trade. It also provides biological information and aquaculture techniques that can be adapted to other species, making it a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners involved in sea cucumber harvesting, aquaculture, and conservation.

T1  - Films on Ice:&nbsp;Cinemas of the Arctic
AN  - 2673003271
AB  - The first book to address the vast diversity of Northern circumpolar cinemas from a transnational perspective, Films on Ice: Cinemas of the Arctic presents the region as one of great and previously overlooked cinematic diversity. With chapters on polar explorer films, silent cinema, documentaries, ethnographic and indigenous film, gender and ecology, as well as Hollywood and the USSR's uses and abuses of the Arctic, this book provides a groundbreaking account of Arctic cinemas from 1898 to the present. Challenging dominant notions of the region in popular and political culture, it demonstrates how moving images (cinema, television, video, and digital media) have been central to the very definition of the Arctic since the end of the nineteenth century. Bringing together an international array of European, Russian, Nordic, and North American scholars, Films on Ice radically alters stereotypical views of the Arctic region, and therefore of film history itself.Scott MacKenzie teaches in the Department of Film and Media, and is cross-appointed to the Graduate Program in Cultural Studies, at Queen's University, CanadaAnna Westerståhl Stenport is Associate Professor of Scandinavian Studies and Media and Cinema Studies, and Director of the European Union Center, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

T1  - Rural Tourism:&nbsp;An International Perspective
AN  - 2131766530
AB  - Rural regions are experiencing fundamental challenges to their ways of life and social fabric, as traditional land-based occupations are in decline and younger and better-educated rural residents migrate to cities for greater work, social and cultural opportunities. Rural tourism offers a possible solution to the problems associated with lost economic opportunities and population decline that accompany the waning of agriculture. Many governments and regional authorities have embraced rural tourism as an opportunity to bring new money into rural regions, stimulating growth, providing employment opportunities and thus beginning to halt rural decline. However, the possibilities of rural tourism to promote rural regeneration have been criticised for being over-stated and unrealistic. Rural tourism has frequently been found to under-deliver in terms of expected economic benefits and job creation, and may sometimes exacerbate local hierarchies and inequalities. This edited collection questions the contribution tourism can and does make to rural regions. Drawing on a range of geographically diverse, research-driven case studies, the book is thematically organised to explore a variety of issues relevant to rural tourism, from the perspectives of local communities, businesses, government/policy makers and the tourists themselves.

AB  - "It's piecemeal. We have over 20 pieces of legislation that touch on invasive species, but there are gaps," [Kathryn McGarry] said.              "This way, we won't be left with a situation where a threat is identified, and the province can't act on it," McGarry said. "It would allow the province to act ahead of time. It's much cheaper to catch a problem in its earlier stages than to deal with it later."              "We're already spending tens of millions of dollars on the damages to our environmental areas," she said. "This would help prevent the spread of more harmful plant, animal and fish species in Ontario."

T1  - Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering in Dental Sciences
AN  - 2141093220
AB  - "Stem Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering in Dental Sciences" bridges the gap left by many tissue engineering and stem cell biology titles to highlight the significance of translational research in this field in the medical sciences. It compiles basic developmental biology with keen focus on cell and matrix biology, stem cells with relevance to tissue engineering biomaterials including nanotechnology and current applications in various disciplines of dental sciences; viz., periodontology, endodontics, oral & craniofacial surgery, dental implantology, orthodontics & dentofacial orthopedics, organ engineering and transplant medicine. In addition, it covers research ethics, laws and industrial pitfalls that are of particular importance for the future production of tissue constructs. 
Tissue Engineering is an interdisciplinary field of biomedical research, which combines life, engineering and materials sciences, to progress the maintenance, repair and replacement of diseased and damaged tissues. This ever-emerging area of research applies an understanding of normal tissue physiology to develop novel biomaterial, acellular and cell-based technologies for clinical and non-clinical applications. As evident in numerous medical disciplines, tissue engineering strategies are now being increasingly developed and evaluated as potential routine therapies for oral and craniofacial tissue repair and regeneration. 
 Diligently covers all the aspects related to stem cell biology and tissue engineering in dental sciences: basic science, research, clinical application and commercialization.

T1  - The Recent and Fossil Meet Kempf Database Ostracoda:&nbsp;Festschrift Eugen Karl Kempf - Proceedings of the 15th International German Ostracodologists' Meeting
AN  - 2130992584
AB  - The 
Festschrift Eugen Karl Kempf is a proceedings volume of the 15th International German Ostracodologists' Meeting which was held October 11th to 14th, 2012 by the Institute of Geology and Mineralogy of the University of Cologne. The selected contributions cover a broad range of biological and palaeontological topics that rely on sound taxonomy and serve as a tribute to the Kempf Database of Ostracoda including a biography on Eugen Karl Kempf.
 
 In detail, the scientific contributions are covering freshwater and marine genera/species and the parasitic family Entocytherids. Revisions of genera and descriptions of new species are one focus, but also new studies on biogeography, ecology and morphology add to the value of the proceeding.

T1  - Science and Politics:&nbsp;An a-To-Z Guide to Issues and Controversies
AN  - 2134519977
AB  - Recent partisan squabbles over science in the news are indicative of a larger tendency for scientific research and practice to get entangled in major ideological divisions in the public arena. This politicization of science is deepened by the key role government funding plays in scientific research and development, the market leading position of U.S.-based science and technology firms, and controversial U.S. exports (such as genetically modified foods or hormone-injected livestock). 
This groundbreaking, one-volume, A-to-Z reference features 120-150 entries that explore the nexus of politics and science, both in the United States and in U.S. interactions with other nations. The essays, each by experts in their fields, examine:  
 
Health, environmental, and social/cultural issues relating to science and politics  
Concerns relating to government regulation and its impact on the practice of science  
Key historical and contemporary events that have shaped our contemporary view of how science and politics intersect   

 

 Science and Politics: An A to Z Guide to Issues and Controversies is a must-have resource for researchers and students who seek to deepen their understanding of the connection between science and politics.

AB  - Encyclopedia of Caribbean Archaeology offers a comprehensive overview of the available archaeological research conducted in the region. 
Beginning with the earliest native migrations and moving through contemporary issues of heritage management, the contributors tackle the usual questions of colonization, adaptation, and evolution while embracing newer research techniques, such as geoinformatics, archaeometry, paleodemography, DNA analysis, and seafaring simulations. Entries are cross-referenced so that readers can efficiently access data on a variety of related topics. 
The introduction includes a survey of the various archaeological periods in the Caribbean, as well as a discussion of the region's geography, climate, topography, and oceanography. It also offers an easy-to-read review of the historical archaeology, providing a better understanding of the cultural contexts of the Caribbean that resulted from the convergence of European, Native American, African, and then Asian settlers.

The most advanced information regarding the molecular mechanisms of action of major groups of toxins is presented, to frame for the description of toxic responses found in living systems exposed to microalgal toxins. Accounts of the recognized environmental effects of harmful algal blooms and the existing therapeutic applications of some toxins have been included. The picture is completed by the description of current initiatives to manage the risks posed by toxic microalgae, including strategies for the detoxification of contaminated seafood and the efforts to use most advanced informatic tools for the development of models for robust predictions regarding the appearance and the dynamics of harmful algal blooms. The complexity of risk management in the field is presented from a global perspective by highlighting major issues approached in world regions whose economic importance with regard to the production and commercialization of seafood is undeniable."

It began when a 4,000-square-mile area of Arizona desert called Black Mesa was divided between the Hopi and Navajo tribes. To the outside world, it was a land struggle between two fractious Indian tribes; to political insiders and energy corporations, it was a divide-and-conquer play for the 21 billion tons of coal beneath Black Mesa. Today, that coal powers cheap electricity for Los Angeles, a new water aqueduct into Phoenix, and the neon dazzle of Las Vegas. Journalist and historian Judith Nies has been tracking this story for nearly four decades. She follows the money and tells us the true story of wealth and water, mendacity, and corruption at the highest levels of business and government. Amid the backdrop of the breathtaking desert landscape, Unreal City shows five cultures collidingHopi, Navajo, global energy corporations, Mormons, and US government agenciesresulting in a battle over resources and the future of the West. Las Vegas may attract 39 million visitors a year, but the tourists mesmerized by the dancing water fountains at the Bellagio don’t ask where the water comes from. They don’t see a city with the nation’s highest rates of foreclosure, unemployment, and suicide. They don’t see the astonishing drop in the water level of Lake Meadwhere Sin City gets 90 percent of its water supply. Nies shows how the struggle over Black Mesa lands is an example of a global phenomenon in which giant transnational corporations have the power to separate indigenous people from their energy-rich lands with the help of host governments. Unreal City explores how and why resources have been taken from native lands, what it means in an era of climate change, and why, in this city divorced from nature, the only thing more powerful than money is water.

T1  - Biomineralization Sourcebook:&nbsp;Characterization of Biominerals and Biomimetic Materials
AN  - 2140973708
AB  - Elaine DiMasi is a physicist and synchrotron x-ray scattering expert, and has made her career at Brookhaven National Laboratory since 1996. Research for her PhD (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor) and postdoctoral appointment (BNL) focused on structure and electronic properties in metallic condensed matter systems. Since 1999 she has investigated numerous aspects of Biomineralization including: mineralization at Langmuir films, assembly and mineralization of extracellular matrix proteins, structures of organics assembled on mineral surfaces, and microbeam diffraction mapping of mineral-organic composites and biological minerals. More recent areas of interest include lipid-mineral interactions and soft X-ray microspectroscopy. DiMasi currently is engaged in building a state of the art synchrotron x-ray scattering facility at the National Synchrotorn Light Source II, dedicated to soft- and bio-materials, specializing in aqueous interfaces, providing the capabilities to measure hierarchical structures of biominerals for a wide range of length scales and in realistic material environments. 
Laurie B. Gower is an Associate Professor in the Department of Materials Science & Engineering, and supervisor of the Biomimetics Laboratory at the University of Florida. Her Master's degree from University of Utah was in the area of Bioengineering (1990), and doctoral degree from UMASS at Amherst was in the area of Polymer Science & Engineering (1997). In the latter case, her dissertation was focused on biomineralization, making use of model systems to examine the interactions between polypeptides and crystal growth, and correlating features observed in the in vitro systems to those observed in biominerals. Most of the research in her academic career has continued along these lines of examining potential mechanisms involved in biomineralization. She discovered a novel crystallization process that relies on a polymer-induc

AN  - 2135694024
AB  - This is the third in a series of catalogs and bibliographies of the Cicadoidea covering 1981-2010. The work summarizes the cicada literature, providing a means for easy access to information previously published on a particular species or to allow researchers the ability to locate similar work that has been published on other species. A total of 2,591 references are included in the bibliography. The book is a source of biological and systematic information that could be used by zoologists, entomologists, individuals interested in crop protection, and students studying entomology as well as anyone interested in cicadas or who require specific information on the insects. Each genus/species is identified with the reference, the page number, any figures (if applicable), the topics covered by the reference, any synonymies, and any biogeographic information mentioned for the species in the individual reference. An added benefit to the catalog is that it is the first complete species list for the Cicadoidea, including all synonymies and new combinations through 2012. 
Provides nearly four times the number of references of the previous catalog, demonstrating the explosion of data since that timeContains all references found that mention a genus or species name in the workIncludes more than 300 additional references that were not in the two previous works on this subjectFeatures the first complete species list for the Cicadoidea, including all synonymies

T1  - The Applicability of Oxidative Stress Biomarkers in Assessing Chromium Induced Toxicity in the Fish Labeo rohita
AN  - 1566084270
AB  - The evaluation of metal's toxicity in freshwater is one of the imperative areas of research and there is an emergent concern on the development of techniques for detecting toxic effects in aquatic animals. Oxidative stress biomarkers are very useful in assessing the health of aquatic life and more in depth studies are necessary to establish an exact cause effect relationship. Therefore, to study the effectiveness of this approach, a laboratory study was conducted in the fish Labeo rohita as a function of hexavalent chromium and the toxicity indices using a battery of oxidative stress biomarkers such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione reductase (GR) in the liver, muscle, gills, and brain have been studied along with biometric parameters, behavioral changes, and Cr bioaccumulation. A significant increased HSI was observed in contrast to CF which reduced significantly. SOD, CAT, and GR activity increased significantly in all the tissues of treated fishes. The bioaccumulation of Cr was highest in liver followed by gills, muscle, and brain. This study highlights the significance of using a set of integrated biomarker and advocate to include these parameters in National Water Quality Monitoring Program in areas potentially polluted with metals to assess the health of the ecosystem.

T1  - The Laws of Nature:&nbsp;Reflections on the Evolution of Ecosystem Management Law & Policy
AN  - 2131920748
AB  - This timely collection written by an interdisciplinary array of law professors, who specialize in legal and policy issues surrounding ecosystem management, and scholars and practitioners in areas such as environmental policy and planning, conservation, economics, and biology explore why ecosystems must be valued and managed in their own right. The importance of ecosystems has been underestimated. We cannot simply hope ecosystems will benefit from legislation focused on other environmental and natural resource protections, such as those for wildlife, trees, air and water. An ecosystem, a community of organisms together with their physical environment, viewed as a system of interacting and interdependent relationships, has its own intricate administrative issues. Edited by Kalyani Robbins, a law professor, The Laws of Nature investigates how ecosystems function, their value to humans and wildlife, and what factors affect ecosystems' survival. This analysis is coupled with cutting-edge theories and regulatory proposals from legal scholars who study ecosystem questions. In the end, a thorough and multi-disciplinary understanding of the importance of ecosystem is presented.

T1  - Maternal Investment in the Swordtail Fish Xiphophorus multilineatus: Support for the Differential Allocation Hypothesis
AN  - 1466173648
AB  - The differential allocation hypothesis predicts that reproductive investment will be influenced by mate attractiveness, given a cost to reproduction and a tradeoff between current and future reproduction. We tested the differential allocation hypothesis in the swordtail fish Xiphophorus multilineatus, where males have genetically influenced (patroclinous inheritance) alternative mating tactics (ARTs) maintained by a tradeoff between being more attractive to females (mature later as larger courting males) and a higher probability of reaching sexual maturity (mature earlier as smaller sneaker males). Males in X. multilineatus do not provide parental care or other resources to the offspring. Allelic variation and copy number of the Mc4R gene on the Y-chromosome influences the size differences between males, however there is no variation in this gene on the X-chromosome. Therefore, to determine if mothers invested more in offspring of the larger courter males, we examined age to sexual maturity for daughters. We confirmed a tradeoff between number of offspring and female offspring’s age to sexual maturity, corroborating that there is a cost to reproduction. In addition, the ART of their fathers significantly influenced the age at which daughters reached sexual maturity, suggesting increased maternal investment to daughters of courter males. The differential allocation we detected was influenced by how long the wild-caught mother had been in the laboratory, as there was a brood order by father genotype (ART) interaction. These results suggest that females can adjust their reproductive investment strategy, and that differential allocation is context specific. We hypothesize that one of two aspects of laboratory conditions produced this shift: increased female condition due to higher quality diet, and/or assessment of future mating opportunities due to isolation from males.

T1  - Age and growth in three populations of Dosinia exoleta (Bivalvia: Veneridae) from the Portuguese coast
AN  - 1459946634
AB  - The present study aimed at estimating the age and growth in three populations of Dosinia exoleta from the Portuguese coast (Aveiro in the north, Setúbal in the southwest and Faro in the south). Two techniques were compared to ascertain the most suitable method for ageing D. exoleta. Growth marks on the shell surface and acetate peel replicas of sectioned shells were the techniques applied. Two hypotheses were tested: growth parameters present latitudinal variation along the Portuguese coast; growth parameters are influenced by the fishing exploitation. Shell surface rings proved inappropriate for ageing this species, whereas acetate peels provided realistic estimates of the von Bertalanffy growth parameters (K, L ^sub ∞^ and t ^sub 0^). A latitudinal gradient in growth rate was detected, with a clear southward increase in the growth coefficient (K) of D. exoleta (Faro > Setúbal and Aveiro) indicating that warmer waters in southern Portugal provide optimal conditions for the growth of this species. Fishing exploitation in northern Portugal targets larger individuals and leaves behind a younger population of smaller individuals, decreasing the asymptotic shell length (L ^sub ∞^) of D. exoleta from Aveiro. The overall growth performance was compared among populations of D. exoleta and with other venerid species worldwide.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Peace-Athabasca Delta:&nbsp;Portrait of a Dynamic Ecosystem
AN  - 2136017605
AB  - "In the delta, water is boss, change is the only constant, and creation and destruction exist side by side." The Peace-Athabasca Delta in northern Alberta is a globally significant wetland that lies within one of the largest unfragmented landscapes in North America. Arguably the world's largest boreal inland delta, it is renowned for its biological productivity and is a central feature of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Yet the delta and its indigenous cultures lie downstream of Alberta's bitumen sands, whose exploitation comprises one of the largest industrial projects in the world. Kevin Timoney provides an authoritative synthesis of the science and history of the delta, describing its ecology, unraveling its millennia-long history, and addressing its uncertain future. Scientists, students, leaders in the energy sector, government officials and policy makers, and conscientious citizens everywhere should read this lively work.

T1  - Onomastics in Contemporary Public Space
AN  - 2131139560
AB  - Onomastics in Contemporary Public Space aims at analysing names and name-giving from an intercultural perspective, within the context of contemporary public space. As was the case of Name and Naming: Synchronic and Diachronic Perspectives (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012), the geographical areas investigated in the studies included in this volume are very diverse, referring not only to European cultural space, but also to American, Asian, African and Australian contexts. Being a collective work, the book brings together 49 specialists from 18 countries; namely Australia, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, the United Kingdom and the USA. Thematically, the volume is organised so that it may cover all the dimensions of public space, as far as onomastics is concerned. The specific areas studied are: the theory of names; names of public places (linguistic landscapes); names of public, economic, cultural, religious and sports institutions (names of business establishments, religious institutions – places of worship – and cultural associations, as well as names in journals and magazines); names of objects/entities resulting from various processes in public space (names of foods, drinks and food brands, code names of collaborators in secret service organisations, names in literature, nicknames/bynames/pseudonyms in the world of politics, high life, art and sport, names in virtual space, and zoonyms); and miscellanea. The originality and topicality of the subject lie in the multidisciplinary viewpoint adopted in the research, in which onomastics merges with adjacent linguistic disciplines, such as sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics and pragmatics, as well as other sciences, such as history, literature, anthropology, politics, economy and religion.

T1  - Modernisation of Chinese Culture:&nbsp;Continuity and Change
AN  - 2131947168
AB  - The editors are grateful to the Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation for its generous support of their research work which enabled them to publish the present book. The present book carefully maps the Chinese modernisation discourse, highlighting its relationship to other, similar discourses, and situating it within historical and theoretical contexts. In contrast to the majority of recent discussions of a “Chinese development model” that tend to focus more on institutional then cultural factors, and are more narrowly concerned with economic matters than overall social development, the book offers several important focal points for many presently overlooked issues and dilemmas. The multifaceted perspectives contained in this anthology are not limited to economic, social, and ecological issues, but also include political and social functions of ideologies and cultural conditioned values, representing the axial epistemological grounds of modern Chinese society. 2011 was the 100th anniversary of the Xinhai Revolution. The centennial is relevant not only in terms of state ideology, but also plays a significant role within academic research into Chinese society and culture. This historic turning point likewise represents the symbolic and concrete linkages and tensions between tradition and modernity, progress and conservatism, traditional values and the demands for adjustment to contemporary societies. The book shows that Chinese transition from tradition to modernity cannot be understood in a framework of a unified general model of society, but rather through a more complex insight into the interrelations among elements of physical environment, social structure, philosophy, history, and culture.

T1  - Invertebrate Learning and Memory
AN  - 2134996762
AB  - Understanding how memories are induced and maintained is one of the major outstanding questions in modern neuroscience. This is difficult to address in the mammalian brain due to its enormous complexity, and invertebrates offer major advantages for learning and memory studies because of their relative simplicity. Many important discoveries made in invertebrates have been found to be generally applicable to higher organisms, and the overarching theme of the proposed will be to integrate information from different levels of neural organization to help generate a complete account of learning and memory. 
Edited by two leaders in the field, "Invertebrate Learning and Memory "will offer a current and comprehensive review, with chapters authored by experts in each topic. The volume will take a multidisciplinary approach, exploring behavioral, cellular, genetic, molecular, and computational investigations of memory. Coverage will include comparative cognition at the behavioral and mechanistic level, developments in concepts and methodologies that will underlie future advancements, and mechanistic examples from the most important vertebrate systems (nematodes, molluscs, and insects). Neuroscience researchers and graduate students with an interest in the neural control of cognitive behavior will benefit, as will as will those in the field of invertebrate learning. 
Presents an overview of invertebrate studies at the molecular / cellular / neural levels and correlates findings to mammalian behavioral investigationsLinking multidisciplinary approaches allows for full understanding of how molecular changes in neurons and circuits underpin behavioral plasticityEdited work with chapters authored by leaders in the field around the globe OCo the broadest, most expert coverage availableComprehensive coverage synthesizes widely dispersed research, serving as one-stop shopping for comparative learning and memory researchers"

T1  - Endocrine Sex Differentiation in Fish
AN  - 2130972972
AB  - Of all vertebrates, fish exhibit unparalleled diversity of sexual plasticity and flexibility, ranging from gonochorism to unisexualism, and exceptional patterns of functional hermaphroditism. Fish farming and monosex aquaculture have led to reproductive dysfunction with males producing less milt, and females failing to ovulate and spawn. This book brings together relevant information on the role of the endocrine system on sexual differentiation in fish, and bridges the gap between molecular endocrinologists and fishery scientists.

AN  - 2133346992
AB  - An entertaining and enlightening exploration of why waste matters The Origin of Feces takes an important subject out of locker-rooms, potty-training manuals, and bio-solids management boardrooms into the fresh air of everyoneÃ¢ÂÂs lives. With insight and wit, David Waltner-Toews explores what has been too often ignored and makes a compelling argument for a deeper understanding of human and animal waste. Approaching the subject from a variety of perspectives ÃÂ evolutionary, ecological, and cultural ÃÂ The Origin of Feces shows us how integral excrement is to biodiversity, agriculture, public health, food production and distribution, and global ecosystems. From the primordial ooze to dung beetles, from bug frass, cat scats, and flush toilets to global trade, pandemics, and energy, this is the awesome, troubled, unexpurgated story of feces.

T1  - A good news story we can really gobble up
AN  - 1321590209
AB  - Manitoba's turkey population is in great shape, says Frank Baldwin, game bird manager at Manitoba Conservation and Water Stewardship. "The birds were nesting early last spring thanks to our relatively mild winter. Populations are looking good for this spring."              "That's exactly where we want to be," Baldwin said. "We know the majority of birds are harvested in this GHA (31), but that number is decreasing because birds are becoming available in other areas." Two or three new areas are established each year.              "There has never been a situation where turkeys have had a detrimental effect," he said. "They don't parasitize other species' nests and they don't push native birds out of the habitat."

T1  - Distributional Learning of Appearance
AN  - 1330881140
AB  - Opportunities for associationist learning of word meaning, where a word is heard or read contemperaneously with information being available on its meaning, are considered too infrequent to account for the rate of language acquisition in children. It has been suggested that additional learning could occur in a distributional mode, where information is gleaned from the distributional statistics (word co-occurrence etc.) of natural language. Such statistics are relevant to meaning because of the Distributional Principle that ‘words of similar meaning tend to occur in similar contexts’. Computational systems, such as Latent Semantic Analysis, have substantiated the viability of distributional learning of word meaning, by showing that semantic similarities between words can be accurately estimated from analysis of the distributional statistics of a natural language corpus. We consider whether appearance similarities can also be learnt in a distributional mode. As grounds for such a mode we advance the Appearance Hypothesis that ‘words with referents of similar appearance tend to occur in similar contexts’. We assess the viability of such learning by looking at the performance of a computer system that interpolates, on the basis of distributional and appearance similarity, from words that it has been explicitly taught the appearance of, in order to identify and name objects that it has not been taught about. Our experiment tests with a set of 660 simple concrete noun words. Appearance information on words is modelled using sets of images of examples of the word. Distributional similarity is computed from a standard natural language corpus. Our computation results support the viability of distributional learning of appearance.

T1  - Derek Walcott, the Journeyman Years, Volume 2: Performing Arts:&nbsp;Occasional Prose 1957-1974
AN  - 2141104430
AB  - During the same period in which Derek Walcott was pouring immense physical, emotional, and logistical resources into the foundation of a viable first-rate West Indian theatre company and continuing to write his inimitable poetry, he was also busy writing newspaper reviews, chiefly for the 
Trinidad Guardian. His prodigious reviewing activity extended far beyond those areas with which one might most readily associate his interests and convictions. As Gordon Rohlehr once presciently observed, "If one wants to see a quotidian workaday Walcott, one should go back to [his] well over five hundred articles, essays and reviews on painting, cinema, calypso, carnival, drama and literature," articles which "reveal a rich, various, witty and scrupulous intelligence in which generous humour counterpoints acerbity." These articles capture the vitality of Caribbean culture and shed additional light on the aesthetic preoccupations expressed in Walcott's essays published in journals. The editors have examined the corpus of Walcott's journalistic activity from its beginnings in 1950 to its peak in the early 1970s, and have made a generous selection of material from the 
Guardian, along with occasional pieces from such sources as 
Public Opinion (Kingston) and 
The Voice of St. Lucia (Castries). The articles in Volume 2 are organized as follows: the performing arts; general surveys of anglophone Caribbean drama, theatre, and society; festivals, theatre companies, and productions; British and American drama; dance and music theatre; Carnival and calypso; and cinema screenings in Trinidad. Volume 2 additionally contains an exhaustive annotated and cross-referenced chronological bibliography of Walcott's journalism up to 1990. The co-editor Christopher Balme has written a searching introductory essay on a central theme - here, a survey of West Indian theatre and Walcott's engagement with it, particularly the idea of a 'National Theatre', coupled with an illustrative discussion of the playwright's seminal dramatic spectacle 
Drums and Colours.

T1  - In situ assessment of genotoxic and mutagenic potential of polluted river water in Channa punctatus and Mystus vittatus
AN  - 2623505887
AB  - River Gomti, a tributary of river Ganga in northern India, is being polluted due to indiscriminate disposal of domestic sewage and industrial wastes that contain genotoxic chemicals. The study was conducted to evaluate the genotoxic potential of polluted water of river Gomti in two fish species, namely Channa punctatus and Mystus vittatus. The fishes were exposed in situ in nylon cages to the polluted water of river Gomti fixed near a distillery outlet located in Lucknow. The induction of DNA damage and micronuclei were determined in blood erythrocytes using comet assay and micronucleus test, respectively. The induction in micronuclei frequencies and DNA damage were found to be significantly elevated (p < 0.01) in exposed specimens after 3 days post-exposure as compared to the control, i.e. from laboratory-acclimatized fish specimens. The comparison of DNA damage between the two species indicated that C. punctatus is more sensitive to aquatic pollutants. Thus, this fish could be used as a bio-indicator of genotoxicity for bio-monitoring of water bodies. The results further revealed that the river Gomti is being contaminated with potential genotoxic and mutagenic chemicals produced from industrial and domestic activities; therefore, immediate measures are needed to reduce the inflow of pollutants in the river.

T1  - Eco-Global Crimes:&nbsp;Contemporary Problems and Future Challenges
AN  - 2130918691
AB  - Building on knowledge within the fields of green and eco-global criminology, this book uses empirical and theoretical arguments to discuss the multi-dimensional character of eco-global crime. It provides an overview of eco-global crimes and discusses them from a justice perspective. The persistence of animal abuse and speciesism are also examined together with policies aimed at controlling the natural world and plant species. Pollution by large corporations, rights of indigenous peoples and the damage caused by the mineral extraction are also considered. Providing new ideas and insights which will be relevant on a global scale, this book is an interesting and useful study of the exploitation of nature and other species. It will be invaluable for students and scholars globally, working within or connected to the field of green and eco-global criminology.

T1  - Human Dependence on Nature:&nbsp;How to Help Solve the Environmental Crisis
AN  - 2131359913
AB  - Humanity is dependent on Nature to survive, yet our society largely acts as if this is not the case. The energy that powers our very cells, the nutrients that make up our bodies, the ecosystem services that clean our water and air; these are all provided by the Nature from which we have evolved and of which we are a part. This book examines why we deny or ignore this dependence and what we can do differently to help solve the environmental crisis. Written in an accessible and engaging style, Haydn Washington provides an excellent overview of humanity's relationship with Nature. The book looks at energy flow, nutrient cycling, ecosystem services, ecosystem collapse as well as exploring our psychological and spiritual dependency on nature. It also examines anthropocentrism and denial as causes of our unwillingness to respect our inherent dependence on the natural environment. The book concludes by bringing these issues together and providing a framework for solutions to the environmental crisis.

T1  - Genetic 'bar coding' promises help against invasive plant species, local botanist says
AN  - 1112383009
AB  - "We're working on it right now. In five years, it'll be a reality," the botanical director for the University of Guelph's Biodiversity Institute of Ontario told a Delta Guelph Hotel audience on the first day of a two-day invasive plant symposium.              The Guelph scientists are developing an ever-growing "library," to which each species is slotted "to show where it fits into the tree of life."              "It's a nightmare," [Imme Gerke] said. "We need collaboration across departments, governments, academia and industry."

T1  - Motul de San José:&nbsp;Politics, History, and Economy in a Maya Polity
AN  - 2130883668
AB  - Scholars have long debated the nature of Maya political organization during the Classic period (AD 250-950). Complex questions regarding political centralization, economic change, and the role of politics and economics in the rise and collapse of the civilization have been examined and reexamined from a variety of perspectives. Antonia Foias and Kitty Emery have assembled a broad collection of essays all focused on a single polity, that of Motul de San José. 
By presenting a coherent interdisciplinary body of archaeological and environmental data, the volume offers an intensely deep, focused investigation of the various models of the ancient Maya political and economic systems. Research conducted over six seasons of fieldwork reveals a more centralized political system than expected and uncovers the workings of the ancient economic structure. The contributors offer new details concerning how involved royals and nonroyal elites were in the politics of nearby states, as well as an extensive tribute system.

T1  - In situ assessment of genotoxic and mutagenic potential of polluted river water in Channa punctatus and Mystus vittatus
AN  - 1652830959
AB  - River Gomti, a tributary of river Ganga in northern India, is being polluted due to indiscriminate disposal of domestic sewage and industrial wastes that contain genotoxic chemicals. The study was conducted to evaluate the genotoxic potential of polluted water of river Gomti in two fish species, namely Channa punctatus and Mystus vittatus. The fishes were exposed in situ in nylon cages to the polluted water of river Gomti fixed near a distillery outlet located in Lucknow. The induction of DNA damage and micronuclei were determined in blood erythrocytes using comet assay and micronucleus test, respectively. The induction in micronuclei frequencies and DNA damage were found to be significantly elevated (p<0.01) in exposed specimens after 3days post-exposure as compared to the control, i.e. from laboratory-acclimatized fish specimens. The comparison of DNA damage between the two species indicated that C. punctatus is more sensitive to aquatic pollutants. Thus, this fish could be used as a bio-indicator of genotoxicity for bio-monitoring of water bodies. The results further revealed that the river Gomti is being contaminated with potential genotoxic and mutagenic chemicals produced from industrial and domestic activities; therefore, immediate measures are needed to reduce the inflow of pollutants in the river.

T1  - First Report of a Toxic Nodularia spumigena (Nostocales/ Cyanobacteria) Bloom in Sub-Tropical Australia. II. Bioaccumulation of Nodularin in Isolated Populations of Mullet (Mugilidae)
AN  - 1032674437; 22851952
AB  - Fish collected after a mass mortality at an artificial lake in south-east Queensland, Australia, were examined for the presence of nodularin as the lake had earlier been affected by a Nodularia bloom. Methanol extracts of muscle, liver, peritoneal and stomach contents were analysed by HPLC and tandem mass spectrometry; histological examination was conducted on livers from captured mullet. Livers of sea mullet (Mugil cephalus) involved in the fish kill contained high concentrations of nodularin (median 43.6 mg/kg, range 40.8-47.8 mg/kg dry weight; n = 3) and the toxin was also present in muscle tissue (median 44.0 µg/kg, range 32.3-56.8 µg/kg dry weight). Livers of fish occupying higher trophic levels accumulated much lower concentrations. Mullet captured from the lake 10 months later were also found to have high hepatic nodularin levels. DNA sequencing of mullet specimens revealed two species inhabiting the study lake: M. cephalus and an unidentified mugilid. The two mullet species appear to differ in their exposure and/or uptake of nodularin, with M. cephalus demonstrating higher tissue concentrations. The feeding ecology of mullet would appear to explain the unusual capacity of these fish to concentrate nodularin in their livers; these findings may have public health implications for mullet fisheries and aquaculture production where toxic cyanobacteria blooms affect source waters. This report incorporates a systematic review of the literature on nodularin measured in edible fish, shellfish and crustaceans. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Fishing for solutions on Scugog walleye decline
AN  - 1022160790
AB  - In the end, no one wants to see walleye disappear from Lake Scugog. Through official and informal conservation measures, keen oversight and habitat promotion and management, one of Port Perry's traditionally favourite fish stocks among anglers will endure. If we collectively succeed, we'll no longer have to pity the poor walleye in Lake Scugog.

T1  - Parasitology:&nbsp;An Integrated Approach
AN  - 2131440301
AB  - Parasitology
 An Integrated Approach 

Parasitology is a concise, student-friendly account of parasites and parasitic relationships with a strong emphasis throughout on parasite interactions with other pathogens. In addition, it looks at how host behaviour contributes to the spread and control of infections. 
The effects of parasitic infections are influenced by a range of host factors such as genetic constitution, immune status, and behaviour and this text takes an integrated approach to provide a full understanding of a wide range of topics from molecular biology and immunology to social, religious and cultural factors. Emphasis is also given to diagnostic techniques, from light microscopy to advanced molecular biology, and to treatment and control - highlighting recent advances in medicine, genomics and economics. 
 

A concise, clearly-written integrated introduction to the study of parasites. 

Clearly set out with section of full colour illustrations. 

An emphasis on recent research throughout. 

Companion website with additional illustrations, questions and project work.  
Students of biology, zoology, agriculture, animal welfare, biomedical sciences, medicine and veterinary sciencewill appreciate this clear and accessible introduction.

T1  - Ozone in Food Processing
AN  - 2131266423
AB  - The food industry is constantly challenged to provide healthy, minimally processed products that have an extended shelf life and are safe to eat. In response to consumer demands for 'greener' food additives, industry interest in ozone has increased in recent years. Excess ozone rapidly autodecomposes to produce oxygen and thus it leaves no residues in food. Ozone is increasingly accepted as an environmentally friendly technology. Ozone was affirmed to be Generally Recognised As Safe (GRAS) in contact with foodstuffs by a panel of food experts convened by the Electric Power Research Institute in 1996 and was subsequently approved as an Antimicrobial Agent in direct contact with foods of all types by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2001. 
In 
Ozone in Food Processing, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of ozone processing in the food industry, examining its applications across various food groups, including evaluations of the impacts on product quality and safety. The authors also address global regulatory and legislative requirements for ozone processing, and provide recommendations and opportunities for various health and safety-related issues, suggesting new applications for ozone processing in the food industry. 

Ozone in Food Processing is the first book to comprehensively review the theory and application of ozone in food processing, providing an insight into the current state-of-the-art applications as well as reviewing established and emerging applications in food processing, preservation and waste management. This book will be of interest to food scientists, engineers and microbiologists working in food processing, as well as academic researchers and lecturers in the subject area.The food industry is constantly challenged to provide healthy, minimally processed products that have an extended shelf life and are safe to eat.

T1  - Evolution in a Toxic World:&nbsp;How Life Responds to Chemical Threats
AN  - 2131204476
AB  - With BPA in baby bottles, mercury in fish, and lead in computer monitors, the world has become a toxic place. But as Emily Monosson demonstrates in her groundbreaking new book, it has always been toxic. When oxygen first developed in Earth's atmosphere, it threatened the very existence of life: now we literally can't live without it. According to Monosson, examining how life adapted to such early threats can teach us a great deal about today's (and tomorrow's) most dangerous contaminants. While the study of evolution has advanced many other sciences, from conservation biology to medicine, the field of toxicology has yet to embrace this critical approach.
 
 In 
Evolution in a Toxic World, Monosson seeks to change that. She traces the development of life's defense systems--the mechanisms that transform, excrete, and stow away potentially harmful chemicals--from more than three billion years ago to today. Beginning with our earliest ancestors' response to ultraviolet radiation, Monosson explores the evolution of chemical defenses such as antioxidants, metal binding proteins, detoxification, and cell death.
 
 As we alter the world's chemistry, these defenses often become overwhelmed faster than our bodies can adapt. But studying how our complex internal defense network currently operates, and how it came to be that way, may allow us to predict how it will react to novel and existing chemicals. This understanding could lead to not only better management and preventative measures, but possibly treatment of current diseases. Development of that knowledge starts with this pioneering book.
One of the first books, if not the first book, on toxic evolution 
Timeliness of topic, in terms of scientific research, policy debates, and news coverage 
Presents a groundbreaking approach to a growing field 
Accessibly presented but high value information
 
Emily Monosson is an environmental toxicologist, writer, and consultant. She is an adjunct professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, author of 
Unnatural Selection: How We Are Changing Life, Gene by Gene, and the editor of 
Motherhood, the Elephant in the Laboratory: Women Scientists Speak Out.

T1  - Animal Evolution:&nbsp;Interrelationships of the Living Phyla
AN  - 2132100520
AB  - Animal Evolution provides a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary interrelationships and myriad diversity of the Animal Kingdom. It reviews the classical, morphological information from structure and embryology, as well as the new data gained from studies using immune stainings of nerves and muscles and blastomere markings which makes it possible to follow the fate of single blastomeres all the way to early organogenesis. Until recently, the informationfrom analyses of gene sequences has tended to produce myriads of quite diverging trees. However, the latest generation of molecular methods, using many genes, expressed sequence tags, and even whole genomes, has brought a new stability to the field. For the first time this book brings together theinformation from these varied fields, and demonstrates that it is indeed now possible to build a phylogenetic tree from a combination of both morphology and gene sequences.This thoroughly revised third edition of Animal Evolution brings the subject fully up to date, especially in light of the latest advances in molecular techniques. The book is generously illustrated throughout with finely detailed line drawings and clear diagrams, many of them new.

T1  - Twenty-First Century Ecosystems:&nbsp;Managing the Living World Two Centuries after Darwin: Report of a Symposium
AN  - 2131909117
AB  - The two hundredth anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin, February 12, 2009, occurred at a critical time for the United States and the world. In honor of Darwin's birthday, the National Research Council appointed a committee under the auspices of the U.S. National Committee (USNC) for DIVERSITAS to plan a Symposium on Twenty-first Century Ecosystems. The purpose of the symposium was to capture some of the current excitement and recent progress in scientific understanding of ecosystems, from the microbial to the global level, while also highlighting how improved understanding can be applied to important policy issues that have broad biodiversity and ecosystem effects. The aim was to help inform new policy approaches that could satisfy human needs while also maintaining the integrity of the goods and services provided by biodiversity and ecosystems over both the short and the long terms. 
This report summarizes the views expressed by symposium participants; however, it does not provide a session-by-session summary of the presentations at the symposium. Instead, the symposium steering committee identified eight key themes that emerged from the lectures, which were addressed in different contexts by different speakers. The focus here is on general principles rather than specifics. These eight themes provide a sharp focus on a few concepts that enable scientists, environmental NGOs, and policy makers to engage more effectively around issues of central importance for biodiversity and ecosystem management.

T1  - Biochemical and Biological Effects of Organotins
AN  - 2131961171
AB  - Organotins are widespread contaminants especially of water environments. Their chemically versatile structure makes organotin compounds able to bind to a variety of biomolecules thus widely affecting biological functions. Trisubstituted molecules, namely tributyltin (TBT) and triphenyltin (TPhT), have been widely employed in antifouling paints and are also exploited as plastic stabilizers that unfortunately cause harmful biological effects. Persistent bioaccumulation has resulted in organotins becoming a significant environmental threat. Chapter by chapter, the biological and biochemical effects of organotins are unravelled in this e-book by a careful analysis of the most recent findings with special focus on contaminant action mechanisms at cellular and molecular level. The e-book provides an intriguing insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in organotin toxicology thus serving as a useful reference to biochemists, biologists, ecotoxicologists and life science students.

AB  - This paper examines the large and strange domain of spam and the role of spamming in the development of virtual communities and Internet governance. It contends that spamming operates by exploiting the tension between communities and the technological infrastructure that underlies them, and that these exploits illuminate both the complex relationship between virtual communities and the governments within which they operate and the changing politics of attention online.

T1  - Atlas of Inherited Metabolic Diseases 3E
AN  - 2136238892
AB  - In a field where even experts may find that years have elapsed since they last encountered a child with a given disorder, it is essential for the clinician to have a comprehensive source of practical and highly illustrated information covering the whole spectrum of metabolic disease to refer to. The third edition of this highly regarded book, authored by three of the foremost authorities in pediatric metabolic medicine, fulfils this need by providing an invaluable insight into the problems associated with metabolic diseases. The Atlas of Metabolic Disease is divided into sections of related disorders, such as disorders of amino acid metabolism, lipid storage disorders and mitochondrial diseases, with an introductory outline where appropriate summarizing the biochemical features and general management issues. Within sections each chapter deals with an individual disease, starting with a useful summary of major phenotypic expression and including clear and helpful biochemical pathways, identifying for the reader exactly where the defect is occurring. Throughout the book, plentiful photographs, often showing extremely rare disorders, are an invaluable aid to diagnosis.

T1  - A Molecular Phylogeny of Bivalve Mollusks: Ancient Radiations and Divergences as Revealed by Mitochondrial Genes
AN  - 1310772653
AB  - Background 
Bivalves are very ancient and successful conchiferan mollusks (both in terms of species number and geographical distribution). Despite their importance in marine biota, their deep phylogenetic relationships were scarcely investigated from a molecular perspective, whereas much valuable work has been done on taxonomy, as well as phylogeny, of lower taxa.
 Methodology/Principal Findings 
Here we present a class-level bivalve phylogeny with a broad sample of 122 ingroup taxa, using four mitochondrial markers (MT-RNR1, MT-RNR2, MT-CO1, MT-CYB). Rigorous techniques have been exploited to set up the dataset, analyze phylogenetic signal, and infer a single final tree. In this study, we show the basal position of Opponobranchia to all Autobranchia, as well as of Palaeoheterodonta to the remaining Autobranchia, which we here propose to call Amarsipobranchia. Anomalodesmata were retrieved as monophyletic and basal to (Heterodonta + Pteriomorphia).
 Conclusions/Significance 
Bivalve morphological characters were traced onto the phylogenetic trees obtained from the molecular analysis; our analysis suggests that eulamellibranch gills and heterodont hinge are ancestral characters for all Autobranchia. This conclusion would entail a re-evaluation of bivalve symplesiomorphies.

AN  - 2131924335
AB  - Have we already entered a new epoch, the Anthropocene, dominated by the impact of human activities? What of the effects of increasing globalisation on the seas? Thirty-three experts on marine affairs and the law of the sea examine the emerging challenges for the World Ocean, inquiring into developments prompted by globalisation in central issue-areas of the law of the sea. These are explored systematically in sections on the key challenges and developments in the interface of science, economic uses and law (Part I); climate change and the oceans (Part II); sustainability of fisheries (Part III); challenges and responses related to global maritime transport (Part IV); and the regulatory responses to global challenges in seas surrounding Europe (Part V).

T1  - Loving Animals:&nbsp;Toward a New Animal Advocacy
AN  - 2131040213
AB  - The contemporary animal rights movement encompasses a wide range of sometimes-competing agendas from vegetarianism to animal liberation. For people for whom pets are family members--animal lovers outside the fray--extremist positions in which all human-animal interaction is suspect often discourage involvement in the movement to end cruelty to other beings. In Loving Animals, Kathy Rudy argues that in order to achieve such goals as ending animal testing and factory farming, activists need to be better attuned to the profound emotional, even spiritual, attachment that many people have with the animals in their lives. Offering an alternative to both the acceptance of animal exploitation and radical animal liberation, Rudy shows that a deeper understanding of the nature of our feelings for and about animals can redefine the human-animal relationship in a positive way. Through extended interviews with people whose lives are intertwined with animals, analysis of the cultural representation of animals, and engaging personal accounts, she explores five realms in which humans use animals: as pets, for food, in entertainment, in scientific research, and for clothing. In each case she presents new methods of animal advocacy to reach a more balanced and sustainable relationship association built on reciprocity and connection. Using this intense emotional bond as her foundation, Rudy suggests that the nearly universal stories we tell of living with and loving animals will both broaden the support for animal advocacy and inspire the societal changes that will improve the lives of animals--and humans--everywhere.

T1  - Sustainability Management:&nbsp;Lessons from and for New York City, America, and the Planet
AN  - 2131075971
AB  - Can we grow our world economy and create opportunities for the poor while keeping the planet intact? Can we maintain our vibrant, dynamic lifestyles while ensuring the Earth stays productive and viable? Aimed at managers, students, scholars, and policymakers, Sustainability Management answers these questions in the affirmative, arguing it is possible for environmentally sustainable business practices and policies to foster economic and long-term growth. Written by a former analyst and consultant with the EPA, this book originally combines sustainable efforts in water, agriculture, urban, and power management to achieve—in practice, not just in theory—a sustainable planet and economy. Steven Cohen begins with the technical, financial, managerial, and political challenges of such a project, and then honestly assesses sustainable practices in the manufacturing and service industries. He addresses renewable and carbon-free energy production; water sustainability, especially with regard to energy issues involving filtration, distribution, and changing rainfall patterns; food cultivation and distribution; and ways to maintain the interdependent systems on which we depend to live. Taking examples from New York City, one of the most sustainable and sustainability-minded metropolises in the world, Cohen explains how everything from construction to waste management can be designed to facilitate a sustainable environment, not just for New York but also for the world. He concludes with this macroscopic view, outlining the global efforts necessary to preserve biodiversity and ecosystems, and the impact of war, terrorism, and human conflict on sustainability.

T1  - Province conducts lake checkup
AN  - 876071644
AB  - "They have been followed by a number of communities in Manitoba for quite a while," [Christine Melnick] said. "There shouldn't be any big surprises for any communities."              "We have to be much more aggressive," Melnick said. "We know that we can't afford to cut corners. We know we have to go the full distance to save Lake Winnipeg. And it's not just Lake Winnipeg; it's the adjoining waters as well."              Another theory revolves around the timing of the invasion of rainbow smelt to the lake in the early 1990s coinciding with increases in pickerel production. Rainbow smelt are small fish that graze on tiny organisms. It's unknown to what extent rainbow smelt has affected pickerel production in the lake and whether rainbow smelt comprises a significant part of the pickerel diet, particularly in the lake's north basin.

"Your fish warnings are more ominous in Lake Ontario," says Ontario's Environmental Commissioner, Gord Miller. "If you look at the guidelines for eating fish, you'll find that the highest level of contaminants is in Lake Ontario."              Mattson says the lake is "a primary need." "Drinking water - like food, like shelter, like clothes" says Mattson. "This is really fundamental to where we live and why we live here. It's really important for people to understand what a privilege it is and what protections are needed to maintain that advantage."

T1  - Don't leave waterways up the creek
AN  - 865221439
AB  - Others rely on public transit or walk every day. Yet I've found another way to get around the city that's free, avoids traffic and offers a different perspective on our urban landscape. I've been travelling Toronto by canoe.              While canoeing down the Don, we met up with two other Torontonians paddling beside us. Matt Galloway, host of CBC's Metro Morning and Gord MacPherson, who's been working with the TRCA for 28 years.              I hope the mayor accepts my canoeing invitation. If he does, he'll see why we mustn't leave Toronto's natural environment up the creek without a paddle.

T1  - Ant Colonies: Behavior in Insects and Computer Applications:&nbsp;Behavior in Insects and Computer Applications
AN  - 2131917014
AB  - Ant colony optimization is a population-based general-search technique that can be used for the solution of difficult combinatorial problems. Ant colony optimization uses the knowledge-reinforcing mechanism used by real-life ants while traversing possible paths in search of food, depositing a chemical substance (called pheromone), en-route and subsequently forming trails which can then be followed by other ants in the colony. With its strong mathematical foundation and its simplicity of use, ant colony optimization provides an alternative method to routing optimizations with a wide range of applications. This book presents topical research in the study of ant colonies, their behavior and application in computer technologies.

AN  - 2131287067
AB  - The classic text in wastewater microbiology, updated for a changing field 
The field of water and wastewater microbiology has advanced dramatically in recent years, spurred by growing awareness about health and environmental impacts. These advances have been thoroughly integrated into the Fourth Edition of 
Wastewater Microbiology, widely regarded as the field's definitive text reference. In this 
Fourth Edition, the book focuses more exclusively on issues particular to wastewater--microbial contaminants found in wastewater, methods of detection for these contaminants, methods of cleansing wastewater of microbial contamination, and the health effects of microbial contamination--with new information on fecal contamination and new molecular methods. 
The many advances in wastewater microbiology have all been thoroughly integrated into this text, including: 
 
 
A new chapter on microbial source tracking of fecal contamination of receiving waters  
 
Recent information on disinfection methods such as UV disinfection and photoreactivation, solar radiation, photocatalysis, ultrasonic energy, ultra-high hydrostatic pressure, membrane filtration, and the use of nanomaterials  
 
New methods for determining cell viability/activity in environmental samples  
 
An expanded section on molecular methods  
 
A new section on bacterial spores as indicators  
 
Advances in the study of the activated sludge system as well as an expanded section on Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) in activated sludge  
 
A new section on bioelectrochemical wastewater treatment, which is based on the use of microorganisms for the production of bioelectricity   
In addition, the text includes updated content on risk assessment, methanogen classification, and methodology and inhibition of anaerobic digestion. Information concerning the growing fields of epidemiology and public health microbiology has been similarly expanded. 
Complete with end-of-chapter questions, this is the single go-to reference in wastewater microbiology for advanced undergraduates, graduate students, and professionals in sciences and engineering in the fields of microbiology and environmental/wastewater engineering and treatment, as well as for public health officials.

T1  - Detection of Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia Virus (VHSV) from Diporeia spp. (Pontoporeiidae, Amphipoda) in the Laurentian Great Lakes, USA
AN  - 902449220; 21210995
AB  - Abstract: The mode of viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) transmission in the Great Lakes basin is largely unknown. In order to assess the potential role of macroinvertebrates in VHSV transmission, Diporeia  spp., a group of amphipods that are preyed upon by a number of susceptible Great Lakes fishes, were collected from seven locations in four of the Great Lakes and analyzed for the presence of VHSV. It was demonstrated that VHSV is present in some Diporeia  spp. samples collected from lakes Ontario, Huron, and Michigan, but not from Lake Superior. Phylogenetic comparison of partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences (737 base pairs) of the five isolates to sequences of 13 other VHSV strains showed the clustering of Diporeia  spp. isolates with the VHSV genotype IVb. This study reports the first incidence of a fish-pathogenic rhabdovirus being isolated from Diporeia , or any other crustacean and underscores the role macroinvertebrates may play in VHSV ecology.

T1  - Anthropological Approaches to Zooarchaeology:&nbsp;Colonialism, Complexity and Animal Transformations
AN  - 2132085716
AB  - Animals in complex human societies are often both meal and symbol, related to everyday practice and ritual. People in such societies may be characterized as having unequal access to such resources, or else the meaning of animals may differ for component groups. Here, in this book, 28 peer-reviewed papers that span 4 continents and the Caribbean islands explore in different ways how animals were incorporated into the diets and religions of many unique societies. The temporal range is from the Neolithic to the Spanish colonization of the New World as well as to modern tourist trade in indigenous animal art. The volume explores various themes including the interaction of foodways with complex societies, the interaction between diet and colonialism and the complex role that animals, and parts of animals, play in all human societies as religious, identity markers, or other types of symbols. Organized according to these themes, rather than geographic location or time period, the papers presented here crosscut such divisions. In so doing, this book presents an opportunity for scholars divided by geography especially, but also by temporal period, to explore each other's research and demonstrate that different archaeological settings can address the same problems cross-culturally.

T1  - Prime Movers of Globalization:&nbsp;The History and Impact of Diesel Engines and Gas Turbines
AN  - 2131154656
AB  - The story of how diesel engines and gas turbines, used to power cargo ships and jet airplanes, made today's globally integrated economy possible. 
The many books on globalization published over the past few years range from claims that the world is flat to an unlikely rehabilitation of Genghis Khan as a pioneer of global commerce. Missing from these accounts is a consideration of the technologies behind the creation of the globalized economy. What makes it possible for us to move billions of tons of raw materials and manufactured goods from continent to continent? Why are we able to fly almost anywhere on the planet within twenty-four hours? In 
Prime Movers of Globalization, Vaclav Smil offers a history of two key technical developments that have driven globalization: the high-compression non-sparking internal combustion engines invented by Rudolf Diesel in the 1890s and the gas turbines designed by Frank Whittle and Hans-Joachim Pabst von Ohain in the 1930s. The massive diesel engines that power cargo ships and the gas turbines that propel jet engines, Smil argues, are more important to the global economy than any corporate structure or international trade agreement. Smil compares the efficiency and scale of these two technologies to prime movers of the past, including the sail and the steam engine. The lengthy processes of development, commercialization, and diffusion that the diesel engine and the gas turbine went through, he argues, provide perfect examples of gradual technical advances that receive little attention but have resulted in epochal shifts in global affairs and the global economy.

T1  - AIA Guide to New York City
AN  - 2257935104
AB  - Hailed as "extraordinarily learned" (New York Times), "blithe in spirit and unerring in vision," (New York Magazine), and the "definitive record of New York's architectural heritage" (Municipal Art Society), Norval White and Elliot Willensky's book is an essential reference for everyone with an interest in architecture and those who simply want to know more about New York City.First published in 1968, the AIA Guide to New York City has long been the definitive guide to the city's architecture. Moving through all five boroughs, neighborhood by neighborhood, it offers the most complete overview of New York's significant places, past and present. The Fifth Edition continues to include places of historical importance--including extensive coverage of the World Trade Center site--while also taking full account of the construction boom of the past 10 years, a boom that has given rise to an unprecedented number of new buildings by such architects as Frank Gehry, Norman Foster, and Renzo Piano. All of the buildings included in the Fourth Edition have been revisited and re-photographed and much of the commentary has been re-written, and coverage of the outer boroughs--particularly Brooklyn--has been expanded.Famed skyscrapers and historic landmarks are detailed, but so, too, are firehouses, parks, churches, parking garages, monuments, and bridges. Boasting more than 3000 new photographs, 100 enhanced maps, and thousands of short and spirited entries, the guide is arranged geographically by borough, with each borough divided into sectors and then into neighborhood. Extensive commentaries describe the character of the divisions.Knowledgeable, playful, and beautifully illustrated, here is the ultimate guided tour of New York's architectural treasures.Acclaim for earlier editions of the AIA Guide to New York City:"An extraordinarily learned, personable exegesis of our metropolis. No other American or, for that matter, world city can boast so definitive a one-volume guide to its built environment."-- Philip Lopate, New York Times"Blithe in spirit and unerring in vision."-- New York Magazine"A definitive record of New York's architectural heritage... witty and helpful pocketful which serves as arbiter of architects, Baedeker for boulevardiers, catalog for the curious, primer for preservationists, and sourcebook to students. For all who seek to know of New York, it is here. No home should be without a copy."-- Municipal Art Society"There are two reasons the guide has entered the pantheon of New York books. One is its encyclopedic nature, and the other is its inimitable style--'smart, vivid, funny and opinionated' as the architectural historian Christopher Gray once summed it up in pithy W & W fashion."-- Constance Rosenblum, New York Times"A book for architectural gourmands and gastronomic gourmets."-- The Village Voice

As well as the inclusion of a new chapter covering the emerging fields of genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, this exciting new edition provides much new and enhanced information on all major areas of importance in this field, including the following: conservation genetics, forensic applications, identification of animals to family level, genome mapping, disease identification, the use of triploidy in reducing the genetic impact of escapees, and the use of GMOs in the industry.
 
With so much new information included, the addition of a further well known and respected co-author and many new better quality illustrations, this second edition of Biotechnology and Genetics in Fisheries and Aquaculture will be of great use as a reference to upper level students studying fisheries, aquaculture, genetics, biotechnology, aquatic and biological sciences. Personnel working in the fish farming and fisheries industries management and research sectors will find much of use and commercial interest in this important book. All libraries in universities and research establishments where biological sciences, aquaculture and fisheries are studied and taught should have copies of this excellent new edition on their shelves.Andy Beaumont is based at the School of Ocean Sciences, Unioversity of Bangor, Menai, Wales, UK

T1  - Teaching for Student Learning:&nbsp;Becoming an Accomplished Teacher
AN  - 2131429580
AB  - Teaching for Student Learning: Becoming an Accomplished Teacher shows teachers how to move from novice to expert status by integrating both research and the wisdom of practice into their teaching. It emphasizes how accomplished teachers gradually acquire and apply a broad repertoire of evidence-based teaching practices in the support of student learning. The book's content stems from three major fields of study: 1) theories and research on how people learn, including new insights from the cognitive and neurosciences; 2) research on classroom practices shown to have the greatest effect on student learning; and 3) research on effective schooling, defined as school-level factors that enhance student achievement and success. Although the book's major focus is on teaching, it devotes considerable space to describing how students learn and how the most effective and widely-used models of teaching connect to principles of student learning. Specifically, it describes how research on teaching, cognition, and neuroscience converge to provide an evidence-based "science of learning" which teachers can use to advance their practice. Key features include the following: Evidence-Based Practice - This theme is developed through: 1) an ongoing review and synthesis of research on teaching and learning and the resulting guidelines for practice and 2) boxed research summaries within the chapters. Instructional Repertoire Theme - Throughout the book teaching is viewed as an extremely complex activity that requires a repertoire of instructional strategies that, once mastered, can be drawn upon to fit specific classrooms and teaching situations. Standards-based School Environments - Education today is dominated by standards-based school environments. Unlike competing books, this one describes these environments and shows how they impact curriculum design and learning activities. The objective is to show how teachers can make standards-based education work for them. Pedagogical Features - In addition to an end-of-book glossary, each chapter contains research boxes, reflection boxes, itemized end-of-chapter summaries, and end-of-chapter learning activities. Website - An accompanying website contains a variety of field-oriented and site-based activities that teachers can do alone or with colleagues.

T1  - Meteorological and water quality changes in Lake Trasimeno (Umbria, Italy) during the last fifty years
AN  - 2417749114
AB  - This paper illustrates the results of an analysis performed on historical data of the main meteorological and water quality variables collected during the last fifty years in the basin of Lake Trasimeno, a shallow lake subjected to important water level fluctuations. The results reveal a significant increase of the annual mean of minimum and maximum air temperature, water temperature and solar radiation, and a significant reduction of precipitation and cloud cover, which have mostly occurred during the last twenty years. The decadal rate of warming observed in the last twenty years for air temperature (0.33 °C decade-1) is consistent with the estimate reported by the IPCC for the land-surface temperature in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the surface water temperature in Lake Trasimeno shows a more marked increase (0.65 °C decade-1), comparable to that observed in other lakes of Mediterranean areas. On a monthly scale, the most significant variations are observed in late-spring and early summer months for temperature and solar irradiation, and in winter and spring months for rainfall, which result in an appreciable modification of the seasonal progression. The alterations of the thermal and hydrological balance of the lake have caused a progressive lowering of the water level and the emergence of evaporative conditions. As a consequence of the drought, a progressive accumulation of dissolved salts (3.5 106 kg y-1) is observed, which is partially explained by meteoric loading. The analysis also shows that an increase in the total alkalinity has occurred during the main drought phases of the last forty years, which has been shown to be consistent with what expected on the basis of the changes in the ionic composition of the waters. With decreasing water levels, a strong reduction in water transparency has also been observed, which does not appear to be connected with a change in the trophic state of the lake, but rather with the increase of suspended solids from bottom sediments, in agreement with the predictions based on resuspension models in shallow waters. On putting the results into the future scenario of climate change, an accelerating drought and progressive worsening of the water quality can be predicted for Lake Trasimeno in the near future.

T1  - Virology:&nbsp;Molecular Biology and Pathogenesis
AN  - 2131948022
AB  - Based on the author’s experiences teaching virology for more than 35 years, Virology: Molecular Biology and Pathogenesis enables readers to develop a deep understanding of fundamental virology by emphasizing principles and discussing viruses in the context of virus families. Moreover, individual virus families are examined within the context of the Baltimore classification system, a key unifying theme that allows readers to assume basic facts about the replication strategy of a virus based on the nature of its genome. The first chapter provides an historical overview, followed by a chapter introducing the principles of animal virus classification and the Baltimore classification system. The next chapter explores the various modes of virus infection and disease. Chapter 4 then considers host defenses against microorganisms and viral countermeasures to subvert those host defenses.Armed with a solid foundation in basic principles, readers move on to eighteen subsequent chapters, each one dedicated to a particular virus family. These chapters detail the organization of the viral genome and its pattern of expression, with additional discussions covering viral structure, entry, assembly, release, and associated medical issues.The flow of chapters in Virology constitutes a continuous narrative in which key principles are regularly reintroduced to show how they apply in different contexts. This emphasis on principles coupled with the text’s clear, straightforward writing style enables upper-level undergraduate and graduate students as well as professionals to grasp core principles of virology with ease.Key Features· Organization by virus family within the context of the Baltimore classification system provides a strategic framework for mastering the principles of virology· Provides a uniform organization and logical flow of chapters as well as a consistent, accessible writing style· Highlight boxes review fundamental molecular and cellular biology, introduce pioneers in the field of virology, and address serious public policy issues· Key unanswered and thought-provoking scientific questions encourage critical thinking· Examples show how virology has played a role in crucial public policy decisions

T1  - Algae raise a stink at lakefront
AN  - 362383725
AB  - "I am sure most of you may have ventured down to the lakeshore at some point and perhaps saw (algae along the shore)," said Dr. Lawrence Moore, coordinator of Ontario Water Works Research Consortium. "The problem of course is when the algae grows along the shore it detaches, washes up on the shore and causes a significant decline in the use of the shore."  

              
The province managed to curb algae growth by cutting down on phosphorus in detergents and reducing phosphorus at wastewater treatment plants.  

              
"In the late 1990s algae growth did start to increase and we now, of course, truly have problem conditions again," Moore said.

T1  - Ecotoxicology Modeling
AN  - 2136049221
AB  - Both by definition and by scope, ecotoxicology is an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary science combining the disciplines of chemistry, biochemistry, toxicology, and ecology. Modeling is also increasingly used by ecotoxicologists to better understand the effects and fate of chemicals in the different compartments of the biosphere and to simulate them in the frame of predictive hazard and risk assessment schemes. 
Ecotoxicology Modeling is a comprehensive and well-documented text providing a collection of computational methods to the ecotoxicologists primarily interested in the study of the adverse effects of chemicals, their mechanisms of action and/or their environmental fate and behavior. Avoiding mathematical jargon, the book presents numerous case studies to enable the reader to understand the interest but also the limitations of linear and nonlinear models in ecotoxicology. 
Written by an international team of scientists, Ecotoxicology Modeling is of primary interest to those whose research or professional activity is directly concerned with the development and application of models in ecotoxicology. It is also intended to provide the graduate and post-graduate students with a clear and accessible text covering the main types of modeling approaches used in environmental sciences.

T1  - 2030 The Coming Tumult:&nbsp;Unlimited Growth on a Finite Planet
AN  - 2131023262
AB  - This book explores the role of corporations in creating a debate where no debate exists, the averse effects of religion on the climate debate, the professional and academic global warming deniers and their funding, why scientists are woefully incapable of competing with corporations in a public relations and legislative war, why the American middle class is disappearing, why a select group of wealthy citizens and global elites will survive and even prosper during economic collapse through privatization and exploitation of natural disasters, and why globalization will exacerbate planetary decline, and create poverty for at least 80 percent of Americans (and those in developing countries). <br /<br /The book will also explore how globalization will accelerate terrorism, how unprecedented migration will cause cultural tensions and conflict, delve into American consumption patterns and why an indebted society will keep spending money it doesn't have, and look the human compulsions driving this behavior. Neither the Democrats nor Republicans in Washington can survive without large amounts of corporate largesse because of the staggering amount of funding involved in running for and remaining in office.<br /<br /Windows of opportunity are closing rapidly and, unfortunately, are likely to slam shut before we muster the necessary national or global political will. The recent American and global economic meltdown, while serious, pales in comparison to the catastrophic dangers if climate change is allowed to spin out of control. The increasingly desperate scientific reports will almost certainly be ignored or played down ? and scientists are woefully outgunned in the sphere of public relations. <br /<br /The book begins with views of respected scientists discussing their fields of expertise, the demographic and cultural situation in Western Europe, the climate change deniers, religious myths competing with scientific truth, corporate influence on American politicians, the precarious situation faced by American-style capitalism and its effects on the middle class and the poor, and the expenditures and sacrifices which will be demanded of the American public which will not be heeded until the tipping point is long past. <br /<br /

T1  - Maritime Law: Issues, Challenges and Implications:&nbsp;Issues, Challenges and Implications
AN  - 2130958233
AB  - Maritime law is a distinct body of law which governs maritime questions and offenses. It is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities, and private international law governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans. It deals with matters including marine commerce, marine navigation, shipping, sailors, and the transportation of passengers and goods by sea. Maritime law also covers many commercial activities, although land based or occurring wholly on land, that are maritime in character. This book explores such topics as the United States Coast Guard Administrative Law Judge program which is designed to promote safety at sea while protecting mariner's rights; international approaches to Underwater Cultural Heritage protection; cruise vessel safety and security and others.

T1  - On the Origin of Species:&nbsp;By Means of Natural Selection, 6th Edition
AN  - 2131772466
AB  - Darwin consolidated a lifetime of work in On the Origin of Species, compiling his discoveries from the voyage of the Beagle, his experiments, research and correspondence. He argues for the transmutation of species over time by the process of natural selection. His work laid the foundation of evolutionary biology, though when it was published it caused tremendous religious and philosophical debates. Darwin's work is still seen by many people to oppose Christian beliefs.

T1  - The Aral Sea Encyclopedia
AN  - 2131197383
AB  - The situation of the Aral Sea is known as one of the worst man-made environmental crises of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Many have seen the satellite photos evidencing the startling shrinkage and deterioration of the sea, as it was a few decades ago and how it appears today. Whereas the Aral Sea was the world's fourth-largest inland body of water in 1960, it has now shrunk to a small fraction of that within three increasingly saline and polluted parts, primarily due to the diversion of waters for agricultural irrigation. The Aral Sea Encyclopedia is devoted to the remarkable phenomenon of the possibility of Aral Sea's imminent disappearance from the Earth in the time span of a single human generation. 
It first describes the sea before it started drying-out, and then the actions and efforts of the Central Asian countries, as well as the international community, to mitigate the socioeconomic and environmental hazards caused by this desiccation and increasing salinity. This comprehensive reference not only addresses the key environmental issues and presents national and international programs. It also documents the history of the related research studies, the involvement of prominent historical figures, and the chronology of events over three centuries, which became the milestones in the economic development of the Aral Sea and its subsequent diminution. 
The publication of the Aral Sea Encyclopedia initiates a group of similar valuable references that gather multi-disciplinary perspectives on the world's seas, including planned volumes on the Caspian and Black Seas and the Sea of Japan.First volume of Springer Series on encyclopaedias of the seas Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras

T1  - Fishing for Buffalo:&nbsp;A Guide to the Pursuit and Cuisine of Carp, Suckers, Eelpout, Gar, and Other Rough Fish
AN  - 2130950851
AB  - Is a carpsucker a carp or a sucker? Where can you find the largest eelpout in the United States? Can you catch creek chubs and fry them for supper?These questions and more are answered within the pages of Fishing for Buffalo. Rob Buffler and Tom Dickson dispel myths and rumors about rough fish with credible biological information while also demonstrating the joy of angling for nontraditional fish. The wealth of information within qualifies this book as a fishing bible for the growing number of rough fishing enthusiasts in the United States and makes it easy to identify the rough fish you may catch. It even includes a sampling of Dickson and Bufflers favorite recipes, such as Burbot Boulangère and Deviled Grilled Cisco.Rough fish may be a lot of thingsugly, unruly, or elusivebut they are definitely not boring.

T1  - Sustaining Life:&nbsp;How Human Health Depends on Biodiversity
AN  - 2131766351
AB  - The Earth's biodiversity-the rich variety of life on our planet-is disappearing at an alarming rate. And while many books have focused on the expected ecological consequences, or on the aesthetic, ethical, sociological, or economic dimensions of this loss, Sustaining Life is the first book to examine the full range of potential threats that diminishing biodiversity poses to human health. Edited and written by Harvard Medical School physicians Eric Chivian and Aaron Bernstein, along with more than 100 leading scientists who contributed to writing and reviewing the book, Sustaining Life presents a comprehensive--and sobering--view of how human medicines, biomedical research, the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, and the production of food, both on land and in the oceans, depend on biodiversity. The book's ten chapters cover everything from what biodiversity is and how human activity threatens it to how we as individuals can help conserve the world's richly varied biota. Seven groups of organisms, some of the most endangered on Earth, provide detailed case studies to illustrate the contributions they have already made to human medicine, and those they are expected to make if we do not drive them to extinction. Drawing on the latest research, but written in language a general reader can easily follow, Sustaining Life argues that we can no longer see ourselves as separate from the natural world, nor assume that we will not be harmed by its alteration. Our health, as the authors so vividly show, depends on the health of other species and on the vitality of natural ecosystems. With a foreword by E.O. Wilson and a prologue by Kofi Annan, and more than 200 poignant color illustrations, Sustaining Life contributes essential perspective to the debate over how humans affect biodiversity and a compelling demonstration of the human health costs. It is the winner of the Gerald L. Young Book Award in Human Ecology Best Sci-Tech Books of 2008 for Biology by Gregg Sapp of Library Journal

T1  - Sodium Gill Potential as a Tool to Monitor Valve Closure Behavior in Freshwater Clam Corbicula fluminea in Response to Copper
AN  - 1537467853
AB  - Valve closure behavior in freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea is a biologically sensitive endpoint. The purpose of this paper was to derive an electrophysiological response model of C. fluminea to assess copper (Cu)-sodium (Na) interactions in gill membrane, whereby valve closure behavior and Cu toxicity could be monitored. The proposed model was based on the integration of Cu bioavailability, Na and Cu internalizations, and electrochemically-based gill potentials. Based on Na active transport under non-equilibrium conditions, predicted gill potential of -8.2 mV agreed reasonably well with published the measured transepithelial potential of -7 mV in C. fluminea. Our proposed framework captured the general features observed in model applications including: (i) 50% inhibitory Cu2+ activities for Na membrane potential (ENa) and uptake rate (JNa) were estimated to be 0.072 and 0.043 mM, respectively, with a stoichiometry of 3Cu2+: 1ENa and 1JNa; (ii) the external Cu2+-dependent internal Na concentration could be parsimoniously estimated, and (iii) the site-specific clam gill potentials could be monitored. Here we provided a new approach to monitor waterborne metal toxicity to reduce the nationwide economic losses due to bans on harvesting of contaminated clam and the potential risks to the health of clams.

AB  - The science centre says that today "any cultured pearl sold in the world has a piece of North American unionid shell as its core. Further decline in unionid populations has led to widespread poaching of animals from areas not open to harvest." One reason that "it is now against the law to possess a live unionid or a unionid shell in the state of Michigan."

T1  - Language of the Earth:&nbsp;A Literary Anthology
AN  - 2131749046
AB  - Man's complex relationship to planet Earth is explored in this new edition of the landmark literary anthology, Language of the Earth. This volume provides a portrait of the planet as experienced not just by scientists, but by artists, aviators, poets, philosophers, novelists, historians, and sociologists as well. It seeks to represent the human experience over the centuries, covering a span of 2,500 years. 
At the same time, 
Language of the Earth reflects the planet's extraordinary diversity, from dripping mines and caves to the high deserts of the Andes, the Antarctic ice sheet, and even the surface of the moon. Its comprehensive approach bridges the gap between science and the humanities. Arranged in four distinct parts, with writings from 117 different authors,

AB  - "We're taking real action; action to clean up our Great Lakes, action to protect species at risk, action to protect habitat."

              
The first three species were kept off the list because of a perceived need to consult further with the Nunavut Wildlife Management Board. The other three weren't listed because of "socio-economic considerations."

              
"They're one of the smallest government departments in terms of funding . . . they don't get enough funding to do their job properly."

AB  - There are also problems with adding species to the endangered list, including some populations of grizzlies, belugas, caribou, cod, sturgeon and salmon. And the departments haven't designated critical habitat areas for most of the troubled species.                Cleanup of the Great Lakes Basin is lagging, with harbours tainted by toxic sediments. Foreign species continue to invade Canadian waters. The report also slams Ottawa for failing to properly monitor genetically engineered fish, which could pose a threat to native species.

AB  - Invasive species are not a new problem, but they have recently become a much bigger, more widespread, and often more serious problem than in most earlier times. Schmidt relates the problem concerning with the ecosystem to a principle like of a stitch, where a small repair on a fabric that's starting to fray may prevent the need for a much larger one later, if one waits for the damage to get worse.

AN  - 2135235204
AB  - The five-volume Berkshire Encyclopedia of China is truly a 21st-century work with its coverage of environmental issues, global economics, online communications, and the latest political developments. While these volumes include many articles about China’s earliest history—going back 5,000 years and even further into the past—the Encyclopedia of China is focused on the events, concepts, and people that matter today. The authors of its 800 articles are scholars at major Chinese and Western universities and research institutes. The accessibly written and lavishly illustrated articles range from 600 to 6,000 words. Article titles appear in English and in Chinese with pinyin transliterations and tones to help those studying the language, while primary text sidebars add historical perspective. The Berkshire Encyclopedia of China provides unrivaled insight into China’s past, present, and future.

T1  - Fish Reproduction
AN  - 2131017413
AB  - With the decline in world fish stocks, our knowledge of fish reproduction has become fundamental. Reproduction is an essential commitment to future generation. It is also a continuous development process throughout ontogeny, requiring energetic, ecological, physiological, anatomical, biochemical and endrocrinological adaptations. The first chapters highlight important issues affecting fish normal ways of reproductive development; details would focus on species living in opposite environments, such as tropical and polar fishes; far related, as teleosts and cartilaginous fishes; and finally, fish having different reproductive strategies. Thereafter, since many fishes live in detrimental environments, mainly induced by the continuous input of xenobiotic substances into waterways, the authors found it highly pertinent to include this topic. Herein, the authors fix their attention on the factors and mechanisms that may well affect reproductionrelated hormonal systems as also on known consequences for fish living i

T1  - Trace Element Speciation for Environment, Food and Health
AN  - 2131426894
AB  - The ongoing progress of science has shown that it is important for analytical scientists to determine not only the presence of particular elements, but also their species. There are many fields where this is applicable, and where there are a number of topics to be addressed. Developing separation and measurement systems for the many element species has tested the resourcefulness of analytical chemists over recent decades. A product of the EU sponsored Speciation 21 Network, this book presents a detailed review of the state-of-the-art of speciation issues in the occupational health, food and environment sectors, along with the main conclusions arising from discussions held during expert meetings. Topics covered include mercury and organotin compounds in the environment; factors affecting the health of workers; the importance of speciation of trace elements for health, and subsequent metabolism in the body; analytical methodologies; risk assessment; and legislation. Trace Element Speciation for Environment, Food and Health provides an insight into applied research in the speciation field and how it has become so important in all the fields represented. With its comprehensive coverage, it will be of particular interest to researchers in industry and academia, as well as government agencies and legislative bodies.The ongoing progress of science has shown that it is important for analytical scientists to determine not only the presence of particular elements, but also their species.

T1  - Fish Histology:&nbsp;Female Reproductive Systems
AN  - 2148126372
AB  - Fish -- including cyclostomes, elasmobranchs, and teleosts -- display a wide variety of ways of coping with the stringent conditions they encounter in the aquatic environment. This diversity is especially evident in the female genital systems where some fish spawn profligate numbers of small eggs while others develop a few yolky eggs that may receive parental care. Parental care is carried to extremes in viviparity where eggs develop within the ovary or oviducts of the mother. 
This volume describes the myriad ways in which fish have approached problems of reproduction -- it is an amply illustrated comparative study of the microscopic structure of the female genital systems of fish. The timing of its appearance is auspicious in that it coincides with the decline of the golden age of descriptive morphology. It is a compilation of thousands of micrographs -- mostly electron micrographs -- from classic works in the field and should prove valuable to investigators studying fish in areas such as ecology, physiology, and reproductive biology who may view histology as essential in their work but have little background in this area. It includes chapters on the origin of genital systems, the structure of ovarian follicles, mechanisms of ovulation, the cortical reaction, oviducts, oviparity, and amazing examples of viviparity.

T1  - Darwinian Detectives:&nbsp;Revealing the Natural History of Genes and Genomes
AN  - 2135815910
AB  - Biology is often viewed today as a bipartisan field, with molecular level genetics guiding us into the future and natural history (including ecology, evolution, and conservation biology,) chaining us to a descriptive scientific past. In Darwinian Detectives, Norman Johnson bridges this divide, revealing how the tried and true tools of natural history make sense of the newest genomic discoveries. Molecular scientists exploring newly sequenced genomes have stumbled upon quite a few surprises, including that only one to ten percent of the genetic material of animals actually codes for genes. What does the remaining 90-99% of the genome do? Why do some organisms have a much lower genome size than their close relatives? What were the genetic changes that were associated with us becoming human? As molecular biologists uncover these and other new mysteries, evolutionary geneticists are searching for answers to such questions. Norman Johnson captures the excitement of the hunt for our own genetic history. Through lively anecdotes, he explores how researchers detect natural selection acting on genes and what this genetic information tells us about human origins.

T1  - Status of Pollinators in North America
AN  - 2131040313
AB  - Pollinators--insects, birds, bats, and other animals that carry pollen from the male to the female parts of flowers for plant reproduction--are an essential part of natural and agricultural ecosystems throughout North America. For example, most fruit, vegetable, and seed crops and some crops that provide fiber, drugs, and fuel depend on animals for pollination. This report provides evidence for the decline of some pollinator species in North America, including America's most important managed pollinator, the honey bee, as well as some butterflies, bats, and hummingbirds. For most managed and wild pollinator species, however, population trends have not been assessed because populations have not been monitored over time. In addition, for wild species with demonstrated declines, it is often difficult to determine the causes or consequences of their decline. This report outlines priorities for research and monitoring that are needed to improve information on the status of pollinators and establishes a framework for conservation and restoration of pollinator species and communities.

T1  - Mammoth goby caught in harbour: [Final Edition]
AN  - 358918346
AB  - I'm a recreational angler, so I have some knowledge of native Ontario species. The goby is a bottom-dwelling fish that has great potential for causing impacts on Great Lakes fisheries. Originally, the round goby and the tubenose goby were introduced into the St. Claire River in 1990, probably via contaminated ballast water of transoceanic ships. The fish is known to have spread throughout the Great Lakes and research studies have confirmed its presence in Hamilton Harbour.

              
   Considering Hamilton Harbour is one of the most polluted areas on Lake Ontario, it makes perfect sense the Goby would find a home here.

              
   In order to confirm Mr. [Christopher Hatfield]'s catch, the ministry is sending a Conservation Officer to Hamilton on Sunday, April 1.

T1  - Visual Thought:&nbsp;The Depictive Space of Perception
AN  - 2131919131
AB  - This volume starts from an interdisciplinary expertise of the contributors, and chooses to work on the very origins of conscious qualitative states in perception. The leading research paradigm can be synthesized in 'phenomenology to neurons to stimuli, and backwards', since as a starting point it has taken the phenomenal appearances in the visual field. Specifically, the leading theme of the volume is the co-presence and interaction of diverse types of spaces in vision, like the optical space of psychophysics and of neural elaboration, the qualitative space of phenomenal appearances, and its relation with the pictorial space of art. The contributors to the volume agree in arguing that those spaces follow different rules of organization, whose specific singularity and reciprocal dependence have to be individuated, as a preliminary step to understand the architecture of the conscious awareness of our environment and to conceive its potential implementation in constructing any kind of embodied intentional agents.

T1  - The Agricultural Revolution in Prehistory:&nbsp;Why Did Foragers Become Farmers?
AN  - 2131330232
AB  - The Agricultural Revolution in Prehistory addresses one of the most debated and least understood revolutions in the history of our species, the change from hunting and gathering to farming. Graeme Barker takes a global view, and integrates a massive array of information from archaeology and many other disciplines, including anthropology, botany, climatology, genetics, linguistics, and zoology. Against current orthodoxy, Barker develops a strong case for the development of agricultural systems in many areas as transformations in the life-ways of the indigenous forager societies, and argues that these were as much changes in social norms and ideologies as in ways of obtaining food. With a large number of helpful line drawings and photographs as well as a comprehensive bibliography, this authoritative study will appeal to a wide general readership as well as to specialists in a variety of fields.

T1  - Mockingbird Song:&nbsp;Ecological Landscapes of the South
AN  - 2130995289
AB  - The American South is generally warmer, wetter, weedier, snakier, and more insect infested and disease prone than other regions of the country. It is alluring to the scientifically and poetically minded alike. With 
Mockingbird Song, Jack Temple Kirby offers a personal and passionate recounting of the centuries-old human-nature relationship in the South. Exhibiting violent cycles of growth, abandonment, dereliction, resettlement, and reconfiguration, this relationship, Kirby suggests, has the sometimes melodious, sometimes cacophonous vocalizations of the region's emblematic avian, the mockingbird.
 
 
 
 In a narrative voice marked by the intimacy and enthusiasm of a storyteller, Kirby explores all of the South's peoples and their landscapes--how humans have used, yielded, or manipulated varying environments and how they have treated forests, water, and animals. Citing history, literature, and cinematic portrayals along the way, Kirby also relates how southerners have thought about their part of Earth--as a source of both sustenance and delight.

T1  - Biogeochemistry of Estuaries
AN  - 2132060749
AB  - Biogeochemistry of Estuaries offers a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach to understanding biogeochemical cycling in estuaries. Designed as a text for intermediate to advanced students, this book utilizes numerous illustrations and an extensive literature base to impart the current state-of-the-art knowledge in this field. While many of the existing books in estuarine science are comprised of edited volumes, typically focused on highly specific topics in estuaries,Biogeochemistry of Estuaries provides, for the first time, a unique foundation in the areas of geomorphology, geochemistry, biochemistry, aqueous chemistry, and ecology, while making strong linkages (trhoughout the text) to ecosystem-based processes in estuarine sciences. Estuaries, located at the interface between land and the coastal ocean are dynamic, highly productive systems that, in many cases, have been historically associated with development of many of the great centers of early human civilization. Consequentially, these systems have and continue to be highly impacted by anthropogenic inputs. This timely book takes the foundational basis of elemental cycling in estuarine and applies it to estuarine management issues. Biogeochemistry of Estuaries will be welcomed by estuarine/marine scientists, ecologists, biogeochemists, and environmentalists around the world.

AN  - 363020572
AB  - The fat, snake-like creature that drew crowds of anglers to a small display table at the Orillia Perch Festival was one of several invasive species being held up as a warning to the region's fishing folk.

              
   "The more of this stuff we have, the tougher it is for native species to survive," said Warren Howes, president of the Twin Lakes Conservation Club.

T1  - Group reviewing dated Great Lakes treaty; 'There are matters of science so out of date, they're not helpful': [Final Edition]
AN  - 270261473
AB  - That's why Gail Krantzberg, director of McMaster University's Dofasco Centre for Engineering and Public Policy and former director of the IJC's Great Lakes regional office in Windsor, is enthusiastic about participating in a year-long review of the agreement that is just beginning.                 She expects that view to be voiced by members of the Great Lakes- St. Lawrence Cities Initiative chaired by the mayors of Toronto and Chicago. Hamilton, Halton Region, Oakville, Port Colborne, Wainfleet and Niagara-on-the-Lake are members.                 Krantzberg, who spent a decade as a Great Lakes policy analyst for the Ontario Environment Ministry, praises the province for its Source Water Protection Act aimed at ensuring safety of ground water, but suggests it be expanded to include the Great Lakes.

T1  - Foodborne Parasites
AN  - 2147585076
AB  - Microbiologists are being challenged as foodborne outbreaks are increasingly being observed worldwide. Most of these outbreaks are associated with viral and bacterial pathogens such as Campylobacter, Salmonella, and lately Escherichia coli O157:H7, which emerged in the 1990s. Although parasites have been evolving with Man since antiquity, the control and eradication of these diseases are still far from being achieved. They are more frequently being reported in the literature as causative agents of food and waterborne illnesses. 
Foodborne Parasites examines the two major parasite groups that are transmitted via water or foods: the protozoa, which are single celled organisms, and the helminths. The helminths are classified in three sub groups: cestodes (tapeworms), nematodes (round worms), and trematodes (flukes). To better understand their significance, each chapter covers the biology, mechanisms of pathogenesis, epidemiology, treatment, and inactivation of these parasites. 
This important new text is crucial to a better understanding of the biology and control of parasitic infections necessary to reduce and eliminate future outbreaks in the U.S. and elsewhere.Serves as a reference book for students and professionals in food science as well as public health Reviews the two major parasite groups that are transmitted via water or foods: the protozoa and the helminths Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras

AN  - 2133261189
AB  - Authors are pioneers of sampling approach and developers of globally applied semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) 
Book summarizes the work of 15 years of research reported in almost 200 refereed papers and critically discusses their implications 
Boosts readers' understanding of how passive samplers such as SPMD function by examining basic exchange processes that mediate the concentration of SVOCs in a sampling matrix 
Book delineates both fundamental theory and modeling needed for full development of new technology, while providing a practical guide for its proper application 
Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras
JIM PETTY, Regional Science Program Manager, US Geological Survey (GS) Central Region BRD, received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1975 from the University of Missouri-Columbia. Prior to assuming his current regional role, Dr. Petty conducted and directed research in all aspects of environmental chemistry from the development of analytical methods for emerging contaminants of concern and the identification of unknown contaminants to fate studies to better define the bioavailability/bioconcentration of contaminants and their potential adverse effects on organisms. Furthermore, he has developed and applied systems and approaches for ensuring science quality. Dr. Petty has served as the Chief, Environmental Chemistry Branch, USGS''s Columbia Environmental Research Center; Director of Analytical Research at the Fermenta Animal Health Company; he was the Chief of the Quality Assurance Branch of the US Environmental Protection Agency¢ s Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory-Las Vegas; and the Chief Chemist of the US Fish and Wildlife Service''s National Fisheries Contaminant Research Center. Dr. Petty is an adjunct professor of chemistry and member of the doctoral faculty of the University of Missouri-Columbia and has directed the thesis research of two doctoral students and one masters student. He has authored or co-authored more than 100 peer-reviewed publications, numerous presentations at scientific meetings, and six U.S. Government patents covering a wide array of research topics.
 
 
JAMES HUCKINS began his career rather abruptly after being drafted into the US Army''s Chemical Corps, while enrolled in geochemistry graduate school at the University of Missouri at Rolla. Afterwards, he was employed as an analytical methods chemist by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service''s (F&WS) Fish Pesticide Research Laboratory. During this period he developed or co-developed a number of widely used analytical methods for organic contaminants and his research enabled the selective separation of toxic planar halogenated aromatic compounds from environmental matrices. Then his research interest broadened to include environmental chemistry and he served as leader of the Fate of the Chemical Section at the F&WS''s/National Biological Survey''s National Fisheries Contaminant Research Center. More recently, he has served as leader of the Chemical Fate and Dynamics Section of the US Geological Survey''s Columbia Environmental Research Center. He is the author or co-author of four US Government Patents on passive sampling (including SPMDs) and five other US Government Patents related to chromatographic systems. During his career he has authored or co-authored about 90 peer-reviewed articles/publications and has received more than 15 awards for his research. These awards include the US Department of Interior''s meritorious Service Award and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry''s Government Service Award for his pioneering research on passive sampling technologies.
 
 
KEES BOOIJ was educated as a physical chemist and chemical technologist. He obtained his PhD in chemical oceanography in 1989 at the University of Groningen (The Netherlands) on solute exchange between sediment and water. Since 1989 he was employed as a scientist at the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research, working on the fate of organic contaminants in the marine environment. After some initial unsatisfactory experiences with batch extraction techniques for determining dissolved organic contaminant concentrations in sea water, he became interested in the evaluation of semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs) for determining dissolved contaminants in both sea water and air. Early on he recognized the importance of boundary layers in exchange processes related to passive samplers. In a seminal paper on SPMDs, he demonstrated the dramatic effects on SPMD sampling rates of significant difference in facial flow velocities and highlighted methodology to account for this environmental variable. Over the past few years, his main interest has been to model the basic processes that govern the kinetics of solute exchange between passive samplers and water/air, aiming to strengthen passive sampling technology as a practical tool for contaminant fate assessment. He has authored or co-authored 25 publications in the peer-reviewed literature.

T1  - Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract
AN  - 2131784923
AB  - FROM THE PREFACE: The original purpose of the First Edition of Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract'to collect in one set of volumes the most current and comprehensive knowledge in our field'was also the driving force for the Fourth Edition. The explosion of information at the cellular level, made possible in part by the continued emergence of powerful molecular and cellular techniques, has resulted in a greater degree of revision than that of any other edition. The first section, now titled Basic Cell Physiology and Growth of the Gl Tract contains numerous new chapters on topics such as transcriptional regulation, signaling networks in development, apoptosis, and mechanisms in malignancies. Most of the chapters in this section were edited by Juanita L. Merchant. Section II has been renamed Neural Gastroenterology and Motility and has been expanded from seven chapters with rather classic titles to more than twenty chapters encompassing not only the movement of the various parts of the digestive tract but also cell physiology, neural regulation, stress, and the regulation of food intake. Almost all of the chapters were recruited and edited by Jackie D. Wood. The third section is entirely new and contains chapters on Immunology and Inflammation which were edited by Kim E. Barrett. The fourth section on the Physiology of Secretion consists of chapters with familiar titles, but with completely updated information to reflect the advances in our understanding of the cellular processes involved in secretion.

T1  - Proposals could help walleye: province: [Final Edition]
AN  - 352563112
AB  - New size limit and protected slot size regulations are also on the table. It is proposed that walleye greater than 50 centimetres long or less than 40 cm long may be kept. Two protected slots sizes are proposed for Zone 17 and three other zones in southern Ontario, including 35 to 55 cm and 40 to 65 cm.

              
   It is unknown what would happen to the protected slot limits introduced in Balsam and Mitchell lakes in 2001 until after the public consultation process, [Beechie] said. Catch limits of three walleye were introduced along with a slot limit of 37 to 55 cm.

              
   The Southern Region Walleye Review began in 2001 found the numbers of large walleye, particularly mature females, were low compared to other parts of the province, the MNR said. A netting project found the 'relative abundance' of walleye in the southern region to be 4.3 per cent, while the northeast ministry region averaged 9.2 per cent and the northwest 13.7 per cent.

T1  - Liberals pledge to clean up waters: [Final Edition]
AN  - 362410888
AB  - Joe Volpe, Liberal candidate for Eglinton-Lawrence, announced the plan as a "cleanup strategy for Toronto Harbour" that will open city beaches "sooner and longer," leave less pollution in waterways and improve parks, habitats, trails and waterfronts. "These investments will go a long way toward protecting the integrity of the world's largest freshwater ecosystem," he said in a release.

              
   [Mark Mattson] said billions more are needed to fix Toronto and the other spots jointly identified in the 1980s by Canada and the U.S. in the Remedial Action Plan for the lakes. Only two Canadian sites have been taken off the list, one is "in recovery" and 14, including Toronto, are still "areas of concern."

              
   Using federal records, the Toronto Environmental Alliance said the plant in 2003 released 314 tonnes of arsenic, lead, copper, cadmium and other toxic compounds. The federal government could use the Canadian Environmental Protection Act to force a phase-out of chemicals that are going to the plant and into the lake, said [Marilyn Churley], but argued the act has "been virtually ignored" and industries are allowed voluntary phase-outs that aren't working.

AN  - 2136200472
AB  - The Rhine, in many ways the most important river in Europe has undergone not only tremendous contamination but also recreation. This book clearly demonstrates that the Rhine is by far the best investigated water body worldwide. Many well known scientists have presented their knowledge in this book covering a wide span of different topics. The development of the Rhine, its catchment area and hydrology is as well presented as the development of water protection requirements and early warning systems on the Rhine. Additionally the book describes many aspects of water quality from the Rhine but also from alpine lakes, tributaries, estuary and adjacent coastal waters connected with the Rhine. This work provides a great deal of data obtained from the analysis and up-to-date monitoring of organic micro pollutants, such as e.g. pesticides, pharmaceuticals, synthetic aromatic sulfonates, chelating agents, industrial chemicals and by-products from chemical syntheses.

AN  - 2131100256
AB  - This book examines recent research into the molecular biology, genomics and transcriptomics of, and novel control strategies for, flatworm parasites. These include Cestodes (tapeworms) and Trematodes (flukes, schistosomes etc), which are the cause of a number of diseases of medical and veterinary importance. The book explores three main areas: phylogeny, genetics and transcriptomes; immunobiology, host-parasite interaction and control; and protein function, metabolism and physiology. Where appropriate, comparisons are made between different parasitic flatworms and between parasitic and free-living species. The book concludes by exploring future avenues for research. Contributors to the book include leading authorities from Europe, North and South America, and Australia.

T1  - Becoming Good Ancestors:&nbsp;How We Balance Nature, Community, and Technology
AN  - 2131391915
AB  - A brilliant writer and gifted big picture thinker, David Ehrenfeld is one of America's leading conservation biologists. Becoming Good Ancestors unites in a single, up-to-date framework pieces written over two decades, spanning politics, ecology, and culture, and illuminating the forces in modern society that thwart our efforts to solve today's hard questions about society and the environment. The book focuses on our present-day retreat from reality, our alienation from nature, our unthinking acceptance of new technology and rejection of the old, the loss of our ability to discriminate between events we can control and those we cannot, the denial of non-economic values, and the decline of local communities. If we are aware of what we are losing and why we are losing it, the author notes, all of these patterns are reversible. Through down-to-earth examples, ranging from a family canoe trip in the wilderness to the novels of Jane Austen to Chinese turtle and tiger farms, Ehrenfeld shows how we can use what we learn to move ourselves and our society towards a more stable, less frantic, and far more satisfying life, a life in which we are no longer compelled to damage ourselves and our environment, in which our children have a future, and in which fewer species are endangered and more rivers run clean. In the final chapter, he offers a dramatic view of the possibilities inherent in a fusion of the best elements of conservatism and liberalism. Our society has an inherent sense of what is right, says Ehrenfeld, and the creativity and persistence to make good things happen. It is now time to apply our intelligence, guided by our moral judgment, to the very large problems we all face. This book is an important first step.

T1  - Ecological Paradigms Lost:&nbsp;Routes of Theory Change
AN  - 2131778613
AB  - This edited volume in the Theoretical Ecology series addresses the historical development and evolution of theoretical ideas in the field of ecology. Not only does Ecological Paradigms Lost recount the history of the discipline by practitioners of the science of ecology, it includes commentary on these historical reflections by philosophers of science. Even though the theories discussed are, in many cases, are at the forefront of research, the language and approach make this material accessible to non-theoreticians. The book is structured in 5 major sections including population ecology, epidemiology, community ecology, evolutionary biology and ecosystem ecology. In each section a chapter by an eminent, experienced ecologist is complemented by analysis from a newer, cutting-edge researcher.  Reflection on the past and future of ecology A historical overview of major ideas in the field of ecology Pairing of historical views by ecologists along with a philosophical commentary directed at the practicing scientists' views by a philosopher of science Historical analysis by practicing ecologists including anectodal experiences that are rarely recorded Based on a very popular symposium at the 2002 Ecological Society of America annual meeting in Tucson, AZ

T1  - Each situation is unique, needs its own solution: David Hawke: [Final Edition]
AN  - 351690942
AB  - Sometimes it's a species that is nearing extinction, its population so low in number we can't stand the embarrassment of yet another one disappearing under our care. Mind you, to get good support for the program, the species has to be cute, noble or sport a pretty flower. Boring, mundane species don't garner much attention, even if it is the last of its kind.

              
   If you're still reading this (and thank you for hanging in) and are hoping, or expecting, for a miracle cure to the latest species invasion problem, sorry, I haven't got one. Nor does anybody else. Each situation is unique and needs its own solution. There is no magic book of impact-free management techniques for wildlife species that step outside their supposed bounds.

              
   To truly manage a species is almost impossible, as every species is connected to many other species. The type of soil, the amount of water and the range of temperature dictates what kinds of plants will grow in an area; the type of plants that grow will sustain certain species of herbivores; the population size of herbivores will limit how many predators can survive here; and the wealth and pressure of developers (who are serving the needs of people in general) will determine how quickly all of the above is impacted upon, altered or even trashed.

AN  - 352674789
AB  - "Twenty years ago, fishing in this lake was a waste of time (but) in the last five years the fishing has improved dramatically," he said, adding that rules imposed by the MNR that restrict the taking of large or small fish, and allowing anglers to keep only mid-sized fish, have helped

              
   "The adults stay in Georgian Bay and migrate up the Nottawasaga River and various tributaries - including Innisfil Creek - to lay their eggs in March and April. Brook trout are a resident species and remain in Innisfil Creek all year long - they are predominately in the headwaters near Line 5," he said.

T1  - Walleye quota drops, perch rises: [Final Edition]
AN  - 358027348
AB  - A 42,000 pound limit in the annual catch is a 78 per cent reduction over the last five years, said John Cooper of MNR. The quota will be in place until there is improvement in walleye stock in the eastern basin of the lake which extends from Long Point to Fort Erie.

              
   In 1999, sport and commercial fisherman agreed to an MNR five year rehabilitation plan to restore walleye, perch and other fish populations in the lake. Walleye increased in the western end of the lake but not the eastern end, where walleye from the Grand River tend to live. Some walleye from the western end do migrate into this district but in small numbers.

              
   After the meeting, [Rob Culp], who is president of the Dunnville District Hunters and Anglers Club voiced his disappointment about the walleye cap. This year's quota equals last year's harvest, he said. If walleye caps set five years ago were not loosened up too soon, stock could have rebounded, he said. Based on past experience, he hoped the industry and ministry learned and will react more quickly to fish stock drops.

T1  - Close canal to protect Great Lakes: Scientist: [Final Edition]
AN  - 361346953
AB  - He said authorities should look at all options to fix the problem, even drastic ones such as closing the Welland Canal, which allows access from Lake Ontario to the upper Great Lakes by ocean- going ships. The closure would surely cause economic, trade and logistical problems, but it would eliminate the spread of invasive species in all of the Great Lakes except Ontario, [Gary Fahnenstiel] said.

              
   Fahnenstiel said he would support a proposal by some Canadian scientists to stop transatlantic shipping at Montreal and have loads transferred to Great Lakes ships. That would lead to an environmental solution - and full use of the underutilized Great Lakes fleet - without closing the canal, he said.

              
   Since the 1830s, the Great Lakes have been invaded by many species. The sea lamprey decimated lake trout in several of the lakes by the 1940s. When the St. Lawrence Seaway was opened in 1959, ocean-going vessels brought more foreign species in their ballast holds.

T1  - The Cognitive Neurosciences III
AN  - 2131359227
AB  - The third edition of a work that defines the field of cognitive neuroscience, with extensive new material including new chapters and new contributors. Each edition of this classic reference has proved to be a benchmark in the developing field of cognitive neuroscience. The third edition of The Cognitive Neurosciences continues to chart new directions in the study of the biologic underpinnings of complex cognition--the relationship between the structural and physiological mechanisms of the nervous system and the psychological reality of the mind. Every chapter is new and each section has new participants. Features of the third edition include research that maps biological changes directly to cognitive changes; a new and integrated view of sensory systems and perceptual processes; the presentation of new developments in plasticity; recent research on the cognitive neuroscience of false memory, which reveals the constructive nature of memory retrieval; and new topics in the neuroscientific study of emotion, including the "social brain." The new final section, "Perspectives and New Directions," discusses a wide variety of topics that point toward the future of this vibrant and exciting field.

T1  - Nature:&nbsp;An Economic History
AN  - 2131149675
AB  - "Both ecological systems and economic systems are complex and adaptive, with self-organization and evolutionary change coupled in each; but the analogy is deeper, extending to the fundamental nature of how these systems are organized. This is the basic theme of Vermeij's masterful and scholarly book. From a biological point of view, Nature is a remarkable synthesis. Few people could have ventured out of their disciplines with such insights."
--Simon A. Levin, Princeton University
Geerat J. Vermeij is Distinguished Professor of Geology at the University of California, Davis. As an evolutionary biologist and paleontologist, he studies shells and the fossil and living animals responsible for building them. His books include 
Evolution and Escalation: An Ecological History of Life, 
A Natural History of Shells (both Princeton), and 
Privileged Hands. He received a MacArthur Fellowship in 1992.

T1  - Bones, Stones and Molecules:&nbsp;Out of Africa and Human Origins
AN  - 2132048987
AB  - Bones, Stones and Molecules provides some of the best evidence for resolving the debate between the two hypotheses of human origins. The debate between the 'Out of Africa' model and the 'Multiregional' hypothesis is examined through the functional and developmental processes associated with the evolution of the human skull and face and focuses on the significance of the Australian record. The book analyzes important new discoveries that have occurred recently and examines evidence that is not available elsewhere. Cameron and Groves argue that the existing evidence supports a recent origin for modern humans from Africa. They also specifically relate these two theories to interpretations of the origins of the first Australians. The book provides an up-to-date interpretation of the fossil, archaeological and the molecular evidence, specifically as it relates to Asia, and Australia in particular.  Readily accessible to the layperson and professional Provides concise coverage of current scientific evidence Presents a robust computer-generated model of human speciation over the last 7 million years Well illustrated with figures and photographs of important fossil specimens Presents a synthesis of great ape and human evolution

T1  - Shoe-horning down the canal; The 175-year-old Welland waterway is too narrow and shallow for the world's larger freighters But rapid expansion could drain the Great Lakes and damage ecosystems, writes Kevin McGran: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 438715664
AB  - "When the draft reconnaissance study came out in 2002, that was the  fifth time expansion has been proposed in one way or another since  the seaway opened in '59," says Jennifer Nalbone, Buffalo- based  spokesperson for the trans-border environmental group Great Lakes  United. They're opposed to expansion of the Great Lakes waterway  system and St. Lawrence Seaway.                 "An expanded system would mean more larger ocean-going vessels  would come into the Great Lakes. Currently, ocean-going vessels are  the No. 1 source of aquatic invasive species, which are completely  destroying the Great Lakes," says Nalbone.                 Another idea is to get smaller ships running on the seaway, taking  containers from ocean-going vessels in ports like Halifax and  Montreal, and bringing them to Great Lakes ports. That would have  the added benefit of keeping invasive species out of the Great Lakes.

T1  - Rights Resources and Rural Development:&nbsp;Community-Based Natural Resource Management in Southern Africa
AN  - 2131092878
AB  - Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) is an approach that offers multiple related benefits: securing rural livelihoods; ensuring careful conservation and management of biodiversity and other resources; and empowering communities to manage these resources sustainably. Recently, however, the CBNRM concept has attracted criticism for failing in its promise of delivering significant local improvements and conserving biodiversity in some contexts. This book identifies the flaws in its application, which often have been swept under the carpet by those involved in the initiatives. The authors analyse them, and propose remedies for specific circumstances based on the lessons learned from CBNRM experience in southern Africa over more than a decade. The result is essential reading for all researchers, observers and practitioners who have focused on CBNRM in sustainable development programmes as a means to overcome poverty and conserve ecosystems in various parts of the globe. It is a vital tool in improving their methods and performance. In addition, academics, students and policy-makers in natural resource management, resource economics, resource governance and rural development will find it a very valuable and instructive resource.

T1  - Niko's Nature:&nbsp;The Life of Niko Tinbergen and His Science of Animal Behaviour
AN  - 2259975085
AB  - A charismatic naturalist, bird-watcher, teacher, artist, photographer, film-maker, and winner of the Nobel Prize, Niko Tinbergen was a prominent and influential scientist. Jointly with Konrad Lorenz, he laid the foundation for a new science, the biological study of animal behaviour. 'Ethology', and his talent for devising behaviour-testing experiments, provided an outlet for Niko's enthusiasm for gulls and sticklebacks, snow-buntings and foxes, wasps and falcons, andeven children.This first full-length biography of Niko Tinbergen, lavishly illustrated with many of Niko's own drawings, describes his background in Holland, a naturalists' paradise, and the beginnings of his investigations into the behaviour of birds, fish, and insects. Hans Kruuk also explores is Niko's relationship with his colleague and co-Nobelist Konrad Lorenz. These were two men full of contrasts: Niko a charming, self-effacing field man and experimenter; Konrad a flamboyant and egocentric German,always full of new ideas. Niko's Nature goes on to follow Niko's progress in Oxford after the Second World War, where he became the world authority on the behaviour of animals in the wild: his inspiring book The Study of Instinct remains an all-time classic.As a scientist Niko will always be known for the four fundamentally different ways in which he asked the question 'why does an animal do this?' These questions, about physiology, development, evolution, and function, became known as 'Tinbergen's four whys'. But Niko's successes came at a price - severe and devastating depressions that were to plague him throughout his career.In this fascinating and engaging story, Niko's long-time friend and student Hans Kruuk argues that his impact as a scientist and naturalist was in large part due to his skills as a communicator, photographer, and film-maker. Niko's Nature is an intimate and insightful portrait of an extraordinary figure.

T1  - Imagining the Nation in Nature:&nbsp;Landscape Preservation and German Identity, 1885-1945
AN  - 2131770778
AB  - One of the most powerful nationalist ideas in modern Europe is the assertion that there is a link between people and their landscape. Focusing on the heart of German romanticism, the Rhineland, Thomas Lekan examines nature protection activities from Wilhelmine Germany through the end of the Nazi era to illuminate the relationship between environmental reform and the cultural construction of national identity. In the late nineteenth century, anxieties about national character infused ecological concerns about industrialization, spurring landscape preservationists to protect the natural environment. In the Rhineland's scenic rivers, forests, and natural landmarks, they saw Germany as a timeless and organic nation rather than a recently patchworked political construct. Landscape preservation also served conservative social ends during a period of rapid modernization, as outdoor pursuits were promoted to redirect class-conscious factory workers and unruly youth from crass materialism to the German homeland. Lekan's examination of Nazi environmental policy challenges recent work on the green Nazis by showing that the Third Reich systematically subordinated environmental concerns to war mobilization and racial hygiene. This book is an original contribution not only to studies of national identity in modern Germany but also to the growing field of European environmental history.

T1  - Niko's Nature:&nbsp;The Life of Niko Tinbergen and his Science of Animal Behaviour
AN  - 2135676867
AB  - A charismatic naturalist, bird-watcher, teacher, artist, photographer, film-maker, and winner of the Nobel Prize, Niko Tinbergen was a prominent and influential scientist. Jointly with Konrad Lorenz, he laid the foundation for a new science, the biological study of animal behaviour. 'Ethology', and his talent for devising behaviour-testing experiments, provided an outlet for Niko's enthusiasm for gulls and sticklebacks, snow-buntings and foxes, wasps and falcons, and even children.This first full-length biography of Niko Tinbergen, lavishly illustrated with many of Niko's own drawings, describes his background in Holland, a naturalists' paradise, and the beginnings of his investigations into the behaviour of birds, fish, and insects. Hans Kruuk also explores is Niko's relationship with his colleague and co-Nobelist Konrad Lorenz. These were two men full of contrasts: Niko a charming, self-effacing field man and experimenter; Konrad a flamboyant and egocentric German, always full of new ideas. Niko's Nature goes on to follow Niko's progress in Oxford after the Second World War, where he became the world authority on the behaviour of animals in the wild: his inspiring book The Study of Instinct remains an all-time classic.As a scientist Niko will always be known for the four fundamentally different ways in which he asked the question 'why does an animal do this?' These questions, about physiology, development, evolution, and function, became known as 'Tinbergen's four whys'. But Niko's successes came at a price - severe and devastating depressions that were to plague him throughout his career.In this fascinating and engaging story, Niko's long-time friend and student Hans Kruuk argues that his impact as a scientist and naturalist was in large part due to his skills as a communicator, photographer, and film-maker. Niko's Nature is an intimate and insightful portrait of an extraordinary figure.

T1  - What you can do for the Great Lakes: [Final Edition]
AN  - 352828152
AB  - The U.S. Senate is considering a bill that would screen ships entering all U.S. waterways to prevent further introductions of invasive species through ballast water. The $167-million bill was introduced by two Great Lakes senators from Michigan and Ohio.

              
   "Estimates of the annual economic damage caused nationwide by invasive species go as high as $137 billion," Senator Carl Levin of Michigan said in a statement before Congress in March. "(The bill) is a lot of money, but it is a critical investment. As those of us from the Great Lakes know, the economic damage that invasive species can cause is much greater."

              
   A binational citizens' group, Great Lakes United, has outlined a plan of action for a multitude of problems which it handed out to Great Lakes mayors attending a conference in St. Catharines last month.

T1  - Ban on imported leeches would be problem: [Final Edition]
AN  - 354637173
AB  - The BAO represents about 2,000 bait harvesters and bait sellers (dealers and tourist operators) in the province. The harvesters and sellers, [Paul Barber] says, do not have the infrastructure or sufficient identified leech habitat to make up the shortfall. He estimates that it will take an additional five years before Ontario bait harvesters are in a position to make up the shortfall of leeches.

              
   Barber says that the economic impact of the ban on imported leeches will be felt in Ontario bait and tourism industries for at least a decade. Ontario says it wants to ban the import of leeches because of the risk of importing exotic invading species with the leeches.

              
   The leeches, often called bloodsuckers, that plague swimmers in some lakes are not the same leeches that the bait industry harvests and sells. Bait leeches are often referred to as stealth leeches. At the moment there is no successful commercial culture of leeches in North America.

T1  - Industry labelled threat to species: [Final Edition]
AN  - 267045504
AB  - One of the most pressing concerns is the influx of invasive species, some of which have caused biological chaos and economic difficulty for forestry and marine industries, the report says.                 Kevin Kavanagh, the fund's director of biodiversity conservation reporting, said researchers were alarmed to discover how serious the danger of invasive species could be.                 The marine environment is also under severe pressure from both industrial initiatives and a changing climate, researchers found. Oceans have become overtaxed from intensive fishing and crowded by oil rigs drilling offshore, all of which have contributed to the collapse of fish stocks, the disappearance of some species and the degradation of waters on both coasts.

But is this argument wise? Must the human and natural worlds be adversaries?In this book, ecologist Michael Rosenzweig finds that ecological science actually rejects such polarization. Instead it suggests that, to be successful, conservation must discover how we can blend a rich natural world into the world of economic activity. This revolutionary, common ground between development and conservation is called reconciliation ecology: creating and maintaining species-friendly habitats in the very places where people live, work, or play.The book offers many inspiring examples of the good results already achieved. The Nature Conservancy, for instance, has a cooperative agreement with the Department of Defense, with more than 200 conservation projects taking place on more than 170 bases in 41 states. In places such as Elgin Air Force Base, the human uses-testing munitions, profitable timbering and recreation--continue, but populations of several threatened species on the base, such as the long-leaf pine and the red-cockaded woodpecker, have been greatly improved. The Safe Harbor strategy of the Fish & Wildlife Service encourages private landowners to improve their property for endangered species, thus overcoming the unintended negative aspects of the Endangered Species Act. And Golden Gate Park, which began as a system of sand dunes, has become, through human effort, a world of ponds and shrubs, waterfowl and trees.Rosenzweig shows that reconciliation ecology is the missing tool of conservation, the practical, scientifically based approach that, when added to the rest, will solve the problem of preserving Earth's species.

T1  - Animal Biotechnology:&nbsp;Science-Based Concerns
AN  - 2131902567
AB  - Genetic-based animal biotechnology has produced new food and pharmaceutical products and promises many more advances to benefit humankind. These exciting prospects are accompanied by considerable unease, however, about matters such as safety and ethics. This book identifies science-based and policy-related concerns about animal biotechnology?key issues that must be resolved before the new breakthroughs can reach their potential.
 
 The book includes a short history of the field and provides understandable definitions of terms like cloning. Looking at technologies on the near horizon, the authors discuss what we know and what we fear about their effects?the inadvertent release of dangerous microorganisms, the safety of products derived from biotechnology, the impact of genetically engineered animals on their environment. In addition to these concerns, the book explores animal welfare concerns, and our societal and institutional capacity to manage and regulate the technology and its products. This accessible volume will be important to everyone interested in the implications of the use of animal biotechnology.

AB  - [Ken Kobylanski] told the large crowd of club members, spouses and other guests, that there are now over 140 exotic species in the Great Lakes, species that are not natural to the lake system that have been introduced by human means.

              
   "We have to stop using the Great Lakes as a toxic waste dump, as a sewage dump, as a garbage dump," said Kobylanski. "We can't live without fresh water. We are poisoning ourselves."

T1  - Great Lakes health topic at conference: [Final Edition]
AN  - 361244860
AB  - [Harvey Shear] said some trends, such as drinking-water quality and contaminants in fish are looking favourable in all the lakes. Bald eagle, peregrine falcon and double-breasted cormorant populations are making a comeback, as are lake trout stocks in Lake Superior and Lake Huron.

              
   Shear said even though it's not sustainable, yet, there has been some natural reproduction of lake trout over the past few years. They were essentially wiped out by sea lamprey, overfishing and habitat loss in the 1950s and 1960s.

              
   Shear said sea lamprey continue to pose a threat to lake trout, but the lamprey population in Lake Ontario is under control.

T1  - Don't let Asian carp enter the Great Lakes: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349399475
AB  - Clearly, both the U.S. and Canadian governments must take concerted action to prevent the spread of this creature into the Great Lakes. The $700,000 yearly cost is cheap insurance which both governments can easily share. Otherwise, the invaders will be impossible to get rid of once they gain entrance to the lakes and start taking over. With no predators to stop them, the carp will continue to multiply.

              
   Unless they are stopped, the carp will have a devastating effect on commercial and sports fishing in our Great Lakes. Asian carp daily consume up to 40 per cent of their body weight in zoo plankton, vegetation, or mussels and fish. Because the females can lay up to one million eggs, they can quickly displace local species from their native habitats.

T1  - Biogeochemistry of Marine Dissolved Organic Matter
AN  - 2131396863
AB  - Interest in marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) is very high because it plays an important role in oceanic and global carbon cycling, which in turn impacts weather. Understanding the processes involved in the transformations of carbon, phosphorus, nitrogen, and other major elements in the oceans has been a primary goal of marine biogeochemists and oceanographers over the past decade.This book, in 16 chapters with over 170 figures and tables, reports on the major advances in this area by a distinguished group of international chemical and biological oceanographers. Additionally, it focuses on the role of DOM in elemental cycling - where the greatest informational need currently exists.  Biological cycling of the major elements through DOM is assessed throughout, with particular emphasis on the role of marine microbes as active agents in the processing of this materialThe ocean science community's advances for inclusion of DOM in both ecosystem and global circulation models are evaluated

T1  - Marine Biotechnology in the Twenty-First Century:&nbsp;Problems, Promise, and Products
AN  - 2132028700
AB  - Dramatic developments in understanding the fundamental underpinnings of life have provided exciting opportunities to make marine bioproducts an important part of the U.S. economy. Several marine based pharmaceuticals are under active commercial development, ecosystem health is high on the public's list of concerns, and aquaculture is providing an ever greater proportion of the seafood on our tables. Nevertheless, marine biotechnology has not yet caught the public's, or investor's, attention. Two workshops, held in October 1999 and November 2001 at the National Academies, were successful in highlighting new developments and opportunities in environmental and biomedical applications of marine biotechnology, and also in identifying factors that are impeding commercial exploitation of these products. This report includes a synthesis of the 2001 sessions addressing drug discovery and development, applications of genomics and proteomics to marine biotechnology, biomaterials and bioengineering, and public policy and essays contributed by the workshop speakers.

T1  - Swimming Lessons:&nbsp;Keeping Afloat in the Age of Technology
AN  - 2131250299
AB  - Never in history has life been so complicated and full of sudden changes. Technology, the environment, and the way we work and relate to one another are all in upheaval. With wit, humor, a calm voice, and great authority, Swimming Lessons gives a clear view of what our world has become - not just our successes, but also the destruction set loose by our own genius and inventions. In addition, it offers practical, non-utopian suggestions for keeping afloat in the dangerous waters of the 21st century's globalized civilization.Whether it is describing a comical brainstorming session in a Washington boardroom or a close encounter with an Alaskan grizzly and her cubs, Swimming Lessons is a delight to read. Trained in history, medicine, and zoology, David Ehrenfeld brings a grand perspective to his challenging task. He writes not just as a scientist, but as one who values and understands the social sciences and humanities as well. In the first half of Swimming Lessons, we learn to recognize the lies we live: about education, new military weapons systems, biotechnology, electronic pseudocommunities, and accelerated obsolescence. We also learn about the deadly corporate economics that affect every aspect of our lives, even environmental conservation. The second half reveals the pitfalls and opportunities in the main tasks we face: relating to nature in a manmade world and restoring our damaged communities.

T1  - North American prosperity creating environmental ills: [Final Edition]
AN  - 355535739
AB  - The report, "The North American Mosaic," was presented last week to the governments of Canada, U.S. and Mexico. It's the first publication of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, a tri- country agency based in Montreal and created under the North American Free Trade Agreement.                 Similar to the collapse of the commercial cod fishery in the Atlantic provinces, nearly one-third of the federally managed species of fish in the U.S. are over-fished.                 "People are beginning to realize what a wise investment it is to have environmental programs that are costly to implement, but pay off in the long run," she says, citing a recent study that found the U.S. Clean Air Act cost $245 billion (U.S.) to apply, but resulted in $6 trillion in economic savings during the past three decades.

T1  - Waterfowl die-offs an unfortunate reality of nature: [Final Edition]
AN  - 355470799
AB  - Over the last few years, a different twist to the botulism story has manifested itself, first in Lake Huron and then Lake Erie. Loons and mergansers have been dying by the thousand. And now dead fish are being found that appear to have been infected with Type E botulism, as well as some live fish showing clinical signs of a botulism infection.                 The first confirmed findings were in birds that died on Lake Huron. In 2000, there was nothing on Lake Huron, but the die-offs were seen in Lake Erie. "In 2001, it was in the middle and eastern basins of Lake Erie," [Doug Campbell] said.                 [Ward Stone] said it appears that loons and mergansers eat fish and die. The tested specimens had gobies in their stomachs. "We think gobies are definitely involved," said Stone. The round-nosed goby, an invasive fish species native to the Caspian Sea, was introduced into the Great Lakes a few years ago, probably through ballast water from a foreign freighter.

T1  - A Risk-Management Strategy for PCB-Contaminated Sediments
AN  - 2159399755
AB  - This book provides a risk-based framework for developing and implementing strategies to manage PCB-contaminated sediments at sites around the country. The framework has seven stages, beginning with problem definition, continuing through assessment of risks and management options, and ending with an evaluation of the success of the management strategy. At the center of the framework is continuous and active involvement of all affected parties--particularly communities--in the development, implementation, and evaluation of the management strategy. A Risk-Management Strategy for PCB-Contaminated Sediments emphasizes the need to consider all risks at a contaminated site, not just human health and ecological effects, but also the social, cultural, and economic impacts. Given the controversy that has arisen at many PCB-contaminated sites, this book provides a consistent, yet flexible, approach for dealing with the many issues associated with assessing and managing the risks at Superfund and other contaminated sites.

T1  - Inland Navigation System Planning:&nbsp;The Upper Mississippi River-Illinois Waterway
AN  - 2131412370
AB  - In 1988, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began an investigation of the benefits and costs of extending several locks on the lower portion of the Upper Mississippi River-Illinois Waterway (UMR-IWW) in order to relieve increasing waterway congestion, particularly for grain moving to New Orleans for export. With passage of the Flood Control Act of 1936, Congress required that the Corps conduct a benefit-cost analysis as part of its water resources project planning; Congress will fund water resources projects only if a project's benefits exceed its costs. As economic analysis generally, and benefit-cost analysis in particular, has become more sophisticated, and as environmental and social considerations and analysis have become more important, Corps planning studies have grown in size and complexity. The difficulty in commensurating market and nonmarket costs and benefits also presents the Corps with a significant challenge. The Corps' analysis of the UMR-IWW has extended over a decade, has cost roughly $50 million, and has involved consultations with other federal agencies, state conservation agencies, and local citizens. The analysis has included many consultants and has produced dozens of reports. 
In February 2000, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) requested that the National Academies review the Corps' final feasibility report. After discussions and negotiations with DOD, in April 2000 the National Academies launched this review and appointed an expert committee to carry it out.

T1  - Quota slashed to arrest walleye decline: Commission cuts Lake Erie catch by 59 per cent but experts say stocks will never return to '80s level: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349276944
AB  - "We will never get walleye stocks back to the level they were in the late 1980s," said John Cooper of the Ministry of Natural Resources' Lake Erie management unit.

              
   Cooper said the decline in the walleye has been largely driven by changes in the fish's habitat.

              
   "Now we have gobies (another alien species in the lake) and they are eating the mussels," said Cooper. "Some fish, like the walleye, are feeding on them. We don't know what effect this might have on the walleye."

T1  - Future Roles and Opportunities for the U. S. Geological Survey
AN  - 2131260500
AB  - The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has adapted to the changing political, economic, and technical state of the nation and the world since it was established in the late nineteenth century. Over a period of more than 120 years, the USGS has evolved from a small group of scientists who collected data and provided guidance on how to parcel, manage, and use the public lands of the West to an agency comprised of thousands of scientists who conduct research and assessment activities on complex scientific issues at scales ranging from the local to the global. The USGS will no doubt continue to evolve and adapt to meet changing national needs. In fact, the recent integration of the National Biological Service and parts of the U.S. Bureau of Mines into the USGS presents an ideal opportunity to examine the agency's vision, mission, role, and scientific opportunities as the organization begins the early years of the twenty-first century. The USGS recognized the need to adapt to changing demands when it asked the National Research Council (NRC) to undertake this study. The NRC formed a multidisciplinary committee of 16 experts to address issues related to the future roles, challenges, and opportunities of the agency.

T1  - Ballast inspection eyes alien species; Scientists looking for unwanted guests: [Final Edition]
AN  - 254386761
AB  - "Estimates are there can be up to 158 tonnes left behind," says University of Windsor biology graduate student Sarah Bandoni. Plenty, according to researchers, to harbour unwanted alien species.                 To analyse the potential threat of so-called No-BOBs (No ballast on board ships), a local team led by [Hugh MacIsaac], of which Bandoni is a member, will join a binational effort this year, boarding up to 40 No-BOB ships at their first Great Lakes ports of call and taking samplings of what's lurking at the bottom of their holds.                 At the current rate of unwanted foreign species entering the Great Lakes, Bandoni says "it's very possible" the researchers might even detect a potential newcomer. The targeted ships will all be arriving from busy European ports considered the likeliest boarding spots for exotic species stowaways, particularly in the Black and Caspian seas.

T1  - Youth & age: New flora and fauna for old
AN  - 224077198
AB  - Whether by choice or chance, when humans have gone to new places, other species new to those lands have always journeyed with them. Only recently has humankind realised the harm its species-spreading habits might be doing; and, nowadays, gone on, often, to forget the benefits. These days, even the accidental arrival of alien species is cause for great alarm. If an alien species no longer faces the predators and diseases that it evolved alongside, once established it may breed without restraint. Biologists call the process "ecological release". And, if the new species takes a fancy to a plant or animal that is widely farmed, or widely distributed, in its new colony, the resultant population explosion can have an extraordinary impact on agriculture and natural habitats.

T1  - Facing environmental challenges: [Final Edition]
AN  - 270022598
AB  - Canada is committed to high quality research, particularly in the Great Lakes. Our partnerships in applied research help strengthen management decisions in the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence ecosystem.                 In fact, we have renewed our commitment to the health of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Ecosystem three times. In 1998, for example, we confirmed the third phase of the St. Lawrence Vision 2000 in partnership with the Government of Quebec. In Budget 2000, we committed an additional $8 million per year to clean up the Areas of Concern through the Great Lakes Basin 2020 Action Plan.                 Having seen firsthand some of the Great Lakes management and clean-up initiatives. I know how important applied research is when scientific research is the foundation of management decisions; you're more likely to get results. If it isn't, research can easily get off track and over budget. The National Water Research Institute, stationed in my hometown of Burlington, is a leader in Great Lakes applied research.

T1  - Michigan shipping industry concerned law to sterilize ballast water would sink their seaborne business: [Final Edition]
AN  - 348055883
AB  - The DEQ's Office of the Great Lakes said about one-third of the roughly 145 foreign species in the lakes arrived in ballast water from foreign ships that entered the lakes via the St. Lawrence Seaway.

              
   Cmdr. Pat Gerrity of the U.S. coast guard said Michigan should seek a regional or federal approach, instead of going it alone. The coast guard enforces federal laws enacted in the 1990s that require foreign vessels bound for U.S. ports to dump their ballast water at sea to eliminate foreign species, he said.

              
   [Ken Sikkema] said most ships are exempt from the requirement because they have little ballast left by the time they enter the Great Lakes. Still, it's often often enough to keep non-native species alive.

T1  - Our Common Journey:&nbsp;A Transition Toward Sustainability
AN  - 2131245390
AB  - World human population is expected to reach upwards of 9 billion by 2050 and then level off over the next half-century. How can science and technology help to ensure that human needs are met while the planet's environment is nurtured and restored?
Our Common Journey examines these questions to draw strategic connections between scientific research, technological development, and societies' efforts to achieve environmentally sustainable improvements in human well-being. The book argues that societies should approach sustainable development not as a destination but as an ongoing, adaptive learning process. It proposes a strategy for using scientific and technical knowledge to better inform future action in the areas of fertility reduction, urban systems, agricultural production, energy and materials use, ecosystem restoration, and biodiversity conservation.
Our Common Journey documents large-scale historical currents of social and environmental change and reviews methods for "what if" analyses of possible future development pathways and their implications for sustainability. The book also identifies the greatest threats to sustainability -- in areas such as human settlements, agriculture, industry, and energy -- and explores the most promising opportunities for circumventing or mitigating these threats.
World human population is expected to reach upwards of 9 billion by 2050 and then level off over the next half-century. How can the transition to a stabilizing population also be a transition to sustainability? How can science and technology help to ensure that human needs are met while the planet's environment is nurtured and restored? 

Our Common Journey examines these momentous questions to draw strategic connections between scientific research, technological development, and societies' efforts to achieve environmentally sustainable improvements in human well being. The book argues that societies should approach sustainable development not as a destination but as an ongoing, adaptive learning process. Speaking to the next two generations, it proposes a strategy for using scientific and technical knowledge to better inform future action in the areas of fertility reduction, urban systems, agricultural production, energy and materials use, ecosystem restoration and biodiversity conservation, and suggests an approach for building a new research agenda for sustainability science. 

Our Common Journey documents large-scale historical currents of social and environmental change and reviews methods for "what if" analysis of possible future development pathways and their implications for sustainability. The book also identifies the greatest threats to sustainability?in areas such as human settlements, agriculture, industry, and energy?and explores the most promising opportunities for circumventing or mitigating these threats. It goes on to discuss what indicators of change, from children's birth-weights to atmosphere chemistry, will be most useful in monitoring a transition to sustainability.

T1  - Lake Erie PCB cleanup promised: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359181208
AB  - WASHINGTON - The U.S. government wants to steer more money into ridding Lake Erie of dangerous PCBs, an Environmental Protection Agency official said Tuesday.                 Production of PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, was banned in 1979 because of evidence that the toxic compounds caused deformities in fish-eating birds and concern about possible harm to people who eat fish from PCB-tainted waters. PCBs were used as an insulator in electrical equipment.                 The inventory of problems was part of a multiyear process leading up to a plan instructing U.S. states, and the federal governments of the United States and Canada on what they should be doing for each of the Great Lakes.

T1  - Georges Cuvier, Fossil Bones, and Geological Catastrophes:&nbsp;New Translations and Interpretations of the Primary Texts
AN  - 2131312292
AB  - French zoologist Georges Cuvier (1769-1832) helped form and bring credibility to geology and paleontology. Here Martin J. S. Rudwick provides the first modern translation of Cuvier''s essential writings on fossils and catastrophes and links these translated texts together with his own insightful narrative and interpretive commentary. 
Martin Rudwick has done English-speaking science a considerable service by translating and commenting on Cuvier''s work. . . . He guides us through Cuvier''s most important writings, especially those which demonstrate his new technique of comparative anatomy.OCoDouglas Palmer, "New Scientist"

T1  - Building a Foundation for Sound Environmental Decisions
AN  - 2131368479
AB  - Over the past decades, environmental problems have attracted enormous attention and public concern. Many actions have been taken by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and others to protect human health and ecosystems from particular threats. Despite some successes, many problems remain unsolved and new ones are emerging. Increasing population and related pressures, combined with a realization of the interconnectedness and complexity of environmental systems, present new challenges to policymakers and regulators.
 Scientific research has played, and will continue to play, an essential part in solving environmental problems. Decisions based on incorrect or incomplete understanding of environmental systems will not achieve the greatest reduction of risk at the lowest cost.
 This volume describes a framework for acquiring the knowledge needed both to solve current recognized problems and to be prepared for the kinds of problems likely to emerge in the future. Many case examples are included to illustrate why some environmental control strategies have succeeded where others have fallen short and how we can do better in the future.

T1  - Terms of endangerment: saving species begins with saving spaces for them
AN  - 216030931
AB  - IN MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER'S TIME, every third land bird in North America was a passenger pigeon. Ranging across Eastern Canada and the United States, these handsome birds moved in flocks so large they literally darkened the skies. In 1914, the last surviving passenger, a female named Martha, died in a Cincinnati zoo. The loss of the passenger pigeon is perhaps the best known of the human-caused species extinctions in North America. It was not the first, it may not have been the biggest and it certainly will not be the last. One hundred years ago our ancestors clubbed, shot, trapped, drugged and poisoned the passenger pigeon with incredible abandon. The very abundance of these birds, as with the buffalo, seemed to trigger a kind of contempt. Cruella De Vil, the villain in Disney's 101 Dalmatians, expresses this bizarre quirk of human psychology when she proclaims, "I love the smell of near extinction." Since then we have experienced a partial change of heart. Today we see individuals, descendants of those same ancestors that trashed the passenger pigeon, going to great lengths to save an obscure, economically useless, and slightly comical-looking bird called the burrowing owl. The last century has witnessed the development of a remarkable movement to identify endangered birds, mammals, fishes and plants, and to protect them from extinction. The story of the endangered species movement is really the story of a single, widely distributed and highly problematic species: Homo sapiens. It is a classically human story, pitting ignorance against scholarship, avarice against altruism, indifference against compassion. Endangered species grab our attention because we tend to respond, as a culture and perhaps as a species, to crises. Look at our society's approach to the two important activities of medical care and forest fire protection. Crisis response activities in both fields are highly organized, staffed and funded. Preventative activities, on the other hand, are assigned a much lower status, with small programs and intermittent funding. So too with endangered species; nowhere can you find data on the biology and dynamics of passenger pigeon populations when they were healthy, yet we carefully husbanded the last survivor, and marked not only the day but the hour of her passing. Our instinctive attitude toward other species seems to range from indifference to antipathy. Driving into a Saskatchewan farmyard once, I encountered a group of kids huddled around a tiger salamander that had made the fatal mistake of leaving a nearby dugout. The little girls in the group played at being terrified, and the little boys played at being brave, as they methodically smashed the salamander to bits. Concern for other species, particularly for those that have no immediate economic value to us, is a learned response, one we still struggle with. Economists tell us that the marketplace can assign a correct utilitarian value to every species. Market logic would determine the value of the cotton or the wheat plant, for example, to be quite substantial. On the other hand, the value of Furbish's lousewort, a curious plant found only on the Saint John River in New Brunswick and Maine, would be zero, since it has no marginal or exchange value. Fortunately, we are beginning to assign non-market, social values to species like the lousewort, the burrowing owl and the horned toad. But these values are in direct opposition to our present socio-economic system, according to which the lousewort and its friends are "useless." The commonly held view is that anthropogenic, or human-caused, species extinctions are a phenomenon of contemporary North American culture and technology. European immigrants certainly disrupted the natural ecology of this continent, but their actions were part of a universal tradition. Anthropologists now conclude that human-caused species extinctions have occurred throughout history. We tend to arrive on new land masses like the Hell's Angels at a church picnic: unexpected, ignorant and destructive. The pattern is monotonously similar. When immigrant humans colonize a new land mass, within hundreds or a few thousand years, a suite of wildlife species disappears. Yet it is also useful to acknowledge that the natural world can be ruthless with its creatures. There have been, and will be, species extinctions that humans have had absolutely no part in. Our ability to control nature is so extensive that it is difficult for us to accept that change is a fundamental dynamic of nature. The world around us is more a process than a fixed entity, as Canada's recent climate history amply demonstrates. Much of the country was empty and lifeless at the end of the last Ice Age, a mere 10,000 years ago.

T1  - Brown trout would be a bonus in Lake Simcoe: [Final Edition]
AN  - 437505312
AB  - The informative and educational quarterly Lake Simcoe Fishing Report, produced by the Ministry of Natural Resources, is a role model for other MNR districts.              If variety is the spice of life, Simcoe is seasoned to the hilt. Just about the only positive and beneficial addition would be brown trout, which would fill a niche not currently occupied and, should they find the lake to their liking, provide an exciting addition and huge tourist attraction. They thrive elsewhere in similar bodies of water.              Yet, nothing stays the same, be it by design or chance. Change isn't necessarily bad. Where would the Great Lakes be without rainbows, browns and salmon? Several species touted in the Lake Simcoe Fishing Report are relative newcomers to that body of water. The co-operative and delicious black crappie is the most recent arrival and you may be surprised to learn northern pike aren't Simcoe natives, but appeared around 1930.

T1  - Comparing Environmental Risks:&nbsp;Tools for Setting Government Priorities
AN  - 2140874087
AB  - The budgetary squeeze of the 1990s has made it obvious that the government cannot address every possible environmental problem. Comparative risk assessment (CRA) is increasingly advanced as the means for setting realistic priorities. RFF's Center for Risk Management commissioned background papers from leading experts on CRA for a meeting with federal regulatory officials. Comparing Environmental Risks presents the revised papers of this workshop. Representing the state of the art on programmatic CRA, its methodological analyses and practical recommendations will be invaluable to government officials, independent analysts, and anyone studying environmental policy.

T1  - Natural Selection:&nbsp;Domains, Levels, and Challenges
AN  - 2131388216
AB  - In this work, George C. Williams--one of evolutionary biology's most distinguished scholars--examines the mechanisms and meaning of natural selection in evolution. Williams offers his own perspective on modern evolutionary theory, including discussions of the gene as the unit of selection, clade selection and macroevolution, diversity within and among populations, stasis, and other timely and provocative topics. In dealing with the levels-of-selection controversy, he urges a pervasive form of the replicator-vehicle distinction. Natural selection, he argues, takes place in the separate domains of information and matter. Levels-of-selection questions, consequently, require different theoretical devices depending on the domains being discussed. In addressing these topics, Williams presents a synthesis of his three decades of research and creative thought which have contributed greatly to evolutionary biology in this century.

AN  - 2131281321
AB  - From robins nesting on window ledges to short-eared owls sailing low over snowy fields, pied-billed grebes diving for fish to catbirds singing on moonlit nights, Black introduces us to the birds of field and forest, prairie and pond. Whether describing red-breasted nuthatches gorging on suet at her feeder after a snowstorm or a flock of American goldfinches "all balancing gracefully on ripening oats,' she reminds us of the natural sights and sounds that we must appreciate and protect. Humorous, personal, engaging, and instructive, her essays provide a readily acessible body of information about Iowa's birdlife for both amateur and professional naturalists of every interest level.

T1  - Walleye, perch vanishing from Erie: [Final Edition]
AN  - 275353370
AB  - (CP) - Yellow perch and walleye are disappearing at an alarming rate from the waters of Lake Erie, the Ontario Minister of Natural Resources said Friday.                 There's also concern that white perch may be displacing yellow perch in the lake, said [Bud Wildman].                 White perch may be crowding out yellow perch because they share the same habitat and eat the same food, biologists say.

T1  - Petty gains in '91 dim Green hopes for '92 'Some people never, ever satisfied,' Jean Charest said when critics slammed his $3 billion federal Green Plan: [SA2 Edition]
AN  - 436529053
AB  - * Endangered species. In other Green Plan announcements, Ottawa said it would move to stop poaching and illegal exports of endangered species, and to preserve natural habitats. It also confirmed the goal of removing 15 Canadian species from the endangered list by 1995. During the year, at least 4,000 species were wiped out by destruction of tropical rain forests.                 * Water pollution. Environmentalists launched a campaign in Europe for a boycott of paper products from Canadian mills that use chlorine bleach, which discharges dioxins, furans and other dangerous chemicals. Ottawa issued a report that, for the first time, acknowledged the pollution is damaging the environment. Later it announced Canada's mills face stiff penalties if they don't "virtually eliminate" dioxin and furan emissions by the end of 1993. But it also said they could request extensions.                 * Great Lakes. A federal report acknowledged for the first time that toxic pollution in the Great Lakes is a threat to human health. Shortly before the report was released, Ottawa announced that as part of its Green Plan, it would spend $25 million to promote and research pollution prevention and virtual elimination of toxic emissions into the lakes. Critics called the plan cowardly and dishonest, since it failed to call for zero discharge of pollutants.

T1  - Lovely purple weed becoming a scourge: [SA2 Edition]
AN  - 436355472
AB  - The spread of purple loosestrife has been helped along by gardeners, who buy cultivated varieties from nurseries or take plants from the wild, since the plant makes an attractive garden flower. And developers also give purple loosestrife a boost; the land they clear creates good growing conditions, since the plant prefers full sun.                 In 1988, with funding from the Natural Heritage League, [Cathy Keddy] produced a report on purple loosestrife, recommending that the Ontario government determine which wetlands are most affected by the plant, that control strategies be developed, and that the plant be declared a noxious weed.                 Now, with a small amount of funding from Wildlife Habitat Canada, Keddy is doing further research on purple loosestrife at Presqu'ile Provincial Park near Brighton, Ont. She is studying the distribution and abundance of the plant, and determining the effectiveness of different control strategies.

T1  - FINDINGS INDICATE SHORELINE PROBLEMS: [FINAL EDITION]
AN  - 353320367
AB  - Commenting on the dead and dying cows, Mr. [Mark Hobson] said that a 60- foot buffer strip along the Rideau shoreline should be created to save this vital area. He said that this would keep activities, including farming, from damaging the shoreline -- an important zone crossed by most aquatic and flying species.

              
   The operational expenses were paid for by the Friends of the Rideau, a group of volunteers who help Parks Canada operate and monitor the historic waterway. The group raises funds by holding an annual Dinking or inflatable boat race in the Rideau Ferry area.

              
   The shoreline mapping is the first of a series on the Rideau Canal that the Friends of the Rideau plan to co-sponsored over the next few years. He said that the mapping would help control unauthorized shoreline development by establishing a record of the shoreline and its habitat.

T1  - Using Oil Spill Dispersants on the Sea
AN  - 2131970908
AB  - While major oil spills are rare, oil slicks can have disastrous environmental and economic consequences. This book summarizes research on the use of chemical dispersants: their effectiveness and limitations and the results of using them in different spill situations. Based on laboratory and field research as well as on actual case histories, this book contains a clear-cut set of recommendations for action, planning, and research. Of special interest is the chapter on the biological effects of oil itself and of oil treated with chemical dispersants.
