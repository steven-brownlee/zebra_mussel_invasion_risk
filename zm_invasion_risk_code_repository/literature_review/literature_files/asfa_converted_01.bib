	abstract = {Climate change interacts with the sources and cycling of contaminants, such as radionuclides, in the environment. In this review, we discuss the implications of climate change impacts on existing and potential future sources of radionuclides associated with human activities to the marine environment. The overall effect on operational releases of radionuclides from the nuclear and non-nuclear sectors will likely be increased interference or prevention of normal operations due to weather-related events. For certain radioactive waste dumped at sea and sunken nuclear submarines, the impact of climate change and ocean acidification on the release of radionuclides and their subsequent fate in the marine environment should be considered further. Fluxes from secondary sources of radionuclides in the marine and terrestrial environment and cryosphere will change in response to climate change impacts such as sea level rise, warming and changes in precipitation patterns. In addition, climate change impacts may increase the risk of releases of radionuclides from operational and legacy wastes on land to the marine environment. Overall, our synthesis highlights that there is a need to understand and assess climate change impacts on sources of radionuclides to the marine environment to meet environmental and management challenges under future climate scenarios.Inputs of radionuclides to the marine environment will be impacted by climate change, thus there is a pressing need to understand the existing and potential sources of radionuclides to assess the implications of climate change impacts, suggests a literature synthesis of radionuclide sources.},

Due to biological, chemical, and physical characteristics, nanoplastics can slip through cell membranes, being even more toxicologically important than microplastics. Thermal Desorption - Proton Transfer Reaction - Mass Spectrometry was used to analyze mussels from the Apulian region, Italy. All the analyzed organisms have plastics (values ranging from 10 to 187 ng of microplastics and nanoplastics per dry weight mg). The highest mass of plastics was detected in the size groups {\textgreater}2.2 µm (218 ng per dry weight mg) and 20–200 nm (187 ng per dry weight mg). Upscaling data we estimated that people in Europe could ingest more than 2 mg of nanoplastics per year through seafood consumption. The detected presence of nanoplastics in farmed mussels here presented contributes to establishing a baseline for monitoring these pollutants.Microplastics and nanoplastics are present in the tissues of farmed mussels from the Apulian region, Italy, according to quantification and identification of plastics using TD-PTR-MS and fingerprinting algorithms.},

	doi = {10.1186/s42269-024-01185-3},
	abstract = {BackgroundIndia has been using natural, renewable resources for dishwashing and cleaning since pre-Harappan times, which speak to the country’s rich biodiversity and long standing traditions of health and hygiene. The current review focuses on several Indian traditional dish wash materials that are categorized according to their mechanism of action as scrubbers and scrappers, abrasives, degreasers, deodorizers and saponin biosurfactant dish wash cleaning materials.Main body of the abstractScrubbers and scrappers include rice straw, bagasse, coconut coir, coconut brooms, jute and agave fibers, luffa, etc. Soil, clay, sand, crystal salt, lime, rice husk, bran, starch, ash (wood, dung, husk), charcoal, biochar, and other materials are examples of abrasives. Materials that contain organic acids, such as citrus, mango, gooseberry, tamarind, tomato fruits, are used as degreasers. On the other hand, Citrus peels, drumstick seeds, sour butter milk, etc., come under deodorizers. The saponin biosurfactant rich fruits and seeds of soapnuts, soap pod, green gram, Bengal gram, bitter Albizia, etc., function as surface active agents. A few of them use multiple mechanisms to clean the vessels. They are used in many forms (solid, powder, liquid, paste, sponge, fiber, scrub, broom) and obtained from a variety of plant plants (leaf, bark, stem, fruit, seed) as well as the earth’s crust.Short conclusionCompared to commercial, manmade surfactants, natural organic and biosurfactant cleaners have several major advantages over synthetic ones, such as their natural availability, affordability, renewability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, minimal environmental and human toxicity, hypo-human allergenicity and multifaceted biological activities. They are free from preservatives and carcinogenic byproducts, free from phosphate-induced eutrophication  and sustainable in terms of local resource use, fossil fuel independence and low carbon footprint production. In addition to kitchen utensil cleaning, few of them are utilized for their myriad of functionalities such as jewelry polisher, face mask, bathing soap, hair cleanser, hair conditioner and washing detergent. The use of renewable and natural cleaning materials aligns with several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 6, Goal 9, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14 and Goal 15.},

	abstract = {Bardawil Lake is a unique aquatic ecosystem that provides a habitat for various fish and other marine organisms. This study aimed to analyze the quality of fish species to prove that this lake is free of pollution, not other Egyptian lakes, due to the accumulation of some heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn) in various tissues of fish species that were caught from this lake. Thirty-five fish samples were caught during the Spring of 2018 from seven different species: Mugil cephalus, Liza auratus, Sparus aurata, Dicentrarchus labrax, Siganus rivulatus, Anguilla angilla, and Solae solea. The Association of Official Analytical Chemists methods using a spectrophotometer determined the biochemical composition. In contrast, atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) was employed to determine the heavy metals expressed by µg/g wet weight. Results exposed that the accumulation of essential micronutrient (Cu, Zn) content was higher than toxic elements (Cd \& Pb) in muscles in order to Zn {\textgreater} Cu {\textgreater} Pb {\textgreater} Cd. Muscles {\textless} gills {\textless} liver in order of all metals except Pb with order muscles {\textless} liver {\textless} gills. The metals studied in the muscles were lower than those set by the WHO and the EU standards. The carcinogenic risk with lower allowable limits of 1 × 10–6 to 1 × 10–4 in both normal and high consumption groups; target and total target hazard quotients (THQ \& HI) in muscles were {\textless} 1. The biochemical composition level was highest in the liver, except for protein, which was highest in muscle for all fish species. There is no evidence of harmful contaminants in the muscular tissue of the fish sampled from Bardawil Lake, although fishing activity. However, customers should know that health concerns may be associated with overeating fish.},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution ranks among the most severe environmental disasters caused by humans, generating millions of tonnes of waste annually. The extensive and unregulated use of plastics has led to ecotoxicity and environmental imbalance.Microplastics (MPs) are prevalent in aquatic environments, and these MPs further degrade into even smaller particles known as nano-plastics (NPs). Both MPs and NPs impact the environment by readily absorbing organic pollutants and pathogens from their surroundings, owing to their bigger surface area to volume ratio. This review focuses on the source of origin, bioaccumulation, and potential impact of MPs and NPs on aquatic organisms and human health.Additionally, the review explores various methods employed for identification and quantification of these particles in aquatic ecosystems. Sufficient information is available on their characteristics, distributions, and effects on marine ecosystems compared with freshwater ecosystems. For plastic particles {\textless}10 μm, more toxicological effects were observed compared with larger size particles, in aquatic life. Understanding the mechanism of action and ecotoxicological effects of micro/nano-plastics on the health of aquatic life across various trophic levels, as well as human health, is of utmost importance. We address knowledge gaps and provide insights into future research approaches for a better understanding of the interactive mechanisms between binary pollutants.},

	abstract = {ObjectiveEnergy density (ED) estimates for marine forage species have been limited, impeding our understanding of this important trophic level. We studied the EDs of eight key forage species: Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus, Atlantic Herring Clupea harengus, Silver Hake Merluccius bilinearis, Northern Sand Lance Ammodytes dubius, Atlantic Mackerel Scomber scombrus, Butterfish Peprilus triacanthus, northern shortfin squid Illex illecebrosus, and longfin inshore squid Doryteuthis pealeii (also known as Loligo pealeii).MethodsSamples were obtained during spring and fall bottom trawl surveys across five regions (Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, southern New England, northern Middle Atlantic Bight, and southern Middle Atlantic Bight) from 2017 to 2019. In the laboratory, we developed predictive relations between the percent dry weight (\%DW) and ED (kJ/g wet weight) determined by proximate composition analysis (n = 606; r2 = 0.76–0.98) to estimate the ED of additional samples (n = 4583). For each species, we modeled ED as a function of size, depth, season, and year (as factors) as well as location (latitude, longitude) using generalized additive models (GAMs).ResultAlewife, Atlantic Herring, Northern Sand Lance, Atlantic Mackerel, and Butterfish were classified as high-quality prey (ED {\textgreater} 6 kJ/g), although Atlantic Herring ED was nearly half the values reported in earlier studies. Silver Hake, northern shortfin squid, and longfin inshore squid were classified as moderate-quality prey (4 kJ/g {\textless} ED {\textless} 6 kJ/g). Most species had higher EDs in the fall following summer feeding than in the spring after spawning and/or reduced winter feeding. The best-fitting GAMs included weight, depth (by season), season, and year effects for most species. Location (by season) explained significant amounts of variation.ConclusionObserved variation in ED across regions, species, seasons, and years provides the empirical data necessary to consider hypotheses related to “upstream” regulation of ED (via environmental drivers and productivity) and “downstream” effects on recruitment for these forage species as well the species that prey on them.},

	doi = {10.1002/ece3.11191},
	abstract = {The pace of biological invasions has increased in recent decades, leading to multiple invasions and the potential dominance of invasive species, destabilizing local ecological networks. This provides opportunities to study new ecological species interactions, including predation. Tropical freshwaters have been particularly concerned by aquatic invasions and we focused here on the Martinique island (Lesser Antilles). We examined the predator–prey relationships involving invasive Thiarid snails (Tarebia granifera and Melanoides tuberculata) and the native Neritina punctulata, both confronted with a newcomer predator, the redclaw crayfish (Cherax quadricarinatus). We conducted several mesocosm experiments to assess the impact of crayfish predation on snail survival and the passive and active antipredator responses of snails. A first experiment indicated snail survival rates between 50\% and 80\%, depending on crayfish size and sex. Notably, there was a negative correlation between snail survival and male crayfish size and the predation method (shell crushing vs. “body sucking”) varied with crayfish size. The second experiment suggested no refuge size for snails, with both very small ({\textless}5 mm) and very large ({\textgreater}5 mm) unable to escape predation, regardless of crayfish size (from 77 to 138 mm) or sex. Finally, we investigated the escape behavior of Thiarids regarding three crayfish cues. Melanoides tuberculata tend to bury in the substrate and T. granifera to climb up aquarium walls, what was expected from their shell morphologies, and both responding to crayfish cues within minutes. Overall, C. quadricarinatus proves to be an efficient snail predator with limited escape options for snails, potentially contributing to the decline of certain snail populations in Martinique. This omnivorous predator might impact other native species across different groups, including shrimps and fish. Our study underscores the urgent need for monitoring efforts, solidifying the redclaw crayfish reputation as a dangerous invasive species for freshwater macrobenthic faunas worldwide.},

	abstract = {The world's 1.4 million lakes (≥10 ha) provide many ecosystem services that are essential for human well-being; however, only if their health status is good. Here, we reviewed common lake health issues and classified them using a simple human health-based approach to outline that lakes are living systems that are in need of oxygen, clean water and a balanced energy and nutrient supply. The main reason for adopting some of the human health terminology for the lake health classification is to increase the awareness and understanding of global lake health issues. We show that lakes are exposed to various anthropogenic stressors which can result in many lake health issues, ranging from thermal, circulatory, respiratory, nutritional and metabolic issues to infections and poisoning. Of particular concern for human well-being is the widespread lake drying, which is a severe circulatory issue with many cascading effects on lake health. We estimated that ∼115,000 lakes evaporate twice as much water as they gain from direct precipitation, making them vulnerable to potential drying if inflowing waters follow the drying trend, putting more than 153 million people at risk who live in close vicinity to those lakes. Where lake health issues remain untreated, essential ecosystem services will decline or even vanish, posing a threat to the well-being of millions of people. We recommend coordinated multisectoral and multidisciplinary prevention and treatment strategies, which need to include a follow-up of the progress and an assessment of the resilience of lakes to intensifying threats. Priority should be given to implementing sewage water treatment, mitigating climate change, counteracting introductions of non-native species to lakes and decreasing uncontrolled anthropogenic releases of chemicals into the hydro-, bio-, and atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The Mediterranean basin has faced an increased influx of invasive species since the Suez Canal expansion in 2015. The invasive lionfish species, Pterois miles, has rapidly established new populations in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, impacting local fish biodiversity. Here, we have developed a new, fast ({\textless} 35 min) molecular approach to detect and quantify P. miles environmental DNA (eDNA) in combination with a portable device for field-based analysis. Using a species-specific real-time colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qcLAMP) for the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene, we demonstrate a high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 0.002 ng DNA per reaction, equivalent to only 50 copies of the COI gene. The assay is specific to the target in the presence of closely related and co-occurring species, and it is quantitative over five orders of magnitude. We validated the assay using aquarium water samples and further demonstrated its utility on natural eDNA samples collected from locations around the island of Crete where P. miles had been sighted. P. miles was indeed detected in three out of nine locations, two nature reserves and a closed bay. Lack of detection in the remaining locations suggests that populations are still at a low density. We also demonstrate the feasibility of P. miles eDNA qualitative detection directly from the filter used to collect eDNA-containing particles, completely omitting DNA extraction. Overall, we present a new approach for fast and targeted eDNA quantification. The developed LAMP assay together with the quantitative real-time colorimetric detection approach open new possibilities for monitoring invasive P. miles in the field.},

The assembled genome has 37,696 protein-coding genes and 50.86\% repeat elements. A comparative genomic analysis revealed expansions of 752 gene families, mostly associated with biomineralization, and 237 genes under strong positive selection. Notably, the fibrillin gene family exhibited gene family expansion and positive selection simultaneously, and it also exhibited multiple high expressions after mantle implantation by transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, RNA silencing and an in vitro calcium carbonate crystallization assay highlighted the pivotal role played by one fibrillin gene in calcium carbonate deposition and aragonite transformation. This study provides a valuable genomic resource and offers new insights into the mechanism of pearl biomineralization.},

Here we surveyed epibenthic communities from a shipwreck in the Levantine Basin for temporal and spatial changes in the community in relation to chronic oil pollution, comparing results collected from an area of the wreck characterized by chronic oil leakage with another area not affected by oil. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) bioaccumulation analyses were integrated with characterization of the efficiency of xenobiotics biotransformation processes and antioxidant network of the scleractinian coral Madracis pharensis, chosen as bioindicator species. Results highlighted the two areas hosting different epibenthic communities over a period of 11 years. Significant changes in the percentage cover of M. pharensis could be the result of recent mass mortality associated to Marine Heat Waves. Biological investigation conducted in M. pharensis tissues revealed an increased content of PAHs in specimens collected from the oil-impacted area, coupled with an increased capability of oxyradicals scavenging capacity and a lower functionality of phase II biotransformation mechanisms associated to glutathione S-transferase. Overall, the results suggest that M. pharensis has the capability to develop cellular and physiological adaptations to chemical-mediated stress, with yet unknown possible energy trade-offs to sustain stress response.},

	abstract = {Aquatic invasive species are a serious and growing threat to biodiversity. Zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis) are freshwater invaders causing substantial ecological and economic damage across Europe and North America. Early detection of invasive mussels and other non-indigenous species is increasingly needed to prevent their establishment and spread. Environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques potentially offer higher sensitivity monitoring tools to complement more conventional methods for surveying adult and juvenile mussels and veliger larvae. eDNA assays are typically performed on small-volume (0.5–5 L) water samples that are concentrated by filtration prior to extraction and downstream processing. Sampling using a towed plankton net of a larger (64 μm) pore size can process orders of magnitude larger water volumes with the potential for increasing eDNA detection sensitivity. We compared the sensitivities of high-volume plankton tow net water sampling to filter sampling in three recently infested lakes in Canada and Minnesota, USA. Paired filtration and tow net samples were analyzed for Dreissena DNA using an established quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for the genus. Higher yields of Dreissena eDNA (more DNA copies) were recovered from plankton tow than from filtered samples in all 33 paired comparisons. In some cases, plankton tow samples were positive for Dreissena eDNA while lower-volume filtering produced a false negative detection. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of plankton tow net sampling for eDNA early detection of invasive mussels, a method that can be used exclusively or as a supplement to filter sampling. Our results further suggest that eDNA testing could be incorporated into monitoring programs that routinely use plankton tows for visual detection of invasive mollusk larvae, as well as other aquatic invasive and non-invasive species ranging from plankton to metazoans, including many fish.},

However, targeted eDNA assays are seldom validated for use across broad geographic areas. Here, we validated 46 new and previously published probe-based qPCR assays targeting invasive species throughout the continental United States. We drew upon current taxonomies, range maps, publicly available sequences, and tissue archives to evaluate all potentially sympatric confamilial species and genetically similar extrafamilial taxa. Out of 5276 unique assay-nontarget taxon combinations, we were able to test 4206 (80\%). We characterized levels of validation and specificity for each of eight federal geographic regions and provided an online tool with state-level information, as well as detailed assay descriptions in an appendix. Specificity testing benefited from extensive use of eDNAssay—a machine learning classifier trained to predict qPCR cross-amplification—which we found to be 96\% accurate in 649 unique tests that underwent paired in silico and in vitro testing. Predictions of assay specificity (the true negative rate) were 98–100\% accurate, depending on the classification threshold used. This work provides both an immediate resource for invasive species surveillance and demonstrates an enhanced in silico, geographically subdivided validation framework to aid in future large-scale validation efforts.},

Risk management authorities need tools to identify pathways and source regions of priority concern to better target efforts for preventing NIS introduction. The probability of a successful NIS introduction is affected by the likelihood that a marine species entrained in a transport vector will survive the voyage between origin and destination locations and establish an independently reproducing population at the destination. Three important risk factors are voyage duration, range of environmental conditions encountered during transit and environmental similarity between origin and destination. In this study, we aimed for a globally comprehensive approach to assembling quantifications of source-destination risk factors from every potential origin to every potential destination. To derive estimates of voyage-related marine biosecurity risk, we used computer-simulated vessel paths between pairs of ecoprovinces in the Marine Ecoregions Of the World biogeographic classification system. We used the physical length of each path to calculate voyage duration risk and the cross-latitudinal extent of the path to calculate voyage path risk. Environmental similarity risk was based on comparing annual average sea surface temperature and salinity within each ecoprovince to those of other ecoprovinces. We derived three separate sets of risk quantifications, one each for voyage duration, voyage path and environmental similarity. Our quantifications can be applied to studies that require source-destination risk estimates. They can be used separately or combined, depending on the importance of the types of source-destination risks that might be relevant to particular scientific or risk management questions or applications.},

	abstract = {The rate of biological invasions is steadily increasing, with major ecological and economic impacts accounting for billions of dollars in damage as a result. One spectacular example is the western Atlantic invasion by lionfishes. In the Mediterranean Sea, invasions from the Red Sea via the Suez Canal (termed Lessepsian invasions) comprise more than 100 fish species, including a recent invasion by lionfish. In light of the devastating effects of lionfish in the Caribbean Sea, understanding the dynamics of Mediterranean lionfish invasion is crucial. The Lessepsian lionfish invasion started in 2012, and rapidly spread to the central Mediterranean. Here, we used thousands of RAD seq genomic markers to study the population dynamics of this invasion. While we did not find a reduction in genetic diversity between source (Red Sea) and invasive (Mediterranean) populations (i.e., bottleneck effects), we found evidence of population structure within the invasive range in the Mediterranean Sea. We found that loci that are potentially under selection may play an important role in invasion success (in particular, genes involved in osmoregulation and fin spine sizes). Genomic approaches proved powerful in examining the ecological and evolutionary patterns of successful invaders and may be used as tools to understand and potentially mitigate future invasions.},

	abstract = {As invasive zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) continue to spread through the freshwaters of the United States, efforts have been made to develop mussel invasion risk assessments to focus invasion prevention, monitoring, rapid response, and macrofouling control on at-risk water bodies. Previous invasion risk assessments have been based on broadly applied single factors such as calcium concentration or summer water temperature or on global scale climate variables. While such factors applied on a nationwide basis provide a general overview of regions susceptible to mussel invasion, they do not determine mussel invasion risk for specific water bodies, which can be variable even among those that are closely adjacent. Furthermore, these broad risk assessments may over or underestimate risk due to lack of water body specificity. In order to develop effective mussel prevention and control strategies, managers need mussel invasion risk assessments that can be applied to specific water bodies allowing limited resources to be focused on those most likely to be invaded. This study reports the use of easily determined factors (i.e., calcium concentration, pH, salinity, and summer surface water temperature) to specifically determine mussel invasion risk for 133 Texas water bodies as a case study of simplistic methods with broad geographic applicability. The results indicated that 19.5\% of the water bodies had a minimal invasion risk, 9.8\% a moderate risk, and 70.7\% a high risk. This study demonstrates that these methods provide finer scale risk assessment for Texas water bodies in this case study, finding higher risk in western and southern regions than was predicted by climate-based risk assessments and more nuanced risk levels in the eastern region than predictions based on calcium alone. These methods can provide invaluable information for natural resource managers and water infrastructure operators on a broad geographic scale to guide monitoring and mitigation efforts.},

	abstract = {Dreissenid mussels (quagga and zebra mussels, Dreissena bugensis and polymorpha) continue to spread throughout inland waterbodies of North America. Although there are considerable management and mitigation efforts underway to prevent infestation of new waterbodies, there have been relatively few successful efforts to eradicate mussels once detected due to a lack of cost-effective treatments. Two potentially cost-effective molluscicidal agents, potassium chloride (KCl, also called muriate of potash) and copper (formulated as Earthtec QZ®), have successfully treated infested waters, but have varying efficacy under different water quality and temperature conditions, and to date have only been applied in moderate conductivity waters (defined here as {\textless} 400 µS/cm) common throughout North America. Natural resource managers need information on the efficacy of these chemicals in high conductivity waters more typical of riverine systems and arid climates, in addition to the range of water temperatures typically encountered in the field. We evaluated the dose-response of quagga mussels to KCl and Earthtec QZ® in high conductivity water (≈ 700-1,400 µS/cm) across a range of temperatures (10, 18, 22 °C) to determine appropriate doses and treatment duration resulting in 100\% mortality. Our data indicate that treatments in cool temperatures (i.e., 10 °C) may be challenging for eradication efforts in high conductivity waters because none of the KC1 treatments and only one copper treatment resulted in 100\% mortality within the experimental period. However, both KC1 ({\textgreater} 200 ppm) and copper (120 and 180 ppb) were consistently able to induce 100\% mortality in quagga mussels in warmer temperatures (i.e., ≥18 °C) and thus may be good candidates for field scale application in high conductivity waters. The results of this study indicate that field-scale application should strongly consider environmental conditions during the period of application when selecting dosages and treatment duration.},

	abstract = {Invasive Non-Native Species (INNS) are a principal threat to global biodiversity and the early detection of new introductions is key to facilitate a rapid response to limit the risk of establishment and spread. Related to this, there is growing interest in using environmental DNA (eDNA) for INNS detection. The applied use of eDNA in ecology is, however, in its relative infancy with few species for which regulator-approved methods are available. Here, laboratory trials were conducted to investigate the use of commercially available eDNA assays for detecting two high priority INNS in the UK, killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus) and signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), at different population densities. For killer shrimp, DNA of the expected fragment size was detected from all three trials where animals were maintained at a density of 1 per 1 L but species confirmation by Sanger sequencing was only possible for one of these replicates. Whilst capillary electrophoresis detected DNA of the expected fragment size in serially diluted samples down to a density of 1 shrimp in 100 L, this could not be confirmed by sequencing. Signal crayfish DNA was detected by qPCR in all four trials where animals were housed at a density of 1 per 10 L. Using serial dilutions, it was possible to detect signal crayfish in samples representing a density of 1 per 1,000 L, however this was unreliable. These results demonstrate the potential for using eDNA as a detection method for killer shrimp and signal crayfish but also highlights that detectability is species/assay specific and dependant on population density. The insights gained will help inform decisions surrounding the appropriateness of using these eDNA assays, and improve interpretation of any results generated.},

	abstract = {Human trade and movements are central to biological invasions worldwide. Human activities not only transport species across biogeographical barriers, but also accelerate their post-introduction spread in the landscape. Thus, by constraining human movements, the spatial structure of road networks might greatly affect the regional spread of invasive species. However, few invasion models have accounted for the topology of road networks so far, and its importance for explaining the regional distribution of invasive species remains mostly unexplored. To address this issue, we developed a spatially explicit and mechanistic human-mediated dispersal model that accounts and tests for the influence of transport networks on the regional spread of invasive species. Using as a model the spread of the invasive ant Lasius neglectus in the middle Rhône valley (France), we show that accounting for the topology of road networks improves our ability to explain the current distribution of the invasive ant. In contrast, we found that using human population density as a proxy for the frequency of transport events decreases models' performance and might thus not be as appropriate as previously thought. Finally, by differentiating road networks into sub-networks, we show that national and regional roads are more important than smaller roads for explaining spread patterns. Overall, our results demonstrate that the topology of transport networks can strongly bias regional invasion patterns and highlight the importance of better incorporating it into future invasion models. The mechanistic modelling approach developed in this study should help invasion scientists explore how human-mediated dispersal and topography shape invasion dynamics in landscapes. Ultimately, our approach could be combined with demographic, natural dispersal and environmental suitability models to refine spread scenarios and improve invasive species monitoring and management at regional to national scales.Keywords: biological invasions, human-mediated dispersal, road network, secondary spread, spatially explicit model, stochastic jump model},

This study focuses on the banded mystery snail, Callinina georgiana, an invasive species in the Adirondack region of northern New York, an important section of the New York Great Lakes Basin. This project aims to explore the genetic connectivity of C. georgiana within its invasive range using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Sampling was conducted in the Raquette River and adjacent waterways, with a total of 229 snails collected from 16 distinct populations distributed across eight different waterbodies. Also included were two populations from the species native range in the southern United States. DNA was extracted, and a 710 bp fragment of the mtDNA marker COI and a 351 bp fragment of nuclear marker Histone3 (H3) were amplified. Population genetic analyses including haplotype patterning, AMOVA and genetic diversity estimates, neutrality tests and tests for isolation by distance (IBD) were performed to assess connectivity patterns. Results showed moderate to high levels of genetic admixture within the invasive range as indicated by the lack of geographic patterning of haplotypes and low to moderate levels of genetic differentiation across multiple sites. Demographic analyses combined with high numbers of private haplotypes indicate population expansion. Interestingly, a case of mitonuclear discordance was detected for native and invasive populations as evident by incongruent haplotype patterns for the COI and H3 markers. Callinina georgiana exhibits a high level of genetic connectivity in its invasive range. The presence of dams does not significantly affect gene flow, indicating that anthropogenic activities, such as boat traffic might be key in dispersing the snails across this fragmented freshwater system. This study offers new insights into the dispersal and genetic structure of an invasive freshwater snail. It highlights the importance of considering anthropogenic factors when confronting complex patterns of genetic diversity. The findings are significant for biodiversity conservation and provide a basis for developing strategies to manage and contain the spread of AIS like C. georgiana, especially in regions with high human activity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

As previous investigations have related the index only to the Secchi disc transparency, the aim of this study was to compare the Index to a set of water quality parameters and trophic state indices. Two sandpit lakes with contrasting characteristics were selected as model lakes for the study. A total of 57 samples were collected simultaneously with the physicochemical water quality parameters between 2016 and 2020. Carlson’s trophic state indices were used to assess the trophic state of the lakes. Pearson correlation coefficient and Principal Component Analysis were used to assess the observed correlations between the measured parameters and to distinguish what factors regulate zooplankton community structure. Overall, 86 zooplankton taxa were identified. RCC Index ranged from 2 in the small sandpit lake to 87 in the big sandpit lake. A highly significant negative correlation was found between the RCC Index and the values of TP and COD. The results complement the arguments for the inclusion of zooplankton as a BQE for the assessment of the status of lakes.},

The temporal and spatial extent of anoxia experienced a step change increase coincident with the invasion, and anoxic factor increased by 11 d. Post-invasion, anoxia established more quickly following spring stratification, driven by an increase in phytoplankton biomass. A shift in spring phytoplankton phenology encompassed both abundance and community composition. Diatoms (Bacillaryophyta) drove the increase in spring phytoplankton biomass, but not all phytoplankton community members increased, shifting the community composition. We infer that increased phytoplankton biomass increased labile organic matter and drove hypolimnetic oxygen consumption.

However, MAR creates an important pathway for microplastics (particle size {\textless} 5 mm) to enter groundwater. To explore the clogging potential of microplastics in aquifer media, a series of laboratory-scale column experiments were conducted in this study. The hydraulic conductivity of porous media and deposition amount of microplastics were investigated under different experimental conditions. In our study, most of the microplastics were intercepted in the sand column's surface layer. The difference of particle size in porous media greatly influence the clogging development. The hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer media decreased as the microplastic particle size decreased. When the particle size of microplastic was larger than 300 mm, most of the microplastics deposits on the surface of the porous media, forming a "microplastic accumulation layer". Microplastics are affected by particle size, flow shear stress and preferential flow during migration. The migration ability of microplastics increased significantly with the increase of hydraulic head difference and decreased with the increase of sand column depth. The bacteria microorganisms are projected to be a new biological control strategy in conjunction with MAR. The study of clogging risk of microplastics particles in porous media during 2 artificial recharge provides novel and unique insights for the management and control of microplastic pollution in groundwater systems.},

In particular terrestrial plants have been the subject of less attention. Here we address the possibility to represent plant biodiversity from airborne environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling and metabarcoding. We collected air using a biological air sampler in the Botanical Garden of Montpellier (France) and compared the list of revealed plant species to the botanical inventory of the Garden. Ninety-two plant species could be detected from three sampling points across the 4,6 ha of the Garden, after one hour sampling allowing to filter 9 m3 of air. We recorded the plants carrying flowers at the time of the experiment, which allowed us to estimate that plants flowering at the time of the sampling could be detected 10 times more easily than plants that were not, given the number of plants carrying flowers. However, flowering is far from being required as a vast majority of plants still was detected without flowering. We also show that not all species orders are detected with the same probability, tree species being better represented in the sample than herbal plants, given the number of trees present in the garden. Finally using diagnostic species, present only once in the garden, we estimate that the maximum sampling distance allowed by the biological air sampler is at least 110 m. Our study underlines that air sampling is a promising method for monitoring terrestrial plant biodiversity and highlights the parameters that should be adjusted to optimize the approach.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The scyphozoan Cassiopea xamachana is an emerging cnidarian model system for studying regeneration, animal-algae symbiotic relationships, and various aspects of evolutionary biology including the early emergence of animal nervous systems.Cassiopea has a life cycle similar to other scyphozoans, which includes the alternation between a sessile, asexual form (polyp) and a sexually reproducing stage, the medusa.The transition between the two forms is called strobilation, where the polyp releases a miniature medusa, the iconic ephyra, that subsequently develops into the adult medusa. Common scyphozoan life cycle stages include a sessile polyp, free swimming ephyra larva, medusa, and sexually produced planula larvae. In addition, Cassiopea polyps may reproduce asexually by budding off free-swimming so-called planuloid buds. While the development of planuloid buds and polyps has been studied in some detail, little is known about the ontogeny of the sexually produced planula larva. Using immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy, we examined neuromuscular development during metamorphosis of the planula larva into the juvenile polyp in C. xamachana. For this purpose, we used α-tyrosinated-tubulin, FMRFamide and serotonin-like immunoreactivity together with phalloidin labeling. Our results show a planular nervous system that consists of a basiectodermal neural plexus with mostly longitudinal oriented neurites. This neural meshwork is connected to sensory neurons in the superficial stratum of the ectoderm, which are exclusively localized in the aboral half of the larva. During settlement, this aborally concentrated nervous system of the planula is replaced completely by the orally concentrated nervous system of the polyp.Mature Adult polyps show an extensive nerve net with a loose concentration around the oral disc. These findings are consistent with data from other scyphozoans and most likely constitute a conserved feature of scyphozoan discomedusae. Taken together, the data currently available suggest an aborally concentrated nervous system including sensory cells as part of the neural ground pattern of cnidarian planula larvae. The reorganization of the nervous system from anterior to posterior in planula-to-polyp metamorphosis most likely also constitutes an ancestral trait in cnidarian evolution.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a growing awareness of the critical role that maritime transport plays in global sustainability, given its significant environmental, economic, and social impacts. Central to this concern is the management of ballast water, which, if not properly treated, can lead to the introduction of invasive species, biodiversity loss, and substantial economic and health repercussions. Traditional risk assessment models often fail to capture the complex uncertainties inherent in environmental risks associated with ballast water. This study introduces an innovative fuzzy logic-based risk assessment model designed to enhance decision-making processes in maritime operations by accurately assessing and mitigating the environmental risks of ballast water discharge. The model, structured using three fuzzy systems, integrates human reasoning with mathematical precision, providing an effective tool for sustainable maritime practices. The integrated fuzzy system employs 18 variables as inputs and yields three outputs (ballasting, ballast exchange, and de-ballasting risk). To evaluate the performance of the developed system, various data sets are used and tested through the MATLAB Fuzzy Toolbox. By aligning maritime operations with sustainability principles, this research contributes to the preservation of marine ecosystems, supports the economic stability of marine-dependent industries, and safeguards public health, underscoring the interconnectivity of maritime transport management with overarching sustainability objectives.},

Most research efforts have focused on direct or indirect effects on human populations, with a view to gain easy accurate detection and quantification methods, mainly in planktic communities, but with increasing interest shown in benthos. However, cyanobacteria have played a fundamental role from the very beginning in both the development of our planet’s biodiversity and the construction of new habitats. These organisms have colonized almost every possible planktic or benthic environment on earth, including the most extreme ones, and display a vast number of adaptations. All this explains why they are the most important or the only phototrophs in some habitats. The negative effects of cyanotoxins on macroinvertebrates have been demonstrated, but usually under conditions that are far from natural, and on forms of exposure, toxin concentration, or composition. The cohabitation of cyanobacteria with most invertebrate groups is long-standing and has probably contributed to the development of detoxification means, which would explain the survival of some species inside cyanobacteria colonies. This review focuses on benthic cyanobacteria, their capacity to produce several types of toxins, and their relationships with benthic macroinvertebrates beyond toxicity.},

	abstract = {Microcystins (MCs), natural hepatotoxic compounds produced by cyanobacteria, pose significant risks to water quality, ecosystem stability, and the well-being of animals, plants, and humans when present in elevated concentrations. The escalating contamination of irrigation water with MCs presents a growing threat to terrestrial plants. The customary practice of irrigating crops from local water sources, including lakes and ponds hosting cyanobacterial blooms, serves as a primary conduit for transferring these toxins. Due to their high chemical stability and low molecular weight, MCs have the potential to accumulate in various parts of plants, thereby increasing health hazards for consumers of agricultural products, which serve as the foundation of the Earth’s food chain. MCs can bioaccumulate, migrate, potentially biodegrade, and pose health hazards to humans within terrestrial food systems. This study highlights that MCs from irrigation water reservoirs can bioaccumulate and come into contact with plants, transferring into the food chain. Additionally, it investigates the natural mechanisms that organisms employ for conjugation and the microbial processes involved in MC degradation. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the role of MCs in the terrestrial food chain and to elucidate the specific health risks associated with consuming crops irrigated with water contaminated with these toxins, further research is necessary.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the dietary immunomodulatory effects of Terminalia arjuna bark powder (TABP) in Labeo rohita, a freshwater fish model. Four iso-nitrogenous and iso-caloric diets containing graded levels of TABP (0, 1, 10, and 15 g/kg were fed to fish for 90 days, followed by a 10 day challenge with pathogenic bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila and Edwardsiella tarda. An integrated biomarker response (IBR) approach assessed the impact of TABP on hematological, adaptive, and humoral immune parameters, along with liver histomorphology. Dietary TABP at 10 g/kg significantly enhanced (p {\textless} 0.05) hematological indices (hemoglobin, red blood cell count, hematocrit), specific immune parameters (lysosomal enzyme activity, phagocytosis, respiratory burst), and non-specific immune parameters (serum lysozyme, alternative complement activity), and exhibited improvements in liver architecture consistent with the enhanced immune response. Broken line regression analysis showed 11.5 g/kg to be an optimum dose. However, at 15 g/kg, a compromised trend was observed in some parameters. These findings suggest an optimal dosage range for TABP’s immunomodulatory effects. The study highlights the potential of TABP as a natural immunomodulator in fish aquaculture. The improved immune response and concomitant liver health observed in Labeo rohita opens avenues for further research on TABP’s applicability in animal health, using fish as a model organism. Additionally, the IBR approach proved effective in evaluating TABP’s immunomodulatory properties, paving the way for similar studies on other natural products in aquaculture.},

	abstract = {Microorganisms encode proteins that function in the transformations of useful and harmful nitrogenous compounds in the global nitrogen cycle. The major transformations in the nitrogen cycle are nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, anaerobic ammonium oxidation, and ammonification. The focus of this report is the complex biogeochemical process of denitrification, which, in the complete form, consists of a series of four enzyme-catalyzed reduction reactions that transforms nitrate to nitrogen gas. Denitrification is a microbial strain-level ecological trait (characteristic), and denitrification potential (functional performance) can be inferred from trait rules that rely on the presence or absence of genes for denitrifying enzymes in microbial genomes. Despite the global significance of denitrification and associated large-scale genomic and scholarly data sources, there is lack of datasets and interactive computational tools for investigating microbial genomes according to denitrification trait rules. Therefore, our goal is to categorize archaeal and bacterial genomes by denitrification potential based on denitrification traits defined by rules of enzyme involvement in the denitrification reduction steps. We report the integration of datasets on genome, taxonomic lineage, ecosystem, and denitrifying enzymes to provide data investigations context for the denitrification potential of microbial strains. We constructed an ecosystem and taxonomic annotated denitrification potential dataset of 62,624 microbial genomes (866 archaea and 61,758 bacteria) that encode at least one of the twelve denitrifying enzymes in the four-step canonical denitrification pathway. Our four-digit binary-coding scheme categorized the microbial genomes to one of sixteen denitrification traits including complete denitrification traits assigned to 3280 genomes from 260 bacteria genera. The bacterial strains with complete denitrification potential pattern included Arcobacteraceae strains isolated or detected in diverse ecosystems including aquatic, human, plant, and Mollusca (shellfish). The dataset on microbial denitrification potential and associated interactive data investigations tools can serve as research resources for understanding the biochemical, molecular, and physiological aspects of microbial denitrification, among others. The microbial denitrification data resources produced in our research can also be useful for identifying microbial strains for synthetic denitrifying communities.},

	abstract = {Climate change and associated shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns have become an increasing concern as drivers of ongoing biodiversity loss. The Mediterranean region is particularly vulnerable, being both a biodiversity hotspot and a region very prone to desertification. Freshwater mussels are amongst the most threatened invertebrate taxa worldwide. Unio tumidiformis is an endemic and endangered species restricted to the southern Iberian Peninsula, living in temporary Mediterranean-type streams. Freshwater mussels need a fish host for successful larval transformation, meaning U. tumidiformis must belong to the genus Squalius. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the vulnerability of U. tumidiformis to climate change, by studying its population genetics and evolutionary history, its current and future habitat suitability, and that of its hosts. Genetic population structure and diversity were assessed using Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms through Genotyping by Sequencing and used to infer species evolutionary history. The species potential distribution was modeled using an ensemble forecasting approach, and future shifts in habitat suitability were assessed with the projected climate data layers from Worldclim. Most populations showed extreme genetic differentiation (Fst up to 0.745), even from close neighboring ones. Upper Guadiana populations were more diverse and less differentiated. We hypothesize that U. tumidiformis originated in Upper Guadiana and followed the same colonization routes as their hosts with numerous founder effects and bottlenecks. Our results also predicted a reduction of 99\% of climatically suitable areas for U. tumidiformis in the Iberian Peninsula until 2040. For the fish hosts, a maximum 42\% reduction in suitable areas was estimated throughout the century, with remaining adequate habitats in the north. Our results suggest that difficult conservation options are necessary, prioritizing the preservation of populations, translocations to the northern area of its historical range and stream engineering to increase resilience to droughts.},

The bio-accumulation of Sr and its impacts, as well as any possible hidden mechanisms, were evaluated based on the physiological alterations of the sentinel blue mussel Mytilus edulis. The mussels were exposed to a series of stress-inducing concentrations, with the highest solubility being 0.2 g/L. No acute lethality was observed during the experiment, but sublethal damage was evident. Sr accumulated in a tissue-specific way, and hemolymph was the target, with the highest accumulating concentration being 64.46 µg/g wet weight (ww). At the molecular level, increases in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) and changes in ROS components (H2O2, O2−, and -OH) and antioxidant system activity indicated that the redox equilibrium state in hemocytes was disturbed. Furthermore, the rise in the hemocyte micronucleus (MN) rate (4‰ in the high-concentration group) implied DNA damage. At the cellular level, the structures of hemocytes were damaged, especially with respect to lysosomes, which play a crucial role in phagocytosis. Lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) was also affected, and both acid phosphatase (ACP) and alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activities were reduced, resulting in a significant decline in phagocytosis. The hemolymph population structure at the organ level was disturbed, with large changes in hemocyte number and mortality rate, along with changes in component ratios. These toxic effects were evaluated by employing the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework. The results suggested that the disruption of intracellular redox homeostasis is a possible explanation for Sr-induced toxicity in M. edulis.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryThe apple snail is one of the most dangerous invasive species in freshwater environments. Using molecular and morphological tools, we re-describe an echinostomatid digenean parasitizing snails from two sites in the Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. The two stages found (i.e., rediae and metacercariae) demonstrate that the apple snail acts as the first and second intermediate host in its life cycle. The prevalence of the parasite was higher at one of the sampling sites, probably because the birds bearing the adult stage are more abundant in that area. A histological study showed that this parasite quickly invades multiple organs of the snail, which is different from most digenean infections, which only infect the gonad and digestive glands. Heavy deterioration of female and male reproductive structures associated with the presence of the parasite was also observed, which indicates castration.AbstractPomacea canaliculata is one of the most dangerous invasive species. Morphological and molecular analyses have revealed that a digenean species belonging to the family Echinostomatidae parasitizes this snail at two sites in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, South America. Molecular results confirmed that the species belongs to a genus closely related to Patagifer. Analysis of the 28S rDNA showed that the sequences of the rediae and metacercariae are identical, indicating that the apple snail acts as the first and second intermediate host. The cercariae may encyst as metacercaria inside the redia and also emerge and re-infect the same snail or another snail. The prevalence of digeneans was higher in one of the sampling locations (15.1\% vs. 0.72\%), probably because the bird species that acts as the definitive host is more abundant in that area. Histopathological examination showed that the parasite quickly invades multiple host organs (gills, intestines, albumen gland, lung, kidney, and mantle border) besides the gonad and digestive gland, as is usual in digeneans. In addition, the partial or total castration of snails was observed in cases of moderate and high infection intensity. In males, there was loss of integrity in testicular tubules, while in females, the replacement of ovarian tissue by rediae was found.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryProcambarus clarkii is typically viewed as a predator rather than prey, due to its strong anti-predatory capabilities. However, during its juvenile stage, it remains vulnerable to predators. Nonetheless, complex outdoor habitats can offer some protection. By examining the effects of three different types of shelters with various coverages and combinations on the predation rhythm, behavior, and efficiency of Silurus asotus on juvenile Procambarus clarkii, we found that the presence and complexity of shelters in the environment have a limited impact on the predatory activities of Silurus asotus. Among the shelter types, PVC pipes offered the best protection, followed by stone, with water grass providing the least protection. Furthermore, the protective effect of shelters increased with coverage rate. Therefore, we suggest that the type and abundance of shelters significantly influence the predation rhythm and behavior of Silurus asotus on Procambarus clarkii in outdoor environments.AbstractProcambarus clarkii is adept at using natural shelters and caves to evade attacks from predators. However, the concealment abilities and mechanisms of P. clarkii for different types of shelters under predation pressure have not yet been reported. In this study, laboratory experiments were carried out to determine the effects of different coverages (25\%, 50\%, and 75\%) and different combinations (I–VII) of three types of shelters (PVC pipes, water grass, and stone) on the predation rhythm, behavior, and abilities of Silurus asotus on P. clarkii. The results indicated that the predation of S. asotus on P. clarkii exhibited significant rhythmicity under shelter conditions, excluding PVC pipes, 75\% stone, and combination VI. Among the three types of shelters, PVC pipes provided the strongest concealment, followed by stone and water grass. With the increase in shelter coverage, the anti-predation ability of P. clarkii continued to increase, and the optimal shade rate for water grass was 50\%. In the different shelter combinations, the environmental complexity had little effect on the predation activity of S. asotus on P. clarkii. These findings demonstrated that the type and abundance of shelters in the wild environment can affect the predation rhythm and activities of S. asotus on P. clarkii.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a three-dimensional continuous time dynamical system of three species, two of which are competing preys and one is a predator. We also assume that during predation, the members of both teams of preys help each other and the rate of predation of both teams is different. The interaction between prey and predator is assumed to be governed by a Holling type II functional response and discrete type gestation delay of the predator for consumption of the prey. In this work, we establish the local asymptotic stability of various equilibrium points to understand the dynamics of the model system. Different conditions for the coexistence of equilibrium solutions are discussed. Persistence, permanence of the system, and global stability of the positive interior equilibrium solution are discussed by constructing suitable Lyapunov functions when the gestation delay is zero, and there is no periodic orbit within the interior of the first quadrant of state space around the interior equilibrium. As we introduced time delay due to the gestation of the predator, we also discuss the stability of the delayed model. It is observed that the existence of stability switching occurs around the interior equilibrium point as the gestation delay increases through a certain critical threshold. Here, a phenomenon of Hopf bifurcation occurs, and a stable limit cycle corresponding to the periodic solution of the system is also observed. This study reveals that the delay is taken as a bifurcation parameter and also plays a significant role for the stability of the proposed model. Computer simulations of numerical examples are given to explain our proposed model. We have also addressed critically the biological implications of our analytical findings with proper numerical examples.},

New technologies like autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) collect tens of thousands of images per mission making image-based ground truthing particularly attractive. Two types of machine learning (ML) models, random forest (RF) and deep neural network (DNN), were tested to determine whether ML models could serve as an accurate substitute for manual classification of AUV images for substrate type interpretation. RF models were trained to predict substrate class as a function of texture, edge, and intensity metrics (i.e., features) calculated for each image. Models were tested using a manually classified image dataset with 9-, 6-, and 2-class schemes based on the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard (CMECS). Results suggest that both RF and DNN models achieve comparable accuracies, with the 9-class models being least accurate ({\textasciitilde}73–78\%) and the 2-class models being the most accurate ({\textasciitilde}95–96\%). However, the DNN models were more efficient to train and apply because they did not require feature estimation before training or classification. Integrating ML models into benthic habitat mapping process can improve our ability to efficiently and accurately ground-truth large areas of benthic habitat using AUV or similar images.},

The water-purification effects of two hierarchical configuration modes of V. natans-Bellamya aeruginosa and V. natans-B. aeruginosa-Hyriopsis cumingii were studied. Results show that a V. natans and B. aeruginosa configuration ratio of 15:2 stabilizes water quality at Grade IV (TN ≤ 1.5 mg/L, TP ≤ 0.3 mg/L), and increasing B. aeruginosa density significantly reduces total phosphorus. The V. natans, B. aeruginosa, and H. cumingii configuration at 15:2:10 stabilizes water at Grade III (TN ≤ 1.0 mg/L, TP ≤ 0.2 mg/L), with a positive correlation between H. cumingii density and chlorophyll-a removal. Furthermore, the filtration and biocycling actions of B. aeruginosa (snails) and H. cumingii (mussels) significantly reduce levels of Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Phosphorus (TP), and Ammonium (NH4+-N) in water, thus enhancing the self-purification capacity of the water bodies. However, the bioturbation effect of H. cumingii can temporarily increase phosphorus release from sediments, leading to a short-term rise in TP concentration in the water. Overall, the study concludes that multitrophic level ecosystems are effective in purifying water quality and offer significant ecological restoration benefits. This research provides crucial data support for future construction and ecological restoration projects involving multitrophic level approaches in China’s rivers and lakes.},

To address this data gap, water quality data for lakes and rivers in Canada and the continental USA were compiled and used to generate high-resolution (10 × 10 km) interpolated raster layers, after comparing multiple spatial interpolation approaches. This is the first time that such data have been made available at this scale and resolution, providing a valuable resource for research, including projects evaluating risks from environmental change, pollution, and invasive species.

Copper (Cu) is one of the most spread heavy metals in water, and can severely affect primary producers at high doses. Here we show a novel imaging test to assay the dose-dependent effects of Cu on live microalgae identifying stress conditions when they are still capable of sustaining a positive growth. The method relies on Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM), capable to image large field of view in label-free phase-contrast mode attaining submicron lateral resolution. We uniquely combine FPM with a new multi-scale analysis method based on fractal geometry. The system is able to provide ensemble measurements of thousands of diatoms in the liquid sample simultaneously, while ensuring at same time single-cell imaging and analysis for each diatom. Through new image descriptors, we demonstrate that fractal analysis is suitable for handling the complexity and informative power of such multiscale FPM modality. We successfully tested this new approach by measuring how different concentrations of Cu impact on Skeletonema pseudocostatum diatom populations isolated from the Sarno River mouth.},

While much is known about the accumulation and transformation of arsenic in marine organisms, little is known regarding these processes in freshwater aquatic species. In this study, the acute toxicity and toxicological effects of inorganic arsenic on four freshwater organisms (Cyprinus carpio, Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, Pseudorasbora parva, Eriocheir sinensis) commonly found in rice-fish farming systems were investigated. The organisms exhibited different levels of sensitivity to inorganic arsenic, with crustaceans being more sensitive than fish. Fish were found to be more tolerant to As(V) than As(III). The study also investigated the accumulation, transformation, and release of inorganic arsenic in crucian carp, an omnivorous species with high environmental tolerance. The fish accumulated As(III) rapidly in various tissues, and were able to transport it to other tissues through gills, intestines, and skin. The accumulated As(III) was converted into less toxic forms, such as monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), via methylation. The fish also converted As(III) into arsenate (AsV) via enzymatic and oxidative reactions. After the transferal to clean water, the forms of arsenic in the various tissues decreased rapidly, but the rates of excretion of the four forms of arsenic were not the same among the different tissues. Our results suggest that crucian carp can reduce the environmental toxicity of As(III) at certain concentrations by transforming it into less toxic forms within their bodies.},

Parallel field and screenhouse-potted soil experiments were performed to assess the efficacy with which the test plants phytoaccumulate DDT from the soil. In the screenhouse experiment, treatments were laid out following a split-plot arrangement in a completely randomized design (CRD), with the main plots comprising two DDT concentration levels–low (417 mg kg−1) or high (2308 mg kg−1)—and the plant species Cucurbita pepo, Lagenaria siceraria, Ipomoea batatus, Sesamum indicum and Eleusine coracana were considered as subplots. A field experiment with the same crop species as the treatments was laid out in a randomized complete block design, and both experiments were performed in triplicate. In addition to determining the concentration of persistent organic pesticides in the soil profile, parameters such as the total DDT uptake by plants, shoot weight and shoot height were monitored in both potted soil and open field experiments. Overall, calabash and sweet potato exhibited the highest (4.63 mg kg−1) and second highest (3.45 mg kg−1) DDT concentrations from the high residual DDT potted soil experiment. A similar trend was observed when the two plants were grown in low DDT soil. Sweet potato recorded the highest shoot height and weight in the potted soil experiments, indicating that increasing amounts of DDT had a minimal effect on the plant’s growth. Although sweet potato outperformed calabash in the amounts of DDT concentration in the shoots under open field experiments, the uptake of DDT by calabash was the second highest. Calabash—a wild non-edible plant in Tanzania—presents a potential phytoremediation alternative to edible and much studied pumpkin.},

	abstract = {In recent years, micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) have represented an emerging threat for the aquatic environment due to their persistence and widespread distribution. Indeed, their small size and increased surface area lead to a high biological reactivity, which can be crucial for the health status of biota. To date, several studies have investigated lethal and sublethal endpoints of MNPs, while one of the main challenges is to understand their mechanisms of toxicity in a comprehensive manner. With this aim, the field of aquatic ecotoxicology can now benefit from the -omics approaches. This review focuses on the recent advances related to the use of transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to deeply investigate the molecular and biochemical responses of aquatic organisms, both fishes and aquatic invertebrates, to pristine polystyrene (PS) MNPs. The literature reviewed revealed that transcriptomics and metabolomics are the most frequently used -omic approaches. Overall, the studies taken into consideration shed light on the events triggered by PS MNPs at molecular and cellular levels, identifying as mechanisms of toxicity the pathways involved in oxidative stress, energy metabolism, immune response, and the nervous system. Future studies should therefore focus on the use and integration of multi-omics approaches for a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in MNPs toxicity.},

	abstract = {Global warming is causing poleward expansion of species ranges. Temperate seas, in particular, are undergoing a process known as ‘tropicalisation’, i.e., the combination of sea-water warming and establishment of southern species. The Ligurian Sea is one of the coldest sectors of the Mediterranean and has thus been characterized by a dearth of warm-temperate species and a comparative abundance of cold-temperate species. This paper uses a time series of sea surface temperature (SST) and new records of thermophilic fish species to reconsider the biogeography of the Ligurian Sea. SST has risen by about 0.7 °C on average between 1948 and 2023, but two phases may be distinguished: a cool one (ended in the mid-1980s) and a warm one (still ongoing); the latter phase shows alternating periods of rapid warming and comparatively stationary temperature. The arrival of thermophilic species coincided with the periods of rapid warming; some of these species were established in the subsequent stationary periods. Heatwaves and climate-related diseases associated with the periods of rapid warming have caused mass mortalities of autochthonous species. Our knowledge on the biogeography of the Ligurian Sea was established during the cool phase; the present situation, however, calls for re-defining the chorological spectrum of the Ligurian Sea biota.},

Chromosome complements of 2n = 7/8 (male/female), n = 1m + 2sm + 1a (X), and CMA3-positive bands in all chromosomes were found in all three populations. FISH revealed one 18S rDNA locus on the X chromosome and one locus of H3 histone genes on the first chromosome pair. At the intraspecific level, the populations differed in the presence of supernumerary B chromosomes, which were found in all specimens from Zemplínska Šírava and in 89.4\% of specimens from the Laborec River, but not at the reference site. The first two sites are considered to be water bodies with high toxin contamination. Based on this fact, we assume an increased frequency of chromosome breaks leading to the formation of DNA fragments that have the potential to form B chromosomes. The present results add to the very limited data on the organization of multigene families in the genome of Acanthocephala and suggest a possible causal link between water pollution and the occurrence of B chromosomes in fish parasites.},

This study compared the intestinal microbiota, metabolome, and key digestive enzymes of these two competing mussels to elucidate their differences from intestinal microbiota and metabolic points. The analysis revealed differences in the abundance of Bacteroidota related to carbohydrate degradation, as well as enriched metabolites and higher carbohydrase activities in M. strigata compared to P. viridis. These findings suggested that these differences might contribute to the adaptation of M. strigata to its new environment, providing valuable insights into the competition between these species for food resources.AbstractBiological invasion is a primary direct driver of biodiversity loss. Recently, owing to exploitation competition with an invasive mussel, Mytella strigata (Hanley, 1843), there has been a drastic decrease in the population of native Perna viridis (Linnaeus, 1758) in several western Pacific regions. In the present study, intestinal microbiota, metabolome, and key digestive enzyme activities were compared between the two competing mussels, M. strigata and P. viridis, to elucidate the differences in intestinal microbiota and metabolic points. We observed that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidota were the three predominant bacterial phyla in the two species. The relative abundance of Bacteroidota related to carbohydrate-degrading ability was significantly higher in M. strigata than in P. viridis. Compared to P. viridis, different metabolites including maltose and trehalose were enriched in M. strigata. Lastly, higher carbohydrases activities of alpha-amylase, cellulase, and xylanase were observed in M. strigata than in P. viridis. These differences might play an important role in the adaptation process of M. strigata to the new environment. This study provides important basic knowledge for investigating the competition between M. strigata and P. viridis in terms of food resources utilization.},

The highest number of 32.85 ± 27.98 MPs per mussel digestive gland was found in the mussels sampled from the ACI marina Rovinj (Croatia). The predominant MPs found in the mussel digestive glands at all investigated locations belonged to the smallest analyzed category (5–10 μm in size) and exhibited spherical and fragment shapes. The most abundant MPs found in mussels by color were white particles. MPs were found in both wild and farmed mussels and, hence, the results point out that the abundance of microplastic pollution is omnipresent along the coastal waters of the northern Adriatic Sea.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryPerumytilus purpuratus is a mussel species that is broadly distributed along the latitudinal gradient from the Southern Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. Along its distribution, P. purpuratus has been historically considered as one species. However, in the last decade, evidence has supported the hypothesis of two geographically divergent lineages. Within this context, we explore the evolutionary history of this inter-oceanic mussel, linking both sperm acrosome variability and molecular analyses of males at the geographic macroscale. In general, our results were in agreement with the genetic divergence that was previously reported, and showing two north and south lineage. Furthermore, our comprehensive sampling effort enabled us to precisely determine both the latitudinal positions of morpho-genetic break, which was identified at 37° S on the Pacific coast, and a probable hybridization zone at 38° S. In addition, we found new southern sperm variants, longer than previously reported. Overall, our results support the hypothesis of historical events and postglacial recolonization as causal phenomena for the observed divergences. Finally, we consider that, despite uncertainties in the taxonomy of P. purpuratus, the morpho-genetic divergence between the north and south P. purpuratus lineages indicates that they do not constitute the same Evolutionary Significant Unit and, therefore, they should be considered as separate entities.AbstractIn recent years, advances in analyses of the sperm morphology and genetics of Perumytilus purpuratus have allowed to two evolutionary scenarios for this mussel to be suggested: (1) the scenario of cryptic species and (2) the scenario of incipient or in progress speciation. For a better understanding of the evolutionary history of P. purpuratus, we performed extensive sampling along a latitudinal gradient of ca. 7180 km of coastline—from the Southern Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean—and we delved deeper into the sperm morphology of P. purpuratus, exploring its association with the phylogeny and population genetics to determine whether the variability in sperm traits between the northern and southern regions was a signal of cryptic or incipient species. Overall, our results showed that sperm sizes were strongly correlated with the genetic structure in males of P. purpuratus. We identified at 37° S on the Pacific coast a coincident break of both sperm size and genetic disruption that can be explained by historical events and postglacial recolonization as causal phenomena for the observed divergences. Furthermore, evidence of genetic admixture between lineages was found at 38° S, suggesting the presence of an introgressive hybridization zone and incomplete reproductive isolation in an in fraganti or incipient speciation process.},

	abstract = {Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) can have a positive impact on flora and fauna by limiting direct human impact in these areas. Estuaries were added to the MPA framework to protect nursery habitat for recreationally and commercially important fish species. This study evaluates how protection status and inlet status structure fish communities, with a focus on nursery provision as well as evaluates how capture method and sampling effort can be combined into a monitoring framework to target a wide range of species and functional groups. Data from seines and baited remote underwater videos indicate that there are significant differences between estuary types (both protected and non-protected areas and temporarily closed and permanently open). While MPAs did differ from non-MPAs, the inlet status of protected and non-protected areas was potentially a more important driver of fish community structure as the frequency of an inlets closure influenced important abiotic variables such as dissolved oxygen, water temperature and salinity. Capture methods used in this study significantly differed from each other in the fish and guilds that they targeted. This reinforces the importance of method selection when designing a monitoring framework and assessing community compositions between systems. Seines targeted the widest range of fish but were most effective with smaller species, while angler observations in Batiquitos Lagoon Carlsbad California were most effective at targeting larger roving fish species. Fishing pressure did not appear to have a negative impact on nursery function in Batiquitos Lagoon, with some of the most diverse communities seen in this study. Overall, results indicate that capture methods are important, as communities in perennially open systems and temporarily closed systems are significantly different from each other and utilizing a diverse range of capture methods can help to properly assess these communities.},

However, improvements in ease of use and portability could increase the utility of eDNA methods, leading to more widespread application, including expanding its role in management decision-making processes. We describe the development of an eDNA detection assay for delta smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus), an endangered fish in the San Francisco Estuary, using SHERLOCK (Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter Unlocking). SHERLOCK is a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based diagnostic tool with the ability to detect species-specific genetic variants, making it ideal for genetic-based taxonomic identification of any organism. Because of its high sensitivity and specificity, SHERLOCK is adaptable to eDNA detection in water samples. Here, we describe adaptation of a delta smelt SHERLOCK assay for use with estuarine water eDNA samples. This version of the assay exhibits increased sensitivity compared to the original delta smelt SHERLOCK protocol (new limit of detection approximately three copies per reaction compared to {\textasciitilde}300 in original assay) and successfully detected delta smelt eDNA in both experimental and natural contexts. Overall, our results demonstrate that SHERLOCK eDNA detection offers managers an alternative, isothermal methodology, and highlights some challenges for detection of rare, endangered species at low abundance.},

However, instances of inadequate communication from the scientific community about confidence levels, knowledge gaps, reliability, and appropriate parameters of eDNA-based methods have hindered their uptake in environmental monitoring programs and, in some cases, has created misperceptions or doubts in the management community. To help remedy this situation, scientists convened a session at the Second National Marine eDNA Workshop to discuss strategies for improving communications with managers. These include articulating the readiness of different eDNA applications, highlighting the strengths and limitations of eDNA tools for various applications or use cases, communicating uncertainties associated with specified uses transparently, and avoiding the exaggeration of exploratory and preliminary findings. Several key messages regarding implementation, limitations, and relationship to existing methods were prioritized. To be inclusive of the diverse managers, practitioners, and researchers, we and the other workshop participants propose the development of communication workflow plans, using RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) charts to clarify the roles of all pertinent individuals and parties and to minimize the chance for miscommunications. We also propose developing decision support tools such as Structured Decision-Making (SDM) to help balance the benefits of eDNA sampling with the inherent uncertainty, and developing an eDNA readiness scale to articulate the technological readiness of eDNA approaches for specific applications. These strategies will increase clarity and consistency regarding our understanding of the utility of eDNA-based methods, improve transparency, foster a common vision for confidently applying eDNA approaches, and enhance their benefit to the monitoring and assessment community.},

Foram realizadas 41 estações de coleta em sete departamentos do Paraguai. A busca pelos bivalves foi feita utilizando pés e mãos. Todos os pontos foram georreferenciados e algumas variáveis ambientais foram medidas. Os resultados indicam a presença de três espécies de bivalves invasores no Paraguai: Corbicula fluminea, C. largillierti e Limnoperna fortunei. O berbigão asiático Corbicula fluminea foi a espécie com a distribuição mais ampla, cobrindo os principais rios e tributários, em quatro ecoregiões de água doce do Paraguai. As outras duas espécies apresentaram uma distribuição mais restrita. Corbicula largillierti foi encontrado no Baixo rio Paraná, enquanto Limnoperna fortunei foi encontrado na calha principal do rio Paraguai e no Baixo rio Paraná. As espécies invasoras foram encontradas em três unidades de conservação e pode representar a ameaça para a pouco conhecida fauna de bivalves nativos do Paraguai. As espécies de bivalves invasores estão amplamente distribuídas no Paraguai. Medidas de mitigação são necessárias para evitar que estas espécies se dispersem ainda mais, provocando mais efeitos negativos sobre as espécies nativas.Alternate abstract:La Plata Basin is the second largest hydrographic system in South America but the most impacted by invasive species of molluscs in the continent. Paraguay is a land-surrounded South American country with scarce information about malacological fauna. To fill some of these gaps, a large field expedition was conducted to analyze the distribution of invasive freshwater bivalves in Paraguay. The field survey encompassed 41 sampling stations in seven Departments of Paraguay. The mussels were searched using bare hands and feet. All stations were georeferenced and some environmental parameters were measured. Results indicated the presence of three invasive species of freshwater bivalves in Paraguay: Corbicula fluminea, C. largillierti, and Limncperna fortunei. The Asiatic clam Corbicula fluminea was the most widespread invasive species, covering main rivers and small tributaries in the four freshwater ecoregions of Paraguay. The two remaining invasive species were more restricted. Corbicula largillierti were found at the lower section of the Paraná River, and Limncperna fortunei inhabits the main river canals of the Paraguay River and the lower section of the Paraná River. The invasive species were found in three protected areas of Paraguay and can represent a threat to the mostly unknown fauna of native mussels. The invasive bivalves are widespread in Paraguay. Mitigation measurements must be taken to avoid the spread of these species and more drawbacks over native fauna.},

Fatalities have been linked to neurotoxicosis from anatoxins, potent alkaloids produced by certain genera of filamentous cyanobacteria. After numerous reports of dog illnesses and deaths at a popular recreation site on Lady Bird Lake, Austin, Texas in late summer 2019, water and floating mat samples were collected from several sites along the reservoir. Water quality parameters were measured and mat samples were maintained for algal isolation and DNA identification. Samples were also analyzed for cyanobacterial toxins using LC-MS. Dihydroanatoxin-a was detected in mat materials from two of the four sites (0.6–133 ng/g wet weight) while water samples remained toxin-free over the course of the sampling period; no other cyanobacterial toxins were detected. DNA sequencing analysis of cyanobacterial isolates yielded a total of 11 genera, including Geitlerinema, Tyconema, Pseudanabaena, and Phormidium/Microcoleus, taxa known to produce anatoxins, including dihydroanatoxin, among other cyanotoxins. Analyses indicate that low daily upriver dam discharge, higher TP and NO3 concentrations, and day of the year were the main parameters associated with the presence of toxic floating cyanobacterial mats.},

This high-coverage genomic and transcriptomic information can be re-evaluated regardless of the original research subject. The database-deposited NGS data can offer valuable insights into the genomes of organelles, particularly for non-model organisms. Here, we developed an automated bioinformatics workflow called “OrgaMiner”, designed to unveil high-quality mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes by data mining the NCBI SRA database. OrgaMiner, a Python-based pipeline, automatically orchestrates various tools to extract, assemble, and annotate organelle genomes for non-model organisms without available organelle genome sequences but with data in the NCBI SRA. To test the usability and feasibility of the pipeline, “mollusca” was selected as a keyword, and 76 new mitochondrial genomes were de novo assembled and annotated automatically without writing one single code. The applicability of the pipeline can be expanded to identify organelles in diverse invertebrate, vertebrate, and plant species by simply specifying the taxonomic name. OrgaMiner provides an easy-to-use, end-to-end solution for biologists mainly working with taxonomy and population genetics.},

	abstract = {The teleost ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is an active transmembrane transporter that plays a pivotal role in facilitating the movement of both endogenous and xenobiotic substrates (moderately hydrophobic and amphipathic compounds) across cell membranes. P-gp exhibits substrate specificity often shared with other ABC transporters and solute carrier proteins, thereby ensuring the maintenance of chemical homeostasis within cells. These transporters are integral to chemical defense systems in fish, as they actively expel a wide range of substrates, primarily unmodified compounds, from cells. This transport process assists in preventing chemical absorption (e.g., intestine), safeguarding sensitive tissues (e.g., brain and gonads), and effectively excreting substances (e.g., liver and kidney). Upregulated P-gp export activity in aquatic animals results in the multi-xenobiotic resistance (MXR) phenotype that plays an essential protective role in survival in contaminated environments. Pollutants inhibiting P-gp are termed chemosensitizers and heighten fish sensitivity to toxic P-gp substrates. While the known intrinsic functions of P-gp in fish encompass steroid hormone and bile acid processing, relatively little attention has been given to endogenous substrates and inhibitors. Fish P-glycoprotein regulation is orchestrated by pivotal nuclear transcription factors, including pregnane X receptor (PXR) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). This comprehensive review provides profound insights into P-gp’s significance across diverse fish species, contributing to an enhanced understanding of fish physiology, evolution, and toxicology, and provides information with potential applications, such as environmental monitoring.},

The presence of nanoplastics has been found to have a detrimental impact on both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The present study examines the effect of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS NPs) on the DNA, erythrocytes, oxidative status and renal histology of catfish, in addition to the potential protective effects of Chlorella vulgaris bioremediation and selenium to hinder this effect. Six equal groups of fish were used as follows: Group 1 served as a control group and received water free from PS NPs; Group 2 was exposed to PS NPs at a concentration of 5 mg/L; Group 3 was exposed to PS NPs (5 mg/L) + selenium (1 mg/kg diet); Group 4 was exposed to PS NPs (5 mg/L) + C. vulgaris (25 g/kg diet); Group 5 was supplemented with C. vulgaris (25 g/kg diet); and Group 6 was supplemented with selenium (1 mg/kg diet). The exposure period was 30 days. The results indicated that PS NPs induced oxidative stress by significantly elevating malondialdehyde activities and slightly reducing antioxidant biomarkers, resulting in DNA damage, increased frequency of micronuclei, erythrocyte alterations, and numerous histopathological alterations in kidney tissue. Selenium and C. vulgaris significantly ameliorated the oxidative/antioxidant status, reducing DNA damage, micronucleus frequency, erythrocyte alterations, and improving the morphology of kidney tissue. Nevertheless, further research is needed for a profound understanding of the mechanism behind the toxicity of nano-microplatics in aquatic systems.},

	abstract = {Understanding the density-dependent impacts of an invasive predator is integral for predicting potential consequences for prey populations. Functional response experiments are used to assess the rate of prey consumption and a predator’s ability to search for and consume prey at different resource densities. However, results can be highly context-dependent, limiting their extrapolation to natural ecosystems. Here, we examined how simulated habitat complexity, through the addition of substrate in which prey can escape predation, affects the functional response of invasive European green crabs (Carcinus maenas) foraging on two different bivalve species. Green crabs feeding on varnish clams (Nuttallia obscurata) shifted from a Type II hyperbolic functional response in the absence of substrate to density-independent consumption when prey could bury. Green crabs ate few Japanese littleneck clams (Venerupis philippinarum) under all densities, such that no functional response curve of any type could be produced and their total consumption was always density independent. However, the probability of at least one Japanese littleneck clam being consumed increased significantly with initial clam density and crab claw size across all treatments. At mean crab claw size and compared to trials without substrate, the proportion of varnish clams consumed were 4.2 times smaller when substrate was present, but substrate had a negligible effect (1.2 times) on Japanese littlenecks. The proportion of varnish clams consumed increased with crab claw size and were higher across both substrate conditions than the proportion of Japanese littlenecks consumed; however, the proportion of Japanese littleneck clams consumed increased faster with claw size than that of varnish clams. Our results suggest that including environmental features and variation in prey species can influence the density-dependent foraging described by functional response experiments. Incorporating replicable features of the natural environment into functional response experiments is imperative to make more accurate predictions about the impact of invasive predators on prey populations.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryThe world’s largest water diversion, the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) in China, diverts water from the Danjiangkou Reservoir in the Yangtze River basin to major cities such as Beijing and Tianjin in North China. This water diversion has effectively created an “invasion highway”, facilitating the spread of non-native invasive species such as golden mussels (Limnoperna fortunei) to aquatic ecosystems in Beijing. Despite the significance of this development, the dynamics of the spread and colonization patterns of golden mussels in Beijing have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we used environmental DNA (eDNA)-based early detection to conduct comprehensive surveillance across all water bodies in five river basins from 2020 to 2023. Our results revealed a rapid spread of golden mussels in Beijing over the past four years. Starting with four infested sites identified through field surveys in 2019, the count of sites exhibiting positive eDNA signals experienced a gradual rise. Between 2020 and 2022, an additional 10–13 sites were confirmed, followed by a substantial increase to 28 additional sites in 2023. Conventional field surveys confirmed the presence of golden mussels at 16 sites between 2020–2023. To date, golden mussels have rapidly expanded their presence to four out of the five investigated river basins, with only the Daqing River remaining uninfested.AbstractThe world’s largest water diversion, the South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) in China, has created an “invasion highway” to introduce invasive golden mussels (Limnoperna fortunei) from the Yangtze River basin to Beijing. To examine the spread and colonization patterns of this newly introduced invasive species, we conducted comprehensive environmental DNA (eDNA)-based early detection and conventional field surveys across all water bodies in five river basins in Beijing from 2020 to 2023. Our results indicated a rapid spread over the past four years. Among the 130 tested sites, the number of sites with positive signals from eDNA analysis exhibited an annual increase: Commencing with four infested sites identified through field surveys in 2019, eDNA analysis detected an additional 13, 11, and 10 positive sites in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, and a substantial rise comprising an additional 28 sites in 2023. Conventional field surveys detected mussels 1–3 years later than eDNA-based analysis at 16 sites. Across all 16 sites, we detected a low population density ranging from 1 to 30 individuals/m2. These findings collectively indicate that the invasions by golden mussels in Beijing are still in their early stages. To date, golden mussels have successfully colonized four out of the five investigated river basins, including the Jiyun River (22.2\% positive sites), North Canal River (59.6\% positive sites), Chaobai River (40\% positive sites), and Yongding River (63.6\% positive sites), with the North Canal River and Yongding River being the most heavily infested. Currently, only the Daqing River basin remains uninfested. Given the significant number of infested sites and the ongoing transport of large new propagules via SNWTP, further rapid spread and colonization are anticipated across aquatic ecosystems in Beijing and beyond. Consequently, we call for the proper implementation of effective management strategies, encompassing early detection, risk assessment, and the use of appropriate control measures to mitigate the potential ecological and economic damages in invaded ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Non-indigenous species (NIS) contribute to the decrease of native species’ diversity on a local and global scale. One of Europe’s most significant donors of freshwater invasions is the Ponto-Caspian Region. Following the construction of artificial canals connecting isolated waterbodies and the resulting heavy boat traffic, the Ponto-Caspian Amphipoda started to spread in Europe. Four amphipod species: Dikerogammarus haemobaphes, Dikerogammarus villosus, Pontogammarus robustoides and Chaetogammarus ischnus have invaded the Masurian Lakeland (North-eastern Poland). Based on literature and our data, we studied their distribution in 22 lakes in the region during the years 2001–2016. We analysed their distribution against several water quality parameters and levels of anthropogenic pressure. Our results also present the first records of two new invaders, D. villosus and C. ischnus, in the studied area. We show that the relative abundance and frequency of these two species rapidly increase and, simultaneously, the populations of the earlier invaders, i.e. D. haemobaphes and P. robustoides, decrease. The native species – Gammarus lacustris – seems to be negatively affected by NIS richness, as well as by the proximity of towns. The spread of NIS in the lakes appears to be facilitated by boating and the lower complexity of the shoreline. Our study shows how anthropogenic pressure, especially tourism, can facilitate bioinvasion, jeopardising native biodiversity unless appropriate regulations are implemented.},

	abstract = {The spread of non-native species is one of the outcomes of global change, threatening many native communities through predation and competition. Freshwater ecosystems are particularly affected by species turnover with non-native species. One species that has been established in Central Europe for many decades – or even a few centuries – is the amphipod crustacean Gammarus roeselii. Although G. roeselii is nowadays widespread in major river systems, there have been recent reports of its spread into smaller streams that are typically inhabited by the native species Gammarus fossarum. Due to their leaf shredding ability, G. fossarum takes up a key position in headwater streams. This raises the important question, to what extent G. roeselii can equivalently take over this function. To answer this question, we collected both species from nine different sites in a mid-mountain river system (Kinzig catchment, Hesse, Germany) and investigated their functional similarity using a combination of stable isotope analysis, gut content and functional morphology. The species hardly differed in morphological characteristics, only females showed differences in some traits. Gut content analysis indicated a broad dietary overlap, while stable isotopes showed a higher trophic position of G. roeselii. The observed functional overlap could intensify interspecific competition and allow the larger and more predaceous G. roeselii to replace G. fossarum in the future as a headwater keystone species. However, the differentiation in the stable isotopes also shows that co-existence can occur by occupying different trophic niches. Moreover, the wide range of inhabited sites and exploited resources demonstrate the omnivorous lifestyle of G. roeselii, which is likely to help the species succeed in rapidly changing environments.},

	abstract = {Human activities have facilitated the invasion of freshwater ecosystems by various organisms. Especially, invasive bivalves such as the quagga mussels, Dreissena bugensis, have the potential to alter ecosystem function as they heavily affect the food web. Quagga mussels occur in high abundance, have a high filtration rate, quickly spread within and between waterbodies via pelagic larvae, and colonize various substrates. They have invaded various waterbodies across the Northern Hemisphere. In Central Europe, they have invaded multiple large and deep perialpine lakes with first recordings in Lake Geneva in 2015 and 2016 in Lake Constance. In the deep perialpine lakes, quagga mussels quickly colonized the littoral zone but are also abundant deeper ({\textgreater}80 m), where they are often thinner and brighter shelled. We analysed 675 quagga mussels using ddRAD sequencing to gain in-depth insights into the genetic population structure of quagga mussels across Central European lakes and across various sites and depth habitats in Lake Constance. We revealed substantial genetic differentiation amongst quagga mussel populations from three unconnected lakes, and all populations showed high genetic diversity and effective population size. In Lake Constance, we detected no genetic differentiation amongst quagga mussels sampled across different sites and depth habitats. We also did not identify any convincing candidate loci evidential for adaptation along a depth gradient and a transplant experiment showed no indications of local adaptation to living in the deep based on investigating growth and survival. Hence, the shallow-water and the deep-water morphotypes seem to be a result of phenotypic plasticity rather than local adaptation to depth. In conclusion, our ddRAD approach revealed insight into the establishment of genetically distinct quagga mussel populations in three perialpine lakes and suggests that phenotypic plasticity and life history traits (broadcast spawner with high fecundity and dispersing pelagic larvae) facilitate the fast spread and colonization of various depth habitats by the quagga mussel.},

	abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) are a primary environmental concern, threatening freshwater ecosystems and public health and causing economic damages in the billions of dollars annually. These blooms, predominantly driven by phytoplankton species like cyanobacteria, thrive in nutrient-rich, warm, and low-wind environments. Because of the adverse impacts of HABs, this review examines various control methods, focusing on biological strategies as sustainable solutions. While effective in disrupting algal populations, traditional chemical and physical interventions carry ecological risks and can be resource-intensive. Biological control methods, including biomanipulation and using algicidal microorganisms such as Streptococcus thermophiles, Myxobacteria, and Lopharia spadicea, emerge as eco-friendly alternatives offering long-term benefits. Additionally, barley and rice straw application has demonstrated efficacy in curbing HAB growth. These biological approaches work by inhibiting algal proliferation, disrupting cellular structures, and fostering algal cell aggregation. Despite their advantages over conventional methods, biological controls face challenges, including intricate ecological interactions. This article delves into the latest biological techniques aimed at eradicating HABs, intending to diminish their frequency and reduce toxin levels in aquatic environments. While most research to date has been confined to laboratory settings, scaling these methods to field applications presents hurdles due to the variability and complexity of natural ecosystems. The review underscores the need for further research and development in this critical area of environmental science.},

	abstract = {Shellfish reefs around the world have become degraded, and recent efforts have focused on restoring these valuable habitats. This study is the first to assess the efficacy of a bouchot-style reef, where mussels were seeded onto wooden stakes and deployed in a hypereutrophic estuary in Australia. While {\textgreater}60\% of translocated mussels survived one month, after ten months, only 2\% remained alive, with this mortality being accompanied, at least initially, by declining body condition. Mussel survival, growth, body condition and recruitment were greater on the top section of the stake, implying that the distance from the substrate was important. More fish species inhabited the reefs (31) than unstructured control sites (17). Reefs were also colonised by a range of invertebrate species, including 11 native and six non-indigenous species. However, the number of individuals declined from 4495 individuals from 14 species in December 2019 to 35 individuals representing 4 species in March 2021, likely due to hypoxic bottom water conditions following unseasonal rainfall. Although the bouchot-style reefs were unable to sustain mussels and other invertebrates over sequential years, this approach has the potential to be successful if deployed in shallow water or intertidal zones, which are largely exempt from biotic and abiotic stressors characteristic of deeper waters in microtidal estuaries.},

False mussels are among the most notable fresh- and brackish water invaders. The invasive Mytilopsis leucophaeata in Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon-RFL (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) is the most abundant macrofaunal invertebrate, widely established and distributed throughout the lagoon. This study aimed to assess microplastic contamination in this invasive filter feeder and evaluate its potential use as a bioindicator. Agglomerates ({\textasciitilde}100 mussels) were manually collected using a stainless-steel spatula in ten sampling areas distributed throughout the whole lagoon and kept frozen. In the laboratory, 60 individuals were sorted by area for soft-tissue digestion. Each pool of 10 soft-tissue mussels (n = 6 by area) was wet-weighted and then placed in a 150-mL decontaminated glass beaker with 50 mL of 10\% KOH. Samples were heated (40 °C) for 48 h, and digested samples were filtered in glass-fiber membranes. Microplastics were found in all samples of mussels (n = 60) from RFL; the particles were mostly lower than 100 µm with a mean concentration (±SD) of 35.96 ± 47.64 MPs g wet-weight−1. Microplastics were distinguished in seven shapes with different occurrences in samples (\%): fiber (43.3\%); fragment (34.3\%); film (16.3\%); sponge/foam (4.9\%); pellet (0.57\%), rope/filaments (0.17\%); and undefined (0.4\%). Thirteen colors of microplastics were found, but transparent (54.94\%), black (10.77\%), and white (9.36\%) were the most common. Mytilopsis leucophaeata were useful to assess microplastic contamination in RFL and might be preferentially used in other invaded brackish systems instead of native and often threatened bivalves. Our results confirm the effective application of bivalves as an indicator of coastal microplastic pollution.},

Aquaculture, however, is also undertaken for several other purposes. Further development of aquaculture can be challenged by parasites, which can cause serious mortality among cultured species and incur costs of prevention and treatment of such infections and may render the final product unsellable. Of further risk are farmed species, which may act as a reservoir of parasites that threaten humans. Here, we review the eukaryotic parasites affecting various species used in aquaculture. These parasites are very diverse and of different significance in terms of morbidity.AbstractParasites are very diverse and common in both natural populations and in stocks kept in aquacultural facilities. For most cultured species, there are important bacteria and viruses causing diseases, but eukaryotic parasites are also very important. We review the various combinations of aquacultured species and eukaryotic parasitic groups and discuss other problems associated with aquaculture such as eutrophication, zoonotic species, and invasive species, and we conclude that further development of aquaculture in a sustainable manner must include a holistic approach (One Health) where many factors (e.g., human health, food safety, animal health and welfare, environmental and biodiversity protection and marketability mechanisms, etc.) are considered.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryThe development of cost-effective protocols with optimized rearing systems and conditions is an essential requirement to assure the economic feasibility of mussel production in hatchery systems. The Mediterranean mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis plays a relevant role on the scale of bivalve aquaculture, whose expansion has deep economic and environmental consequences. The current study establishes the protocols to improve pediveliger settlement, post-larvae production and growth, through the optimization of the stocking density of larvae and post-larvae in hatchery systems. This standardized protocol for mussel rearing can enhance the production of quality seed to supply the fattening industry as well as for environmental restoration.AbstractIn mussel hatchery systems, the settlement process is a crucial element influencing seed yield. The current study assayed the influence of five densities of competent pediveliger larvae on settlement success and post-larvae production. We showed an inverse relationship between density and settlement efficiency, e.g., an attachment success of 99.4\% at the lowest density (35 larvae/cm2) but only 9\% at the highest density (210 larvae/cm2). However, post-larvae production was higher at intermediate larvae densities (70 larvae/cm2). The reimplementation of treatments upon post-larvae density after 6 weeks post settlement showed that the lowest-density groups bore both the highest post-larvae growth rate (22.24 ± 4.60 µm/day) and the largest head batch (48\% of the size distribution), as compared to the higher-post-larvae-density groups. These results highlight the importance of optimizing both pediveliger larvae density and post-larvae density, to maximize high-quality seed yield in local hatcheries. Current rearing technologies would assure a timely commercial seed production to protect natural sea rocky beds in Alboran Sea coasts.},

These genes were found to be expressed in different tissues and developmental stages of rohu. The expression levels of these antioxidant genes in the liver and anterior kidney tissues of rohu juveniles were modulated in response to bacterial infection (Aeromonas hydrophila), parasite infection (Argulus siamensis), poly I:C stimulation and ammonia stress. Additionally, the recombinant proteins derived from these genes exhibited significant antioxidant and antibacterial activities. These proteins also demonstrated a protective effect against A. hydrophila infection in rohu and had an immunomodulatory role. Furthermore, indirect ELISA assay systems were developed to measure these protein levels in healthy as well as A. hydrophila and ammonia-induced rohu serum. Overall, this study characterized and emphasised the importance of the antioxidant mechanism in rohu’s defence against oxidative damage and microbial diseases.},

Using a species-specific real-time colorimetric loop-mediated isothermal amplification (qcLAMP) for the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene, we demonstrate a high sensitivity with a limit of detection of 0.002 ng DNA per reaction, equivalent to only 50 copies of the COI gene. The assay is specific to the target in the presence of closely related and co- occurring species, and it is quantitative over five orders of magnitude. We validated the assay using aquarium water samples and further demonstrated its utility on natural eDNA samples collected from locations around the island of Crete where P. miles had been sighted. P. miles was indeed detected in three out of nine locations, two nature reserves and a closed bay. Lack of detection in the remaining locations suggest that populations are still at a low density. We also demonstrate the feasibility of P. miles eDNA qualitative detection directly from the filter used to collect eDNA-containing particles, completely omitting DNA extraction. Overall, we present a new approach for fast and targeted eDNA quantification. The developed LAMP assay together with the quantitative real-time colorimetric detection approach open new possibilities for monitoring invasive P. miles in the field.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

Despite these fundamental differences, there are common transcriptional mechanisms that underline their evolutionary linkages, particularly in the field of functional genomics. By elucidating both conserved and unique regulatory strategies, this review provides essential insights into the comparative embryology and developmental dynamics of these groups. The objective of this review is to clarify the shared and distinctive characteristics of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.

	abstract = {Managing invasive species with prevention and early-detection strategies can avert severe ecological and economic impacts. Horizon scanning, an evidence-based process combining risk screening and consensus building to identify threats, has become a valuable tool for prioritizing invasive species management and prevention. We assembled a working group of experts from academic, government, and nonprofit agencies and organizations, and conducted a multi-taxa horizon scan for Florida, USA, the first of its kind in North America. Our primary objectives were to identify high-risk species and their introduction pathways, to detail the magnitude and mechanism of potential impacts, and, more broadly, to demonstrate the utility of horizon scanning. As a means to facilitate future horizon scans, we document the process used to generate the list of taxa for screening. We evaluated 460 taxa for their potential to arrive, establish, and cause negative ecological and socioeconomic impacts, and identified 40 potential invaders, including alewife, zebra mussel, crab-eating macaque, and red swamp crayfish. Vertebrates and aquatic invertebrates posed the greatest invasion threat, over half of the high-risk taxa were omnivores, and there was high confidence in the scoring of high-risk taxa. Common arrival pathways were ballast water, biofouling of vessels, and escape from the pet/aquarium/horticulture trade. Competition, predation, and damage to agriculture/forestry/aquaculture were common impact mechanisms. We recommend full risk analysis for the high-risk taxa; increased surveillance at Florida's ports, state borders, and high-risk pathways; and periodic review and revision of the list. Few horizon scans detail the comprehensive methodology (including list-building), certainty estimates for all scoring categories and the final score, detailed pathways, and the magnitude and mechanism of impact. Providing this information can further inform prevention efforts and can be efficiently replicated in other regions. Moreover, harmonizing methodology can facilitate data sharing and enhance interpretation of results for stakeholders and the general public.},

	abstract = {The stone moroko (Pseudorasbora parva) is an invasive species which spreads rapidly in European water bodies and occupies free ecological niches. In the years 2019–2020, monthly analyses of its population structure were carried out in the Wardynka River (western Poland), determining the age, size (TL and SL), body weight, growth, Fulton’s condition factor, and the parameters of the length–weight relationship. In addition, quantitative descriptions of the parasite communities were made. End-point PCR was used to verify the presence of Sphaerothecum destruens in the fish. The age structure of the population was dominated by fish at the age of 1+ to 3+, and the maximum age was 5 + . The TL of the fish ranged from 2.50 to 10.60 cm (average 6.24 cm), SL from 2.10 to 9.50 cm (average 5.20 cm), and body weight from 0.15 to 11.43 g (average 2.74 g). The average body weight and length of males were higher than in females. The average Fulton’s condition factor for the whole sample was 1.44 ± 0.24 and was similar for both sexes. The slope of the regression line (b {\textgreater} 3) indicates an allometric relationship between the length and weight of fish of both sexes. Back-calculated estimates of standard length fitted the von Bertalanffy growth function, although Taylor’s criterion showed that the asymptotic length (Linf) was overestimated. Comparison of the von Bertalanffy growth function parameters revealed differences between sexes. The presence of parasites not previously recorded in stone moroko in Poland was confirmed: Dactylogyrus squameus, Phyllodistomum elongatum, P. folium, Posthodiplostomum cuticola (metacercaria), and Bivalvia gen. sp. (glochidia). Electrophoresis of the end-point PCR product did not reveal any signs of amplification for either of the primer sets used. S. destruens was not detected in any of the analysed samples of stone moroko.},

	abstract = {Quagga mussels have expanded their range across the northern hemisphere in recent decades owing to their dispersal abilities, prolific reproduction rates, and broad ecological tolerances. Their remarkable capacity to filter particulates from the water column has had profound effects on inland aquatic ecosystems. In the North American Great Lakes, quagga mussel populations have increased inexorably since the late 1980’s, but it remains unclear whether quagga mussels will follow a similar trajectory in Europe where they have appeared more recently. Here we apply knowledge from a long-term quagga population monitoring effort in the North American lakes to predict future quagga populations in deep European lakes, where quaggas are quickly becoming a conspicuous part of the underwater landscape. We predict that quagga mussel biomass in Lakes Biel, Constance, and Geneva may increase by a factor of 9–20 by 2045. Like in North America, this increase may be characterized by a shift to larger individuals and deeper depths as the population matures. If realized, this rapid expansion of quagga mussels would likely drive the largest aquatic ecosystem change in deep European lakes since the eutrophication period of the mid-20th century.},

In this work, we provide a state-of-the-art review of the latest development of 3D printing for bioengineered neural constructs. Various 3D printing techniques for neural tissue-engineered scaffolds or living cell-laden constructs are summarized and compared in terms of their unique advantages. We highlight the advanced strategies by integrating topographical, biochemical and electroactive cues inside 3D-printed neural constructs to replicate in vivo-like microenvironment for functional neural regeneration. The typical applications of 3D-printed bioengineered constructs for in vivo repair of injured nervous tissues, bio-electronics interfacing with native nervous system, neural-on-chips as well as brain-like tissue models are demonstrated.

	abstract = {BackgroundAlthough freshwater ecosystems cover less than 1\% of the earth's surface, they support extremely high levels of biodiversity and provide vital ecosystem services. However, due to the introduction of non-native fishes, aquatic ecosystem functioning has been altered, and in some cases, declined sharply. Quantifying the impacts of invasive species has proven problematic. In this study, we examined the relative trophic position of native piscivorous fishes to estimate the effects of invasive Nile tilapia on food webs in the downstream sections of an invaded large subtropical river, the Pearl River, China. Furthermore, we quantified how native piscivorous fish diets changed as the Nile tilapia invasion progressed.ResultsThe trophic position of the widely distributed and locally important economically harvested piscivorous culter fish (Culterrecurviceps), mandarinfish (Sinipercakneri), and catfish (Pelteobagrusfulvidraco) lowered significantly in the invaded Dongjiang River compared to an uninvaded reference Beijiang River. The lower trophic position of these piscivorous fishes was reflected by a major reduction in the proportion of prey fish biomass in their diets following the Nile tilapia invasion. Small fishes in the diet of culter fish from the reference river (33\% small fishes, 17\% zooplankton) shifted to lower trophic level zooplankton prey in the invaded river (36\% zooplankton, 25\% small fish), possibly due to the presence of Nile tilapia. Additionally, small fishes in the diet of mandarinfish in the reference river (46\% small fishes, 11\% aquatic insects) declined in the invaded river (20\% aquatic insects, 30\% small fishes). Similarly, the diet of catfish from the reference river shifted from fish eggs (25\% fish eggs, 25\% aquatic insects) to aquatic insects in the invaded river (44\% aquatic insects, 5\% fish eggs).ConclusionsThe results of this study contributed to a growing body of evidence, suggesting that Nile tilapia can modify trophic interactions in invaded ecosystems. It is crucial to understand the processes outlined in this study in order to better assess non-native aquatic species, conserve the stability of freshwater ecosystems, and improve current conservation strategies in reaches of the Pearl River and other similar rivers that have experienced invasions of non-native species.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13717-022-00412-x},
	abstract = {BackgroundAquatic invertebrate species that have broad salinity tolerances may be pre-adapted for invasion success and biogeographic distributional range expansions, facilitated by human-mediated dispersal (HMD), leading to a trend to become neocosmopolitan across many regions of the world. This pattern appears to characterize many Ponto-Caspian (P-C) aquatic invertebrates, which have a {\textgreater} 100-year history as aquatic invasive species (AIS), spreading throughout much of Eurasia and for some, in North America and beyond. Our study compiles comparative salinity conditions and distributional data for AIS invertebrate species globally versus those originating from the P-C region, to test whether they statistically differ.ResultsOur investigation discerns that a total of 1861 invertebrate AIS taxa have been recorded worldwide, with (A) 70.5\% exclusively living in the saline adaptive zone of brackish (0.5–30 ppt; A1) and/or marine waters ({\textgreater} 30 ppt; A2), (B) 20\% in the freshwater adaptive zone alone (0–0.5 ppt), (C) 7.5\% being euryhaline (across both A and B), and (D) 2\% being semi-aquatic in either (D1) freshwater/terrestrial or (D2) saline/terrestrial environments. In contrast, our results indicate the following proportions for AIS invertebrates of P-C origins: (A) 27\% exclusively inhabit the saline adaptive zone, (B) 25\% are entirely freshwater, (C) 45\% are euryhaline, and (D) 3\% are semi-aquatic, significantly differing from the global pattern. Euryhaline AIS native to the P-C region thus markedly outnumber (45\%) those originating from other regions (7.5\%), likely pre-adapting them for widespread establishment in harbors, estuaries, and coastal areas. Moreover, most P-C invertebrate AIS (70\%) contain freshwater-tolerant populations (B + C), rendering them very successful invaders of inland water bodies. These broad salinity tolerances of P-C AIS underlie their tremendous invasion successes and growing neocosmopolitan distributions with HMD.ConclusionsAn evolutionary and recent history of broad salinity tolerances of a large proportion of P-C invertebrates appears to enhance their ability to invade, establish, and spread in new regions, especially harbors, estuaries, and freshwaters, leading to their increasing neocosmopolitan distributions. This trend likely will continue—accelerating with climate change and increased global transportation—meriting worldwide conservation agency focus and cooperation, along with public education programs aimed to rapidly identify and circumvent new introductions and spread.},

[...]Numerical models provide a cost-effective way to understand biological connectivity, when extensively calibrated (Montaño et al., 2023; Souza et al., 2023) and compared to in situ biological analyses for key sites.

Models can then be used to give a fair overview of the large-scale picture before committing to more expensive and time-consuming field experiments. ● The richness of information held by local and traditional communities is a key resource to guide initial research questions, progress (e.g. provide local resources and ethical framework), and fieldwork planning (e.g. location of mussel beds), and contribute to maximizing research outcomes (e.g. information is tailored to community needs).

2.2 Co-design is essential The innovative subsurface ocean observing system developed and deployed during the Moana Project - the Mangōpare sensor system (Jakoboski et al., 2023) - was only possible thanks to a broad range of partnerships with the commercial fishing industry, local communities, educational vessels, citizen scientists, and others.

[...]building cross-cultural relationships may require stepping into traditional and/or cultural ways of sharing knowledge, which should be valued, resourced, and supported appropriately. 2.4 Address Indigenous rights Acknowledging the presence and rights of Indigenous communities in the areas where research is being conducted and identifying ways to provide appropriate attribution and authorship was a key lesson (Hudson et al., 2023).},

	abstract = {The issue of biological invasions in aquatic ecosystems is becoming increasingly severe in the contemporary world. Due to the lack of monitoring and management systems for aquatic invasive species, the difficulty in identifying aquatic invasive species, and the limited effectiveness of conventional control methods in aquatic environments, biological control in water bodies is comparatively more challenging than other types of interventions. In recent years, environmental DNA (eDNA) survey methods have rapidly developed in various fields, such as biological monitoring, community ecology, paleoenvironmental research, conservation biology, and invasion ecology, due to their unique advantages of being rapid, sensitive, efficient, and non-invasive. Because of these characteristics, this innovative molecular approach has gained wider acceptance and is being increasingly utilized for the detection of biological diversity in aquatic environments. Furthermore, it has emerged as a novel technology to address the pressing and significant issue of aquatic invasive species in the vast freshwater and marine resources of the East Asian region. This paper summarizes a variety of literature sources to summarize the major aquatic invasive species in East Asian countries and the current application status of eDNA technology in their survey processes. Using China as a case study, it expounds on the prospective incorporation of the 4E strategy with eDNA technology for the surveillance of biological invasions. Furthermore, it explores the potential prospects of eDNA technology in species diversity management and policy formulation, offering theoretical guidance for establishing aquatic invasive species monitoring systems. From a technological standpoint, the integration of eDNA technology with the 4E strategy holds significant potential for application, thereby offering a promising reference for the formulation of policies related to the management of aquatic biological invasions and biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Amultigenerational study on Ceriodaphnia dubia was carried out by exposing three subsequent generations to pharmaceuticals chlorpromazine (CPZ) and diclofenac (DCF), and two lanthanide chlorides, gadolinium as GdCl3 and europium as EuCl3. As the treatments, environmentally relevant concentrations were chosen (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 mg/L for CPZ; 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/L for DCF; 0.425, 4.25 and 42.5 µg/L for Gd and 0.41, 4.1 and 41 µg/L for Eu). Survival, population growth and reproduction success were evaluated at 21 and 30 days of exposure, and the whole observation period lasted 40 days. The least sensitive to all selected substances was the first daphnid generation (F1). Within 21-day exposure, no significant effects of the psychotropic drug CPZ on C. dubia survival were observed in generations F1–F3. The anti-inflammatory drug DCF did not affect survival in the F1 generation; however, it significantly reduced survival in the F3 generation at 1–10 mg/L. Both lanthanides did not affect survival in the F1 and F2 generations of C. dubia but considerably decreased survival in the F3 at 4–42 µg/L. Both pharmaceuticals stimulated the reproduction of C. dubia in the F1 generation, while inhibition occurred at the highest tested concentrations in generations F2 and F3. The inhibitory effect on the reproductive success of lanthanides in the F2 generation resembled that for CPZ but not for DCF. The dynamics of adverse effects during the 21–30-day period revealed that despite increased mortality in the controls (up to 30\%), concentrations used in the study minified, in most instances, the survival and aggravated population growth and reproduction success of C. dubia. Our data suggest that C. dubia as a test organism can be used for 21 days in multigenerational investigations, especially when testing close to environmental concentrations. In this respect, the standard C. dubia chronic toxicity assay seems limited since prolonged observations and several generations of daphnids are required to obtain reliable information for the risk assessment of potentially aggressive chemicals.},

	abstract = {Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) is a salmonid fish of significant conservation value. However, conservation efforts are hindered by a lack of fundamental information regarding details such as current population distribution, migratory patterns, and natal habitats. In the current study, we designed, optimized, and field- and laboratory-validated an environmental DNA (eDNA) and environmental RNA (eRNA) assay for Arctic grayling biomonitoring. Using an in silico approach, a robust species-specific eDNA assay was generated, and filtering and extraction protocols were optimized for maximal eDNA yield. A Preserve, Precipitate, Lyse, Precipitate, and Purify (PPLPP) extraction method generated 70-fold higher eDNA yields than a column-based approach. Species-specificity relative to co-occurring salmonid fish was validated, and no significant amplification was noted for rainbow trout, brook trout, or mountain whitefish. Shedding rates of eDNA were around eight to nine times higher than those of eRNA, although the two types of nucleic acids decayed at similar rates. Shedding and decay rates were subsequently used to build detection probability models that account for pool size and water exchange rates. These data indicate that eDNA and eRNA are detectable in pools up to 32,500 m3 in volume and with water flow of less than 0.5 m3s−1 when an Arctic grayling is present. This knowledge can be implemented when designing field sampling strategies. Finally, the assay successfully amplified Arctic grayling eDNA from field-collected samples, with signal strength indicating preferred Arctic grayling habitat or conditions that favored the concentration and retention of eDNA.},

	abstract = {Invasive fish can profoundly affect communities they invade. In Hawai'i, invasive fishes have become established in many anchialine pools, threatening the persistence of resident invertebrates, including several endangered species. Tools to eradicate invasive fishes from these pools are lacking. This study tested the efficacy of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas diffused into anchialine pool water as a method to eradicate invasive Mozambique tilapia \{\vphantom{\}}Oreochromis mossambicus), guppies \{\vphantom{\}}Poecilia reticulata), and western mosquitofish \{\vphantom{\}}Gambusia affinis). We first conducted aquarium trials to identify how these fishes were affected by elevated CO2 and the concomitant reduction in pH. We then carried out field trials in pools containing these fish in one pool each at two national historical parks on the Island of Hawafi during July 2021-January 2022. We also developed environmental DNA (eDNA) protocols to detect fish that may have survived CO2 treatments. The effect of CO2 on fish behavior varied among species; at pH 5.3 (CO2 = 255 mg/L) for tilapia and 5.0 (CO2 = 488 mg/L) for tilapia, guppies, and mosquitofish, all generally lost their ability to swim, showed slow or no gill movement, and altered their position in the water column. No tilapia survived the trials (n = 4 and 6 individuals at pH 5.3 and 5.0, respectively). In contrast, 41.7\% (n = 12) of adult guppies and 66.7\% (n = 12) of adult mosquitofish survived treatment at pH 5.0. In the field we were unable to reduce anchialine pool water pH below 5.7. Regardless, we were able to eradicate tilapia from one pool over four sequential treatments. Post-treatment eDNA assessments supported visual surveys, confirming our results. We were not able to eradicate guppies and mosquitofish. Results from this study show that CO2 can be an effective tool for eradicating invasive tilapia from anchialine pools, and post-treatment eDNA assessments can provide managers with a method for evaluating the success of eradication efforts.},

	abstract = {The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) invaded the Great Lakes in the 1990s and the species continued expansion into inland bodies of water, raising basin wide concerns for negative ecological impacts. The Lower Fox River (LFR), Wisconsin, USA, is the state's largest tributary linking the Great Lakes to inland Lake Winnebago through a fragmented waterway of eight lock and dam structures across 62.0 river kilometers (RKm). Round goby were detected in the LFR lower river reaches, in the early 2000's below an invasive species barrier (completely sealed structure) located near the midpoint of the LFR (RKm 31.5), but in 2015, the species was observed above the barrier raising concerns for upstream invasion. This discovery prompted the closure of the upper most navigational lock system (Menasha Lock, RKm 62.0) separating the outflow of Lake Winnebago to the LFR. The goal of this study was to assess the distribution and abundance of round goby throughout the entire LFR in 2019-2021 using baited minnow traps. We further evaluate differences in capture rates between combinations of minnow trap styles, bait types, and bait quantities. A total of 1,007 round goby were captured during monitoring surveys throughout the LFR (2019-2021), confirming presence in all river segments with maximum upstream extent reaching Menasha Lock. Highest densities of round goby are found below the invasive species barrier (RKm 31.5), but males and females are present at the current maximum upstream distribution. An additional 834 round goby were captured during the comparison of trapping strategies and suggest round-style minnow traps baited with food (i.e., dog food or hotdog) are successful in capturing round goby and outperform other trap/bait types. Continued monitoring would help describe trends in abundance and adaptive sampling approaches will improve detection.},

These snail species harbor parasites, predate on the eggs of native fish fauna and are prolific in their ability to spread across various freshwater environments. While several recent studies have explored the population structure and range expansion of the species in the United States, none have formally addressed control or eradication strategies. In this study, we attempted to do this by carrying out a series of assays to determine the efficacy of the popular molluscicide, niclosamide monohydrate against both species under both acute and chronic exposure. Our results show that the lethal dose required to achieve 50 \% mortality (LD50) for C. georgiana and C. japonica was 1.509 mg/L and 1.296 mg/L respectively. In acute exposure experiments we observed that at higher concentrations, all C. georgiana specimens in experimental treatment tanks were dead but C. japonica never reached 100\% mortality even at the highest concentration. In chronic exposure experiments, C. georgiana did not survive more than a week while C. japonica did not survive more than 11 days in the experimental tanks. We conclude that niclosamide is an effective chemical control agent for eradication of invasive mystery snails in North America. However, further studies exploring the effect of the molluscide on non-target species, especially local native fauna, should be investigated prior to any scaled up field applications.},

The federal and California secondary maximum contaminant level and action level for copper in drinking water are 1.0 and 1.3 mg/L as Cu, respectively; therefore, results for the 16.7 pL/L EarthTec QZ (1.0 mg/L as Cu) test condition were the main reference point for assessing the efficacy of EarthTec QZ as a feasible treatment strategy. Under this condition, veliger mortality at two study sites, Lake Mathews, and a downstream water treatment plant, was found to be greater than 60\% and 85\% after 5 hours, and 95\% and 100\% after 24 hours, respectively. Lower efficacy was observed for the Lake Piru study site, with approximately 30\% veliger mortality after 24 hours. Alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon, and chemical oxygen demand were found to be significant variables for veliger mortality in these hard water locations based on linear regression modeling. The three non-target indicator species were adversely affected by EarthTec QZ at concentrations tested. These results indicate that this product has potential as an effective chemical control agent against quagga veligers at low doses, but the aforementioned water quality parameters must be considered with full-scale application to optimize target efficacy, while minimizing exposure to non-target species and costs.},

	abstract = {Bivalves may play an ecological role as ecosystem engineers by changing sediment physical structure. As a filter/suspension feeder, they can produce biodeposits, and their burrowing activities can stir sediment. In this study, we investigated whether the abundance of Venus clam (Gafrarium tumidum Röding, 1798) influences sediment accretion in the sandy intertidal area of Pari Island, Indonesia. We created 18 plots consisting of nine defaunated and nine non-defaunated treatment plots. On each plot, 111-559 clams were deployed, and four pieces of one-inch PVC were planted randomly to see sediment elevation. Sediment accretion was measured by sediment elevation. Observations were carried out for seven months. At the end of the observations, clam abundances were 0-64 ind/m2 in the defaunated plots and 0-47 ind/m2 in the non-defaunated plots. The average sediment accretion in the defaunated plots was 0.98-3.3 cm, while in the non-defaunated plots was 1.95-4.43 cm. This study showed that the clam had no significant effect (p-value {\textgreater} 0.05) on sediment accretion in both plots as its abundance was insufficient to alter sediment. The sediment accretion occurred not caused by clam but by others such as sipuncula and physical oceanography factors in the research location.},

Understanding the effects of heat stress on the physiological processes of fish is essential for better aquaculture and fisheries management. In this experiment, a heating rod was used to increase the temperature at 2°C/h to study the changes of energy allocation (CEA) and energy metabolity-related enzyme activities, including pepsin, trypsin, amylase, lipase, acid phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, glutamic oxalic aminotransferase and energy reserve (Ea), energy expenditure (ETS), in juvenile yellowfin tuna cells under acute temperature stress. The results showed that the Ea of juvenile yellowfin tuna muscles in response to high temperature (34°C) was significantly lower than that of the control (28°C), and it also increased ETS. At 6 h, CEA decreased slightly in the high-temperature group, but, the difference in CEA between 24 h and 0 h decreased. After heat stress for 6 h, the activities of acid phosphatase (ACP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and glutamic oxalacetic transaminase (AST) increased, indicating that the metabolic rate was accelerated. After heat stress for 24 h, the activity of ALT decreased, indicating that with time elapsed, the activities of some protein metabolizing enzymes increased, and some decreased. In this study, digestive enzymes, trypsin and lipase increased gradually. After heat stress, Ea and Ec change significantly. Yellowfin tuna muscles use lipids in response to sharp temperature increases at high temperatures, red muscles respond to temperature changes by increasing energy in the early stages, but not nearly as much, and white muscles reduce lipids.},

Vector control is the main option to prevent mosquito-borne diseases, and an accurate genome sequence of these mosquitoes is essential to better understand their biology and to develop effective control strategies.MethodsA de novo genome assembly of Ae. japonicus (Ajap1) and Ae. koreicus (Akor1) have been produced based on a hybrid approach that combines Oxford Nanopore long reads and Illumina short reads data. Their quality was ascertained using various metrics. Masking of repetitive elements, gene prediction and functional annotation was performed.ResultsSequence analysis revealed a very high presence of repetitive DNA and, among others, thermal adaptation genes and insecticide-resistance genes. Through the RNAseq analysis of larvae and adults of Ae. koreicus and Ae. japonicus exposed to different temperatures we also identified genes showing a differential temperature-dependent activation.ConclusionsThe assembly of Akor1 and Ajap1 genomes constitutes the first updated collective knowledge of the genomes of both mosquito species, providing the possibility of understanding key mechanisms of their biology such as the ability to adapt to harsh climates and to develop insecticide-resistance mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) is becoming integrated as an established biomonitoring tool, often characterized by detection limits exceeding those of conventional counterparts. However, further improving the sensitivity of these methods may be invaluable for the early detection of invasive species, or for locating remnant populations of endangered species, and the adequate quantification of their abundances. In this study, we provide empirical evidence showing that the implementation of multiple genetic markers targeting different loci is a surprisingly overlooked strategy to increase the sensitivity of single-species detections and quantification of their abundance, particularly at the lower end of the species abundance range. We analyzed 45 natural eDNA samples obtained from a wide range of water bodies in Belgium, in which either the invasive American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) or the rare European weather loach (Misgurnus fossilis) occurred under variable abundances, and compared detection success and precision of quantification of simplex (single locus) versus multiplex (multilocus) droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) analyses. Multiplexing different primer/probe assays targeting independent loci resulted in a significantly enhanced detection probability compared to the simplex analyses, gaining a twofold reduction in the limit of detection (LOD). Also the precision of eDNA quantification significantly improved in multiplex reactions, especially in low concentration samples. This was reflected in a significant reduction in the coefficient of variation (CV) among technical replicates, resulting in an associated decrease of the limit of quantification (LOQ). We conclude that the use of multiple markers can significantly improve the analytical sensitivity of eDNA-based single-species detections and precision of absolute abundance quantifications.},

	abstract = {Molecular techniques using DNA retrieved from community or environmental samples, in particular environmental DNA (eDNA), are becoming increasingly popular for detecting individual species, assessing biodiversity, and quantifying ecological indices. More recently, eDNA has also been proposed as a template for population genetics, and several studies have already tested the feasibility of this approach, mostly looking at vertebrate species. Their results along with general opportunities offered by these types of “community-based” samples, such as the possibility to target multiple species at the same time, have generated great enthusiasm and expectations for using eDNA in population genetics. However, not every aspect of population genetics can be addressed by eDNA-based data and some inherent limitations may challenge its conclusions. Here, we firstly review the state of current knowledge of DNA retrieved from environmental and community samples for population genetics. Then, focusing on eDNA, we summarize the opportunities but also detail four main limitations of its use for population-level inferences, namely, (1) the difficulty to retrieve a species-specific dataset, (2) the potential lack of correlation between observed and true allelic frequencies, (3) the loss of individual information in multi-locus genotyping and linkage between loci, and (4) the uncertainty about the individuals contributing to the sampled DNA pool (e.g., number, life-stage, or sex). Some of these limitations might be overcome with the development of new technologies or models that account for the specificities of eDNA. Others, however, are inherent, and their effect on the inferences must be thoroughly evaluated. The possibility of gaining insights into genetic diversity and population structure from DNA retrieved from community and environmental samples is appealing for scientists, conservation managers, and other practitioners. Yet, to avoid false expectations and incorrect inferences, it is imperative that these limitations are known and considered alongside the opportunities and advantages.},

	abstract = {Molecular tools of species identification based on eNAs (environmental nucleic acids; environmental DNA [eDNA] and environmental RNA [eRNA]) have the potential to greatly transform biodiversity science. However, the ability of eNAs to obtain “real-time” biodiversity estimates may be complicated by the differential persistence and degradation dynamics of the molecular template (eDNA or eRNA) and the barcode marker used. Here, we collected water samples over a 28-day period to comparatively assess species detection using eDNA and eRNA metabarcoding of two distinct barcode markers—a mitochondrial mRNA marker (COI) and a nuclear rRNA marker (18S)—following complete removal of Arthropoda taxa in a semi-natural freshwater system. Our findings demonstrate that Arthropoda community composition was largely influenced by marker choice, rather than molecular template, individual microcosm, or sampling time point. Furthermore, although eRNA may capture similar species diversity as the established eDNA method, this finding may be marker-dependent. Although we found little to no difference in decay rates observed among sample groups (COI eDNA, COI eRNA, 18S eDNA, 18S eRNA), this result is likely due to limitations in the ability of eNA-based metabarcoding to provide a strong correlation between true eNA copy numbers present in the environment and final read counts obtained (following the metabarcoding workflow). Collectively, our findings provide further support for the use of multi-marker assessments in metabarcoding surveys to unravel the broadest taxonomic diversity possible, highlight the limitations of eNA metabarcoding methods in providing accurate decay rate estimates, as well as establish the need for further comparative studies using both metabarcoding and single-species detection methods to assess the persistence and degradation dynamics of eNAs for a diverse range of taxa.},

We applied the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) of persuasion to this context and tested whether messaging that emphasized threat, efficacy, or both threat and efficacy was more effective in persuading wading anglers to implement preventive behaviors. We found support for the EPPM, but for a single exposure to the tested AIS messages, we found no effects of type of message. Pre-message attitudes toward AIS were a better predictor of intended behavior than our messages, indicating a ceiling effect. Highlighting the effectiveness of preventive behaviors (response efficacy) was related to more reactance toward the message. Our findings suggest that messaging may be more effective if it acknowledges wading anglers' experience and awareness of AIS threats while providing straightforward self-efficacy information. Messaging should emphasize the actions wading anglers can perform that reduce AIS introduction risk.},

In addition, research priorities were developed for a fifth thematic area that addressed dreissenid mussel biology. Forty scientists participated in the two-day workshop. Prior to the workshop, participants were asked to review and rank research priorities that were established for a previous version of the QZAP and to offer suggestions on emerging research priorities. During the workshop, subject matter experts presented information describing current knowledge of research and information associated with the thematic areas of early detection monitoring, prevention and containment, rapid response, control and management, and biology in the context of strategies and actions listed in QZAP 2.0. The rankings of previous research priorities and suggestions of emerging priorities were then reviewed, and a revised list of research priorities was formed.

Exposure time also had an effect on biomarkers in different levels. According to the results, the cytotoxicity of DI and MA combination depended on their concentrations. DI or/ and MA, in sub-lethal concentrations, induced oxidative damages in D. polymorpha. Combined exposure of the pesticides can alter their toxicity and may be evidence of increased toxicity and oxidative stress.},

	abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) such as those formed by the ichthyotoxic dinoflagellate, Margalefidinium (aka Cochlodinium) polykrikoides can have adverse effects on bivalves. While M. polykrikoides has caused significant die offs of bivalves and other marine organisms, the Northern quahog or hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria, is comparatively more resistant to this HAB. This study quantified clearance rates of juvenile hard clams (10-20 mm) exposed to three different North American populations of M. polykrikoides (bloom, strain CP1, strain CPSB-1G) as well as the nonharmful cryptophyte, Rhodomonas salina and the nonharmful dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium aureolum, in single and mixed algal exposures. Multiple biovolume exposures with M. polykrikoides bloom water and R. salina (1,000, 1,500, 3,000 cells mL -1 M. polykrikoides biovolume equivalent) were completed to assess the effects of increasing biomass on hard clam clearance rates and selection. Hard clams opened and actively cleared algal mixtures at and below 1,000 M. polykrikoides cells mL -1 . During single species exposures, strain CPSB-1G and R. salina were cleared significantly faster than wild M. polykrikoides populations and strain CP1. During mixed exposures, R. salina was cleared significantly faster than CPSB-1G but not other M. polykrikoides populations and there was no difference between hard clam clearance rates of G. aureolum and R. salina. Clearance rates of M. polykrikoides at {\textgreater}1,500 cells mL -1 M. polykrikoides/R. salina mixtures were not significantly different than zero unlike clearance of those at  1,000 cells mL -1 ) bloom densities. Given this, and the documented survival of hard clams during blooms, M. mercenaria may be candidate for aquaculture and restoration in regions prone to HABs caused by M. polykrikoides.},

The evidence-based policy (EBP) approach has been promoted on the grounds that it provides greater transparency and consistency by relying on 'high quality' information. However, EBP also creates epistemic responsibilities. Decision-making where limited or no empirical evidence exists, such as is often the case in marine systems, creates epistemic obligations for new information acquisition. We argue that philosophical approaches can inform the sciencepolicy interface. Using marine biosecurity examples, we specifically examine the epistemic challenges in the acquisition and acceptance of evidence to inform policy, discussing epistemic due care and biases in consideration of evidence.},

Given existing research, we use a climate match of ≥71.7\% between ecoregions to indicate climatic conditions that will not inhibit the survival of introduced freshwater organisms. Further, we estimate the secondary spread of freshwater invaders to the ecoregions of North America under historical and future climates.ResultsWe identified 54 global freshwater ecoregions with a climate match ≥71.7\% to the recipient Laurentian Great Lakes under historical climatic conditions, and 11 additional ecoregions were predicted to exceed the threshold under climate change. Three of the 11 ecoregions were located in South America, a continent where no matches existed under historical climates and eight were located in the southern United States, southern Europe, Japan and New Zealand. Further, we identify 34 North American ecoregions of potential secondary spread of freshwater invasions from the Great Lakes under historical climatic conditions, and five ecoregions were predicted to exceed the threshold under climate change.Main ConclusionWe provide a climate-match method that can be employed to assess the sources and spread of freshwater invasions under historical and future climate scenarios. Our climate-match method predicted increases in climate match between the recipient region and several potential source regions, and changes in areas of potential spread under climate change. The identified ecoregions are candidates for detailed biosecurity risk assessments and related management actions.},

Changes in clarity impact lake ecosystems and may reflect land use changes or presence of invasive species. Quantifying temporal changes in water clarity can be challenging because clarity varies seasonally, annually, and spatially within and among lakes. We developed a hierarchical generalized additive model to quantify trends in water clarity (Secchi depth) from 1979 to 2018 for 909 Minnesota lakes, accounting for seasonal and spatial variability. Water clarity increased by 0.41 m across lakes from 1984 to 1988 and 2014 to 2018. Lake-specific clarity trends varied: clarity did not change significantly in 59.0\% of lakes, increased in 34.5\% of lakes, and decreased in 6.5\% of lakes. Water clarity dynamics caused considerable variability in littoral area between seasons and years. Our results have wide applications in aquatic ecology, including understanding changes to food webs, assessing fish habitat, and evaluating impacts of invasive species.},

	abstract = {Temperature is an important environmental factor affecting metabolism, growth and life activities of marine bivalves. To reveal the molecular and metabolic responses to heat stress, comparative transcriptomics and metabolomics were performed in the commercially important bivalve, Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum. Comparative transcriptomics revealed a total of 3980 differential genes (DEGs) mainly involved in energy metabolism, protein processing, glycerolphospholipid metabolism, inoxidizability and anti-apoptosis. Comparative metabolomic analysis identified 293 differential metabolites (DEMs) in the heat-stressed clams, including Acetyl-CoA, Beta-D-Glucose, phosphatidylcholine and free amino acids. For the heat-stress clams, they showed the significantly increased enzyme activities of AKP and ACP, as well as antioxidant-related enzyme activities (SOD and CAT) and oxidative damage substance (MDA). The changes in gene expression of glycolysisrelated genes (GLUT1, GLK, HK1 and GPI6) and metabolites (Beta-D-Glucose and Acetyl-CoA) reflect the adjusted energy metabolism in the heat-stressed clams. The protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum may play the important roles in the stability of cell membrane structure during heat adaptation. The increased contents of glycerophospholipid (PC) may be essential to maintain the stability and permeability of cell membrane in the heat-stressed clams. Molecular chaperones (HSP70 and HSP90) may participate in the degradation of misfolded proteins to maintain cell homeostasis during the heat stress. To defense the heat stress, clams also initiate the protection and defense This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article mechanisms by activating antioxidant system, innate immune system and anti-apoptotic system. These findings will shed new lights on molecular and metabolic adaptation to heat stress in the intertidal molluscs in a warming climate at the global scale.},

Malacoherpesvirus-like sequences were also detected through genome sequencing projects in amphioxus (Branchiostoma species) and annelid worm (Capitella teleta), suggesting the existence of a hidden diversity of malacoherpesviruses in aquatic animals. Here, to extend the knowledge on malacoherpesvirus diversity, we searched for the presence of malacoherpesvirus relatives in genomic, transcriptomic and metagenomic datasets, including from the Tara Oceans expedition, and report 4 novel malacoherpesvirus-like genomes (MalacoHV1-4). Genomic analysis suggested gastropods and bivalves as the most probable hosts for these new malacoherpesviruses. Phylogenetic analysis based on the family B DNA polymerase placed the novel MalacoHV1 and MalacoHV3 as sister lineages of OsHV-1 and HaHV-1, respectively, whereas MalacoHV2 and MalacoHV4 showed higher divergence. The viral genome found associated with amphioxus together with MalacoHV4 formed a sister clade to the mollusc and annelid malacoherpesviruses, suggesting an early divergence of the two virus assemblages. In conclusion, although relatively rare in the available sequence databases, the previously undescribed malacoherpesviruses, MalacoHV1-4, circulate in aquatic ecosystems and should be considered as possible emerging viruses under changing environmental conditions.},

This family – Mustelidae – all live in the wild at Aigas, the conservation and field study centre that has been John’s home for more than forty-five years. With the patient and meticulous care of a true naturalist, John observes and records the lives, habits and habitats of these elusive animals. Hours of careful waiting and watching in the woods and loch, the river, fields and moorland is rewarded with insight into how these animals live when unhindered by human interference; sometimes red in tooth and claw, but often playful, familial, curious and surprising. As a boy, badgers and weasels were John’s first encounter with wild animals. Now he has spent fifty years living side-by side with them in the Highlands and come to know much of their ways. Footprints in the Woods is the culmination of that long association with the Mustelidae family, a love letter to the otters, badgers, weasels and pine martens that also call Aigas home, and a reminder of the fragility of habitat and the beauty and variety we have to lose if we don’t choose to actively protect it.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions remain one of the most pressing threats to biodiversity globally, with unprecedented rates of establishment that are unlikely to abate in the future. As such the occurrence of multiple interacting invasive non-native species (INNS) is becoming more common. Despite this, much of the research on the interaction of multiple INNS is conducted within laboratory settings, with field studies remaining rare or being conducted as one-off sampling. There is therefore a deficit of knowledge pertaining to the natural population trajectories of multiple INNS and the wider ecological implications for the structure and function of the native communities. Here we present multiple years of data collected from a reservoir in the United Kingdom, which has undergone invasion by three congener non-native amphipods. We initially observed the coexistence of Dikerogammarus haemobaphes with Crangonyx pseudogracilis under habitat segregation in the reservoir. However, the following year saw complete displacement of C. pseudogracilis and reduced abundances of D. haemobaphes once the more competitive Dikerogammarus villosus established abundant populations in the reservoir. D. villosus exhibited strong effects for the structure and function of the wider macroinvertebrate community composition in addition to driving reductions in taxa and functional richness. Gastropoda taxa appeared to be unaffected by the invasion dynamics. Significant increases in functional divergence (and less so functional dispersion) values were also observed following D. villosus establishment, with this response metric possibly representing an important tool in detecting stress from biological invasions that we urge scientists to test more extensively. In contrast to D. villosus, D. haemobaphes implications for the wider ecological community appeared to be limited. Importantly, we observed evidence to suggest the presence of boom–bust cycles with the explosion of D. villosus leading to a dramatic drop in their abundances the following year. We believe that the wider ecological implications of their abundant populations were so great that resources were not sufficient within the reservoir to support their abundant populations, leading to the observed population collapses. We call for further studies that investigate the population trajectories and wider ecological implications of multiple non-native species in field settings to further our limited knowledge base.},

	abstract = {Aquatic invasive species (AIS) present major ecological and economic challenges globally, endangering ecosystems and human livelihoods. Managers and policy makers thus need tools to predict invasion risk and prioritize species and areas of concern, and they often use native range climate matching to determine whether a species could persist in a new location. However, climate matching for AIS often relies on air temperature rather than water temperature due to a lack of global water temperature data layers, and predictive power of models is seldom evaluated. We developed 12 global lake (water) temperature-derived “BioLake” bioclimatic layers for distribution modeling of aquatic species and compared “climatch” climate matching predictions (from climatchR package) from BioLake with those based on BioClim temperature layers and with a null model. We did this for 73 established AIS in the United States, training the models on their ranges outside of the United States and Canada. Models using either set of climate layers outperformed the null expectation by a similar (but modest) amount on average, but some species were occasionally found in locations with low climatch scores. Mean US climatch scores were higher for most species when using air temperature. Including additional climate layers in models reduced mean climatch scores, indicating that commonly used climatch score thresholds are not absolute but can be context specific and may require calibration based upon climate data used. Although finer resolution global lake temperature data would likely improve predictions, our BioLake layers provide a starting point for aquatic species distribution modeling. Climate matching was most effective for some species that originated at low latitudes or had small ranges. Climatch scores remain useful but limited for predicting AIS risk, perhaps because current ranges seldom fully reflect climatic tolerances (fundamental niches). Managers could consider climate matching as one of a suite of tools that can be used in AIS prioritization.},

	abstract = {Biofouling occurs naturally in aquatic environments when microorganisms attach to surfaces and form colonies. The destruction of equipment has occurred in a number of well-known economic sectors, including the power and water treatment industries. Large ships and boats face performance issues due to biofouling, such as increased fuel costs and drag. Inhibiting surfaces, toxic coatings, foul release coatings, and physical removal are just a few of the techniques that have been created and used to prevent biofouling. Some of these strategies are known to be expensive, not eco-friendly, and time-consuming. Inspired by the surface topography of zebra mussel shells and pilot whale’s skin, it stays biofoul free. This study’s objective is to assess the two bio-inspired topographies’ ability to prevent fouling. This study looks at how fouling organisms would respond to the hydrodynamic properties of the aforementioned topographies as well as whether geometric size and features have an effect on them. This study aims to clarify or advance our current understanding of biomimicry and antifouling technology because testing of biomimicry-based antifouling solutions is lacking. This research focuses on explaining the nature of microorganisms in water that settle on surfaces and how they react to disturbances caused by fluid flow. They don’t tend to build up on the surface due to the relationship between flow and the different sizes of the surface geometry. Test the hypothesis that the non-bounded high shear stress ripple features on the Zebra mussel’s shell have lower antifouling efficiency compared to the Pilot whale’s skin, which contributes to antifouling efficiency because of its high shear nanoridges, micropores, and gel-coated skin properties. Therefore, if the terrain size is smaller than the invasive organism, the effective range of antifouling is expected to be in the range of 100 µm - 300 µm. The performance of the two bio-inspired topographies was assessed using CFD ANSYS (Fluent) in an entirely numerical study. Two CAD-created representations of the bio-inspired topographies were positioned inside a fluid domain (5 mm, 5 mm, and 50 mm) under specific boundary conditions, including no slip walls assigned to the fluid domain walls, an inlet velocity of 0.05 ms-1, and the flowing fluid being water. Detailed surface meshing and mesh quality are necessary to prove a reliable solution. The velocity profile, vorticity, and wall shear stress of the surface were examined in order to determine the antifouling effectiveness. Utilizing contour and streamline plots, the flow over the topography models was examined. Based on the hypothesis, the results showed that not only does geometry affect microbial settlement but also size. Topographic patterns with larger sizes were associated with higher settlements of algae and barnacles in low velocity areas. Microbial settling may also be aided by the emergence of low shear stress and vorticity in the lower part of the topography. However, the high shear region that forms close to kink sites or sharp edges and the hydrodynamic disturbance near the surface both have an impact on reducing bacterial attachment. To add to this finding, it is still important for science to consider and conduct research on the novel strategy of using surfaces that mimic biological systems to reduce biofouling and other alternative methods to develop sustainable technology.},

	abstract = {Unimpeded transfer and spread of invasive species throughout freshwater systems is of global concern, altering species compositions, disrupting ecosystem processes, and diverting economic resources. The magnitude and complexity of the problem is amplified by the global connectedness of human movements and the multiple modes of inter-basin transport of aquatic invasive species. Our objective was to trace the fishing behavior of anglers delineating potential pathways of transfer of invasive species throughout the vast inland waters of the Great Lakes of North America, which contain more than 21\% of the world’s surface freshwater and are among the most highly invaded aquatic ecosystems in the world. Combining a comprehensive survey and a spatial analysis of the movements of thousands of anglers in 12 states within the US portion of the Great Lakes Basin and the Upper Mississippi and Ohio River Basins, we estimated that 6.5 million licensed anglers in the study area embarked on an average of 30 fishing trips over the course of the year, and 70\% of the individuals fished in more than one county. Geospatial linkages showed direct connections made by individuals traveling between 99\% of the 894 counties where fishing occurred, and between 61 of the 66 sub-watersheds in a year. Estimated numbers of fishing trips to individual counties ranged from 1199–1.95 million; generally highest in counties bordering the Great Lakes. Of these, 79 had more than 10,000 estimated fishing trips originating from anglers living in other counties. Although angler movements are one mechanism of invasive species transfer, there likely is a high cumulative probability of invasive species transport by several million people fishing each year throughout this extensive freshwater network. A comprehensive georeferenced survey, coupled with a spatial analysis of fishing destinations, provides a potentially powerful tool to track, predict, curtail and control the transfer and proliferation of invasive species in freshwater.},

Biofouling includes micro- (bacteria and unicellular algae) and macrofouling (mussels, barnacles, tube worms, bryozoans, etc.) and is a major problem for industries. However, the settlement and growth of some biofouling species, like oysters and corals, can be desirable. Thus, it is important to understand the process of biofouling in detail. Modern “omic” techniques, such as metabolomics, metagenomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, provide unique opportunities to study biofouling organisms and communities and investigate their metabolites and environmental interactions. In this review, we analyze the recent publications that employ metagenomic, metabolomic, and proteomic techniques for the investigation of biofouling and biofouling organisms. Specific emphasis is given to metagenomics, proteomics and publications using combinations of different “omics” techniques. Finally, this review presents the future outlook for the use of “omics” techniques in marine biofouling studies. Like all trans-disciplinary research, environmental “omics” is in its infancy and will advance rapidly as researchers develop the necessary expertise, theory, and technology.},

We measured planktonic zebra mussel veliger density and adult survivorship in San Justo Reservoir in central California to determine distribution and timing of spawning in relation to temperature and dissolved oxygen throughout winter, spring, and summer. We found seasonal patterns in adult survivorship, with high mortality late in the summer and higher than expected survivorship during the spring when dissolved oxygen concentrations were approximately 1 mg/L. Veliger abundance peaked several meters above the thermocline from June to August. Dissolved oxygen concentrations limited veliger distribution, with few to no veligers collected in the anoxic hypolimnion. Veliger settlement out of the water column appears to be possible in San Justo Reservoir at any time of year. A better understanding of how veligers, juveniles, and adult mussels respond to fluctuating dissolved oxygen and temperature conditions will further knowledge of timing and duration of water drawdowns or other control methods for managing this harmful invasive species.},

In this work, we consider the potential effects of internal guidelines and policies designed to prevent the spread of invasive species by the field activities of management institutions and their partners. Such policies could be high-leverage tools for invasive species prevention, however, as large, complex organizations seek to implement policies to limit the spread of invasive species, it may be challenging to accommodate the wide diversity of potential invasion pathways and mitigation efforts facilitated via the programs, activities, and ecosystems they manage. Prevention policies may also be met with resistance due to the costs of implementation unless concrete benefits can be demonstrated. Assessing and communicating the effects of prevention policies could motivate improved implementation and adherence by institutional units and partners and could help inform adaptive policy changes. However, assessing the effectiveness of invasive species prevention presents a unique set of challenges, including incomplete data on invasive species distribution and pathways, that make it difficult to measure the effects of prevention efforts. In this work, we present a conceptual framework for evaluating institutional policies for invasive species prevention. We describe a flexible, multifaceted approach that considers policy implementation and adherence as well as ecological outcomes. We discuss potential application of this framework using a policy recently implemented by the Pacific Region of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to prevent the introduction and spread of invasive species by service personnel and partners during field activities as a case study.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0287582},
	abstract = {Background 
The environmental prevalence of widely prescribed human pharmaceuticals that target key evolutionary conserved biomolecules present across phyla is concerning. Antidepressants, one of the most widely consumed pharmaceuticals globally, have been developed to target biomolecules modulating monoaminergic neurotransmission, thus interfering with the endogenous regulation of multiple key neurophysiological processes. Furthermore, rising prescription and consumption rates of antidepressants caused by the burgeoning incidence of depression is consistent with increasing reports of antidepressant detection in aquatic environments worldwide. Consequently, there are growing concerns that long-term exposure to environmental levels of antidepressants may cause adverse drug target-specific effects on non-target aquatic organisms. While these concerns have resulted in a considerable body of research addressing a range of toxicological endpoints, drug target-specific effects of environmental levels of different classes of antidepressants in non-target aquatic organisms remain to be understood. Interestingly, evidence suggests that molluscs may be more vulnerable to the effects of antidepressants than any other animal phylum, making them invaluable in understanding the effects of antidepressants on wildlife. Here, a protocol for the systematic review of literature to understand drug target-specific effects of environmental levels of different classes of antidepressants on aquatic molluscs is described. The study will provide critical insight needed to understand and characterize effects of antidepressants relevant to regulatory risk assessment decision-making, and/or direct future research efforts.
Methods
The systematic review will be conducted in line with the guidelines by the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence (CEE). A literature search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, as well as grey literature databases, will be carried out. Using predefined criteria, study selection, critical appraisal and data extraction will be done by multiple reviewers with a web-based evidence synthesis platform. A narrative synthesis of outcomes of selected studies will be presented. The protocol has been registered in the Open Science Framework (OSF) registry with the registration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/P4H8W.},

In this study, we observed the microscopic morphology of abalone abdominal foot surface, and found that the surface was covered with a large number of fibers. Then five types of force measuring plates were designed and processed for the adhesion test of abalone abdominal foot. According to the test results, the composition of abalone abdominal foot adhesion force was analyzed and the proportion of various adhesion force to the total adhesion force of abalone abdominal foot was calculated. Among them, the vacuum adhesion force accounts for more than half of the total adhesion force of abalone abdominal foot, and its proportion is more than 60\%. Van der Waals force also plays an important role, and its proportion is more than 20\%. The proportion of capillary force is very small, which is only about 1\%. Its main role is to form a liquid film to prevent the gas from flowing into the sucker. The vacuum adhesion of abalone abdominal foot can be further divided into the whole adhesion of abdominal foot, the local adhesion of abdominal foot and the frictional equivalent vacuum adhesion. And the whole adhesion of abdominal foot is basically equivalent to the local adhesion of abdominal foot. This study quantifies the proportion of various adhesion forces to the total adhesion force of the abdominal foot, which provides a reference for the further study of other adhesive creatures and the design of bionic underwater adhesion devices.},

	abstract = {The infamous “master manipulators”—intracellular bacteria of the genus Wolbachia—infect a broad range of phylogenetically diverse invertebrate hosts in terrestrial ecosystems. Wolbachia has an important impact on the ecology and evolution of their host with documented effects including induced parthenogenesis, male killing, feminization, and cytoplasmic incompatibility. Nonetheless, data on Wolbachia infections in non-terrestrial invertebrates are scarce. Sampling bias and methodological limitations are some of the reasons limiting the detection of these bacteria in aquatic organisms. In this study, we present a new metagenetic method for detecting the co-occurrence of different Wolbachia strains in freshwater invertebrates host species, i.e., freshwater Arthropoda (Crustacea), Mollusca (Bivalvia), and water bears (Tardigrada) by applying NGS primers designed by us and a Python script that allows the identification of Wolbachia target sequences from the microbiome communities. We also compare the results obtained using the commonly applied NGS primers and the Sanger sequencing approach. Finally, we describe three supergroups of Wolbachia: (i) a new supergroup V identified in Crustacea and Bivalvia hosts; (ii) supergroup A identified in Crustacea, Bivalvia, and Eutardigrada hosts, and (iii) supergroup E infection in the Crustacea host microbiome community.},

Despite being considered as a global problem, only a small number of studies have quantitatively predicted the food web-level consequences of invasions. Here, we use an allometric trophic network model parameterized using empirical data on species body masses and feeding interactions to predict the effects of a possible invasion of Amur sleeper (Perccottus glenii), on a well-studied lake ecosystem. We show that the modeled establishment of Amur sleeper decreased the biomasses of top predator fishes by about 10\%–19\%. These reductions were largely explained by increased larval competition for food and Amur sleeper predation on fish larvae. In contrast, biomasses of less valued fish of lower trophic positions increased by about 0.4\%–9\% owing to reduced predation pressure by top piscivores. The predicted impact of Amur sleeper establishment on the biomasses of native fish species vastly exceeded the impacts of current-day fishing pressures.},

	doi = {10.3389/fmars.2023.1049181},
	abstract = {We combine historical and recent monitoring data with modeling to get a better insight into water quality development of the large Oder/Szczecin Lagoon and especially the role of macrophytes. Data indicates that the system is eutrophic for centuries and a naturally eutrophic system. During the last decades, external nutrient loads decreased but keep the system in a eutrophic state. The systems primary production is limited by light and nitrogen and cannot be sufficiently managed by external nutrient load reductions. We consider 36\% macrophyte coverage of the lagoon area as potential historical maximum. Despite its shallowness the lagoon was never a macrophyte dominated, clear water system. About 31\% of the lagoon area would be covered by macrophytes in a good ecological status according to the Water Framework Directive. However, the existing water transparency targets seem too ambitious and not realistic. Changes in macrophyte coverage on water quality are restricted to near shore areas and hardly affect the open lagoon. Existing models require an improved representation of water transparency and effects on macrophyte colonization depth. Presently the patchy macrophyte coverage is only about 12\% of the lagoon area. This low coverage and a relatively poor species composition results in a non-satisfactory state classification. However, ecologically valuable angiosperms and charophytes seem to recover. A strict avoidance of mechanical disturbances could be a measure to support macrophyte re-colonization. A systematic improvement of piscivorous fish stocks may be a supporting measure to reduce eutrophication. Restoration perspectives and consequences for environmental policies are discussed.},

	abstract = {In this paper, I selected Sinonovacula constricta, a typical representative of commercial bivalve shellfishes from Zhangzhou city, and found that microplastics were detected in all the samples with small size. The abundance in farm samples (3.65 n/g) was higher than in market (0.89 n/g), despite their smaller weight, which were mainly contributed by body fluid. Microplastics transported from the body fluid to the viscera and then metabolized into muscle were substantially reduced (69.3\%), only 0 or 1 microplastics observed in the muscles on the micron scale. The microplastics detected in the market samples were mainly concentrated in the viscera, accounting for 81\%, while distributed in all the organs of farm samples, with body fluids the most accounting for 52\%. A total of four shapes were detected, with the highest percentage of fibrous shape, while foam-like microplastics were not detected in the market samples. The abundance was not correlated with sample weight, but market samples showed positive correlation. A total of seven polymers were detected, with the highest rate of PP (27\%). The polymer risk level reached level III. The percentage of PVC in the market samples exceeded that of farms, which resulted in a higher hazard risk index despite their lower abundance. The cleaning process and excretory behavior, from farm to market seafood pond, greatly reduced microplastic contamination and the risk. This paper can provide some baseline for the study of microplastic characteristics of bivalve shellfish, and decision making on plastic management from aquaculture farm to market, especially for seafood security.},

	abstract = {Freshwater mussels (family Unionidae) are among the world's most endangered taxa, with almost 75\% of North American taxa classified as a species of concern, threatened, or endangered. Despite the critical importance of comprehensive distributional data for the conservation of unionids and fishes, these data are often lacking because of the labor and resources associated with traditional survey methods. During their larval stage, unionid mussels use various fish species as obligate hosts, making native fish species vital to unionid persistence and an understanding of host distribution similarly important. Here, we utilized an eDNA metabarcoding approach to evaluate patterns of co-distribution of unionid mussels and fishes along {\textasciitilde}362 km of the densely sampled Grand River network as well as the outlets of 19 tributaries along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, USA. We detected a total of 21 mussel and 40 fish taxa, with distinctive composition of both mussel and fish assemblages across tributaries and differences in fish taxa between sampling periods. Notably, we detected more mussel taxa within the Grand River watershed than at the outlets of all 20 rivers combined. Within the Grand River network, two fish taxa (Pylodictus olivaris and Cyprinella) were found more frequently in areas of high mussel diversity, and three fish taxa more frequently in areas of low mussel diversity (Umbra, Leuciscidae, and Etheostoma). There was little difference between eDNA detections of mussels from samples collected in June versus August, but we detected significantly more fish taxa in August compared to June. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the value of eDNA metabarcoding for evaluating co-distribution of ecologically connected taxa. The use of eDNA as a tool for determining distributions of mussels and their obligate hosts may facilitate conservation efforts for these imperiled taxa.},

In traditional approaches, it is considered that the extinction of species with high centrality poses the greatest threat to secondary extinction. However, the indirect effect, which is equally important as the local and direct effects, is not included. Here, we propose an optimized disintegration strategy model for quantitative food webs and introduced tabu search, a metaheuristic optimization algorithm, to identify keystone species. Topological simulations are used to record secondary extinctions during species removal and secondary extinction areas, as well as to evaluate food web robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is also validated by comparing it with traditional methods. Results of our experiments demonstrate that our strategy can optimize the effect of food web disintegration and identify the species whose extinction is most destructive to the food web through global search. The algorithm provides an innovative and efficient way for further development of keystone species identification in the ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Consumer-resource population models drive progress in predicting and understanding predation. However, they are often built by averaging the foraging outcomes of individuals to estimate per capita functional responses (functions that describe predation rate). Reliance on per-capita functional responses rests on the assumption that that individuals forage independently without affecting each other. Undermining this assumption, extensive behavioral neuroscience research has made clear that facilitative and antagonistic interactions among conspecifics frequently alter foraging through interference competition and persistent neurophysiological changes. For example, repeated social defeats dysregulates rodent hypothalamic signaling, modulating appetite. In behavioral ecology, similar mechanisms are studied under the concept of dominance hierarchies. Neurological and behavioral changes in response to conspecifics undoubtedly play some sort of role in the foraging of populations, but modern predator-prey theory does not explicitly include them. Here we describe how some modern approaches to population modeling might account for this. Further, we propose that spatial predator-prey models can be modified to describe plastic changes in foraging behavior driven by intraspecific interaction, namely individuals switching between patches or plastic strategies to avoid competition. Extensive neurological and behavioral ecology research suggests that interactions among conspecifics help shape populations’ functional responses. Modeling interdependent functional responses woven together by behavioral and neurological mechanisms may thus be indispensable in predicting the outcome of consumer-resource interactions across systems.},

Here we report the first record of Sinanodonta lauta (Martens, 1877) from Iran and provide morphological and molecular data on this alien population. This species was observed in the Dez River and a fish farm in Khuzestan, south of Iran. The S. lauta introduction seems to be closely related to the introduction of Asian carps from East Asia. The individuals collected from the river exhibited two COI haplotypes, probably due to several introduction events of host fish. Based on our haplotype network, the alien individuals found in Iran is closer to the native ones from South Korea (two-three substitutions) compared to other native individuals reported from Japan and Russian Far East. The presence of 10-11 years old specimens in Dez River shows that the species can survive well in the natural environment of southern Iran. Further expansion and colonization of S. lauta in south Iran or beyond it are not unexpected due to some human-mediated dispersal events as well as waterways in the region.},

	abstract = {Gut content analyses have found that round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) are highly dependent on dreissenid mussels but stable isotope analysis has often suggested that the dreissenid contribution is lower. However, estimation of dietary contributions with stable isotopes relies on accurate discrimination factors (fractionation factors). To test if discrimination values commonly used in aquatic food web studies are suitable for round gobies, we collected round gobies from Oneida Lake, raised them for 63 days under four different diets (Chironomus plumosus, Mytilus chilensis, Dreissenia spp., Euphausia superba) and measured the change in white muscle δ13C and δ15N. Gobies were also collected throughout Oneida Lake for gut content and stable isotope analysis. Diets changed as round gobies grew, with small round gobies (17-42mm) feeding mostly on cladocera and chironomids, intermediate sized gobies (43-94mm) transitioning from chironomid to dreissenid consumption, and larger gobies (95-120mm) predominantly consuming dreissenids, similar to findings in other studies. Discrimination factors were obtained by fitting a commonly used asymptotic regression equation describing changes in fish δ13C and δ15N as a function of time and diet stable isotope ratios. The discrimination factor determined for δ13C (-0.4‰ ± 0.32, SE) was lower than the “standard” value of 0.4‰, while that of δ15N (4.0‰ ± 0.32, SE) was higher than the standard value of 3.4‰. Turnover rates for both δ13C and δ15N were estimated as 0.02 ‰*day-1. The use of experimentally determined discrimination factors rather than “standard” values resulted in model estimates that agree more closely with the observed increasing importance of dreissenids in gut content of larger gobies. Our results suggest that the importance of dreissenid mussels inferred from stable isotope studies may be underestimated when using standard isotopic discrimination values.},

	abstract = {Many marine invertebrates have planktonic larval and benthic juvenile/adult stages. When the planktonic larvae are fully developed, they must find a favorable site to settle and metamorphose into benthic juveniles. This transition from a planktonic to a benthic mode of life is a complex behavioral process involving substrate searching and exploration. Although the mechanosensitive receptor in the tactile sensor has been implicated in sensing and responding to surfaces of the substrates, few have been unambiguously identified. Recently, we identified that the mechanosensitive transient receptor potential melastatin-subfamily member 7 (TRPM7) channel, highly expressed in the larval foot of the mussel Mytilospsis sallei, was involved in substrate exploration for settlement. Here, we show that the TRPM7-mediated Ca2+ signal was involved in triggering the larval settlement of M. sallei through the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β/AMP-activated protein kinase/silk gland factor 1 (CaMKKβ-AMPK-SGF1) pathway. It was found that M. sallei larvae preferred the stiff surfaces for settlement, on which TRPM7, CaMKKβ, AMPK, and SGF1 were highly expressed. These findings will help us to better understand the molecular mechanisms of larval settlement in marine invertebrates, and will provide insights into the potential targets for developing environmentally friendly antifouling coatings for fouling organisms.},

Biotic indices included in the WFD and bacteriological parameters in terms of human health were also evaluated for these lakes. Sampling was performed at 6 stations in 2018-2019. Results for the zoobenthic community structure indicate that Lake İznik has started to become organically polluted and Lake Manyas is more polluted. Also, the biological index results for Lake İznik also show that the lake water quality has started to decrease and that pollution conditions have occurred, pointing to class III water quality. It is clear that there is pollution pressure in Lake İznik. However, according to the results, the macrozoobenthic community structure, diversity, and water quality of Lake İznik seem to be better than those of Lake Manyas.

	abstract = {Species detection using environmental DNA (eDNA) is a biomonitoring tool that can be widely applied to mangrove restoration and management. Compared to traditional surveys that are taxa-specific and time-consuming, eDNA metabarcoding offers a rapid, non-invasive and cost-efficient method for monitoring mangrove biodiversity and characterising the spatio-temporal distribution of multiple taxa simultaneously. General guidelines for eDNA metabarcoding are well-established for aquatic systems, but habitat-specific guidelines are still lacking. Mangrove habitats, as priority ecosystems for restoration in Southeast Asia, present unique prospects and challenges in these regards. Environmental DNA metabarcoding can be used to (1) track functional recovery in ecological restoration, (2) prioritise conservation areas, (3) provide early warning for threats, (4) monitor threatened taxa, (5) monitor response to climate change, and (6) support community-based restoration. However, these potential applications have yet been realized in Southeast Asia due to (1) technical challenges, (2) lack of standardised methods, (3) spatio-temporal difficulties in defining community, (4) data limitations, and (5) lack of funding, infrastructure and technical capacity. Successful implementation of eDNA metabarcoding in mangrove restoration activities would encourage the development of data-driven coastal management and equitable conservation programs. Eventually, this would promote Southeast Asia’s shared regional interests in food security, coastal defence and biodiversity conservation.},

We also predicted that the relative strength of such fish-mediated habitat linkages would vary depending on physical connectivity across habitats. We collected perch and potential prey resources from seven paired coastal wetland–nearshore sites across three regions of Lake Michigan and quantified resource and habitat use with Bayesian stable isotope mixing models and otolith microchemistry. We found that juvenile perch collected in nearshore habitats showed high use of wetland resources, and that diets of wetland-collected juveniles typically contained a smaller proportion of nearshore resources than did more mobile adults from the same wetland. The least hydrologically connected sites had lower cross-habitat resource use (e.g., wetland-collected perch consumed fewer nearshore resources and vice versa) compared with sites with greater levels of hydrological connectivity. Otolith microchemistry confirmed the linkages revealed by stable isotopes, suggesting that a dual approach can increase understanding of habitat linkages in large lakes. Quantifying the importance of multiple lentic habitats (i.e., “lakescape connectivity”) for fisheries production is critical for developing comprehensive large lake food web models and providing managers with information to prioritize locations for conservation and restoration.},

To assist enforcement agencies in identifying species either intentionally (trafficked) or unintentionally (stowaway) entrained in the trade-chain pathway, rapid forensic techniques are needed to enable their detection from DNA samples when physical identification is not possible. Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) is an emerging technique, with recent applications in biosecurity and forensic sciences, which has potential to function as a field-based detection tool. Here we provide an overview of current research that applies LAMP to environmental biosecurity, including identification of ornamental wildlife parts, consumer products, and invasive species monitoring and biosecurity detection. We discuss the current scope of LAMP as applied to various wildlife trade scenarios and biosecurity checkpoint monitoring, highlight the specificity, sensitivity, and robustness for these applications, and review the potential utility of LAMP for rapid field-based detection at biosecurity checkpoints. Based on our assessment of the literature we recommend broader interest, research uptake, and investment in LAMP as an appropriate field-based species detection method for a wide range of environmental biosecurity scenarios.},

	abstract = {Northern Eurasia is extensive and includes terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems that cover several natural zones and access to the seas of three oceans. As a result, it has been invaded by numerous invasive alien species (IAS) over large temporal and spatial scales. The purpose of this research was to assess invasion trends and construct species distribution models for the Russian TOP-100 most dangerous IAS. Environmentally suitable regions for IAS were established based on alien species attribute databases, datasets of 169,709 species occurrence records (SOR) and raster layers of environmental variables using species distribution modelling (MaxEnt). The objectives of this research were to (1) create databases of SOR for the TOP-100 IAS in Russia; 2) determine pathways, residence time, donor regions and trends of invasions; (3) determine the main types of spatial distributions of invasive species and their relation to residence time; and (4) distinguish regions with the highest richness of IAS that have a strong impact on the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of Russia. We found that although species invasions date back over 400 years, the number of naturalized IAS has increased non-linearly over the past 76 years. The TOP-100 list is mainly represented by unintentionally introduced species (62\%) which are characterized by different introduction pathways. Species occurrence records revealed that 56 IAS are distributed locally, 26 are distributed regionally and 18 are widespread in Russia. Species with local, regional or widespread distributions were characterized by residence times of 55, 126 or 190 years, respectively. We found that IAS with local distribution can expand their range into suitable regions more extensively (expected increase by 32\%) than widespread species (expected increase by only 7\%). The procedure of identifying hot/cold spots locations based on SOR allowed us to identify the Russian regions with the highest richness of IAS. Our results and the integrated database that we created provide a framework for studying IAS over large temporal and spatial scales that can be used in the development of management plans for dangerous IAS.},

In temperate lakes, fishes with different thermal optima can become spatially segregated during summer stratification. This habitat partitioning, or niche complementarity, may play a role in the coexistence of trophically similar species; however, the extent of partitioning is dependent on the resources available within each habitat. Although habitat partitioning of fish thermal guilds has been studied in individual lakes, broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap and segregation are not yet understood. In this study, we explore the patterns and drivers of spatial overlap among thermal guilds (cold-, cool-, and warm-water) at a broad scale.LocationOntario, Canada.MethodsWe built a multivariate regression tree to explore patterns and environmental drivers of spatial overlap in freshwater fishes across three thermal guilds from 438 lakes.ResultsWe identified five clusters of lakes exhibiting different patterns of spatial overlap among the three thermal guilds. Temperature (growing degree days) and maximum lake depth were strong drivers of the spatial overlap patterns.Main ConclusionsThese findings provide a better understanding of broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap and allow us to predict how spatial overlap, and ultimately species interactions and competition, may change under a warming climate.},

	abstract = {Non-native species have the potential to cause ecological and economic harm to coastal and estuarine ecosystems. Understanding which habitat types are most vulnerable to biological invasions, where invasions originate, and the vectors by which they arrive can help direct limited resources to prevent or mitigate ecological and socio-economic harm. Information about the occurrence of non-native species can help guide interventions at all stages of invasion, from first introduction, to naturalization and invasion. However, monitoring at relevant scales requires considerable investment of time, resources, and taxonomic expertise. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding methods sample coastal ecosystems at broad spatial and temporal scales to augment established monitoring methods. We use COI mtDNA eDNA sampling to survey a diverse assemblage of species across distinct habitats in the Salish Sea in Washington State, USA, and classify each as non-native, native, or indeterminate in origin. The non-native species detected include both well-documented invaders and species not previously reported within the Salish Sea. We find a non-native assemblage dominated by shellfish and algae with native ranges in the temperate western Pacific, and find more-retentive estuarine habitats to be invaded at far higher levels than better-flushed rocky shores. Furthermore, we find an increase in invasion level with higher water temperatures in spring and summer across habitat types. This analysis contributes to a growing understanding of the biotic and abiotic factors that influence invasion level, and underscores the utility of eDNA surveys to monitor biological invasions and to better understand the factors that drive these invasions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Much like the response to naturally occurring physical, chemical, and biological variables controlling phytoplankton dynamics, anthropogenic modification to those variables may have profound implications on phytoplankton density and community structure in aquatic systems. We theorized that extensive land use and river channel modifications would result in (1) an increase in basin-wide phytoplankton density in the Middle Missouri River Basin (MMRB), and (2) a shift in community structure within and downstream of reservoirs filled after 1950 by examining data collected from 2020 and 2021 across the Middle Missouri River Basin to data collected in 1950. Our results suggest that system-wide increases in algal cell density were uncommon, yet variable with only two systems showing increases with high confidence and one showing a decrease. Some systems like the Missouri River reservoir sites and the James River showed an interannual shift in dominant phytoplankton genera, while other systems shared at least one dominant genus in 1950, 2020, and 2021. Our results suggest that despite modifications to land and water use, changes in phytoplankton density and community structure are clear but not consistent across the MMRB. Chlorophyll has been used extensively in ecological monitoring as a proxy for phytoplankton density or biovolume due to the relative simplicity of processing samples. We regressed the predictor variable of total chlorophyll and response variable of algal cell density as well as the predictor variable of log10 transformed Secchi depth (Secchi) and the response variables of either total chlorophyll or algal cell density from 161 samples across nine rivers of the MMRB. A positive relationship was observed between chlorophyll and algal cell density, while an inverse relationship was observed between Secchi and either chlorophyll or algal cell density. These findings suggest that using chlorophyll as a proxy for algal cell enumeration may provide an option to monitor phytoplankton dynamics in rivers. High suspended sediment loads may have confounded the relationship between Secchi and either chlorophyll or algal cell density. Chlorophyll determined by in vivo fluorescence provides a good proxy to rapidly monitor phytoplankton dynamics in lowland rivers.},

	abstract = {Agricultural disturbances can have considerable negative effects on the biodiversity of surrounding environments. Pesticides have been detected in an overwhelming majority of streams that have been impacted by agriculture in the United States. Atrazine, a chlorotriazine herbicide, is one of the most extensively used pesticides. Atrazine inhibits photosynthesis by interfering with electron transfer and is capable of causing adverse effects in non-target, non-photosynthetic organisms. Few studies have examined how regional dynamics influence zooplankton community response and recovery to herbicide exposure. To do this, we sought to examine the effects of atrazine at individual, community, and metacommunity scales. Metacommunities are defined as a set of local communities that are linked regionally by dispersal of interacting species. First, we examined the effects of atrazine on individual cladocerans with laboratory life-table experiments to determine the lowest observed effect concentrations (LOEC) for atrazine at environmentally relevant concentrations. Second, we observed the effects of regional dispersal on local communities that were affected by atrazine and/or phosphorus. Phosphorus was added to the experiment because surrounding ecosystems can also receive agricultural inputs of fertilizers during rainfall events that may act to mitigate atrazine’s effect on phytoplankton. Third, we constructed metacommunities that represented different proportions of heterogeneity from completely undisturbed to fully disturbed with all three mesocosms exposed to atrazine. Individually, atrazine impacted reproduction, size, and male production in several of the species at environmentally relevant concentrations. Among our species, Daphnia magna was the most sensitive with an atrazine LOEC of 30 µg/L. At the community level, atrazine tended to reduce total zooplankton abundance while phosphorus tended to increase it. However, dispersal helped to increase local zooplankton abundances and likely promoted regional diversity through species sorting and source-sink dynamics. Connectivity, between local and regional scales, within the metacommunity design created similarity between the metacommunity treatments that included disturbed mesocosms. Metacommunities, through dispersal and spatial insurance, tended to curtail the loss of regional species relative to undisturbed and isolated mesocosms. Combined, these chapters highlight the need to include metacommunity dynamics into understanding disturbances on zooplankton communities.},

The paper summarizes all the available literature data, field research and information obtained during the review of the collection of malacological material of the Natural History Museum in Belgrade. The results show a positive population trend, which is reflected in an extension of the distribution area and an increase in population density. After reviewing the museum collection, 13 synonyms for U. crassus were identified. The study also revealed a better insight into the habitat requirements and the limiting factors of the species. Substrate characteristics, waterbody types, altitude, and nitrate content of the water seem to be of great importance for the occurrence of the species. The results presented here can improve further measures for the conservation of U. crassus, not only in Serbia, but also in the Western Balkans.},

	abstract = {The biofouling of marine structures must be controlled if crippling operational and maintenance costs are to be avoided and biological invasions prevented. However, traditional methods of biofouling control typically involve the use of toxic chemicals, which have their own drawbacks, both financial and environmental. For ships, the hull is the largest surface requiring a fouling-control coating; however, there are other so-called ‘niche’ areas (up to 10\% of the total wetted area) that typically cannot be, or are not routinely, treated to prevent biofouling accumulation. The use of UV light is a tried and tested sterilization method that has been shown to also work underwater. However, the speed with which UV can be applied to large-scale biofouling control will be determined by the engineering challenges involved and the lack of basic understanding of the biological mode of action. The former is essential for the effective translation of this established technology into a high-performance, industrially useful fouling-control system. The latter will be important for environmental regulation and safe use as well as performance optimisation. Here, we developed two bespoke flow-through systems to replicate ship niche areas and deployed them in Melbourne, Australia, and North East England. We demonstrated a 40–90\% reduction in biofouling coverage on silicone tiles embedded with UV-emitting LEDs, even as the LED output waned (after {\textasciitilde}8000 h). Image analysis and amplicon sequencing of 18S genes provided complementary information about the taxonomic composition of the fouling communities and highlighted some taxa, for example, ascidians and diatoms, which may have, or in the future develop, UV resistance. Interestingly, the UV treatment far exceeded performance estimates based on the predicted attenuation distance of UV in seawater. Overall, while it is clear that UV treatment works in terms of its efficacy against the vast majority of observed fouling species, technical challenges remain, as do knowledge gaps surrounding the biological and ecological effects of widespread use.},

The community composition of zooplankton has also been altered over the past 20 years in LM, shifting the summer dominance from cladoceran to calanoid taxa. However, most of our information on zooplankton community dynamics is from deeper pelagic zones. The nearshore beach (≤1 m) habitat, which serves as a critical nursery for some larvae and juvenile fish, is composed of different zooplankton taxa than deeper zones, but limited data are available for comparison. We conducted a standardized summer sampling campaign to characterize the zooplankton community across 32 beaches in LM. We found the lowest crustacean zooplankton density and biomass on northern LM beaches and a higher zooplankton density and biomass on Greater Green Bay and central LM beaches, which had warmer water temperatures. Smaller-bodied cladocera (mainly Bosmina) and cyclopoid taxa were the most abundant groups on beaches. Our results provide the first comprehensive characterization of zooplankton on beaches in the Great Lakes, with applications for other lake systems.

It is with this understanding that the current work discusses the physical and biological impacts that occur due to the oceanic environment in seaports, the existing policy provisions, and the possible ways ahead to reduce environmental deterioration and allow their sustainable operation, by means of reviewing published works.},

	abstract = {BackgroundRecently, two invasive Aedes mosquito species, Ae. japonicus and Ae. koreicus, are circulating in several European countries posing potential health risks to humans and animals. Vector control is the main option to prevent mosquito-borne diseases, and an accurate genome sequence of these mosquitoes is essential to better understand their biology and to develop effective control strategies.MethodsA de novo genome assembly of Ae. japonicus (Ajap1) and Ae. koreicus (Akor1) has been produced based on a hybrid approach that combines Oxford Nanopore long-read and Illumina short-read data. Their quality was ascertained using various metrics. Masking of repetitive elements, gene prediction and functional annotation was performed.ResultsSequence analysis revealed a very high presence of repetitive DNA and, among others, thermal adaptation genes and insecticide-resistance genes. Through the RNA-seq analysis of larvae and adults of Ae. koreicus and Ae. japonicus exposed to different temperatures, we also identified genes showing a differential temperature-dependent activation.ConclusionsThe assembly of Akor1 and Ajap1 genomes constitutes the first updated collective knowledge of the genomes of both mosquito species, providing the possibility of understanding key mechanisms of their biology such as the ability to adapt to harsh climates and to develop insecticide-resistance mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Ballast water is recognised as successfully transporting non-native (potentially) invasive alien species and other harmful organisms (human pathogens and toxic phytoplankton) from one region to another. Global warming enables the successful adaptation of non-native species in new areas. The early detection of harmful species increases the likelihood that the response will be effective and cause less damage to biodiversity, ecosystems, economies and human health. Scientific evidence strongly points to the importance of prevention. In this context, this refers to continuous port monitoring, carried out with the aim of detecting harmful species soon after their introduction. The objectives of rapid detection are (a) early warning and prevention of further spread of harmful species through ballast water or natural circulation, and (b) a timely response through eradication or other appropriate strategies to reduce the number or spatial extent of introduced species. This paper provides guidance for the development of ballast water management in ports based on a literature review. Available and new methods for identifying marine species and best practises in port monitoring for the early detection of harmful species, as well as early warning and response measures following the introduction of species in ports, are presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {One of the most important causes of biodiversity loss are non-indigenous species (NIS), in particular invasive ones. The dispersion of NIS mainly depends on anthropogenic activities such as maritime traffic, which account for almost half of the total NIS introduction in the European seas, as reported by the European Environmental Agency. For this reason, NIS management measures are mainly focused on commercial ports (i.e., ballast water management and Marine Strategy Framework Directive monitoring), underestimating the role of marinas and tourist harbors; these host small vessels ({\textless}20 m), such as recreational, fishery, and sail ones without ballast waters, but are also responsible for NIS arrival and spread through the bilge water as well as from hull fouling. With the aim of paying attention to marinas and tourist harbors and validating an innovative molecular methodology for NIS surveillance and monitoring, in the present work, eDNA metabarcoding of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) was applied to both bilge waters and adjacent ones to assess species composition and particularly NIS presence. A total of 140 OTUs/species with extra-Mediterranean distribution were found in the bilge samples; several of these are most likely ascribed to food contamination (e.g., Salmo salar). Excluding food contamination species, twelve of these found in the bilge waters were already known as NIS in the Mediterranean Sea, belonging to algae, mollusks, crustaceans, annelids, echinoderms, and fishes. Nine of these species are new to Italian waters. The results obtained in the present work support the importance of NIS monitoring in marinas and small harbors, particularly in the bilge waters, through eDNA metabarcoding, having detected several potential NIS that otherwise would not have been discovered.},

Bythotrephes longimanus Leydig, 1860 was first detected in Lake Champlain in August 2014, and Cercopagis pengoi (Ostroumov, 1891) was detected in August 2018. Monitoring for both invasive species at 15 lake sites using whole water tow sampling has been ongoing since 2010 with no detection of either species until 2014. Utilizing data from the Lake Champlain long-term monitoring program, we assessed pre- and post-invasion population dynamics of both invasive species on the native zooplankton community. Our results showed shifts in community structure following invasion, including a reduction in Diacyclops thomasi (Forbes, 1882) populations by both invaders and a reduction in Daphnia retrocurva Forbes, 1882 following the introduction of B. longimanus. Other cyclopoids, bosminids, and rotifers were also reduced, corresponding to both introduced species. The native large-bodied plankton predator Leptodora kindtii (Focke, 1844) appears to be unable to coexist with either invasive predatory cladoceran, displaying seasonal partitioning between L. kindtii and the Cercopagidae. These findings suggest that the invasion of both large predators in Lake Champlain have impacted pelagic zooplankton community structure.},

	abstract = {The global population is expected to reach 9.7 billion people by 2050. Therefore, sustainable intensification of the food system to support the increasing population under a changing climate is vital. Aquaculture is the fastest expanding food sector globally, but projections suggest this industry will be severely impacted by anthropogenically induced climate change in the coming decades. Genomic selection has been highlighted by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) as an avenue to ensure the aquaculture industry will thrive under future climatic conditions, fast-tracking breeding of specialised lines. Following this line of reasoning, the work in this thesis aimed to contribute to the advances in genomic breeding of marine molluscs, a highly sustainable source of animal protein. In the first chapter, I reviewed the existing literature on shellfish aquaculture, exploring how the current production systems and aquaculture practices may impact the genetic diversity of the produced stock and, consequently, the success of any proposed genomic breeding in these taxa, alongside identifying the main gaps in our current knowledge in this field. Subsequently, each experimental chapter of this thesis then addressed a separate gap in our current understanding. In chapter II, I developed a multispecies 60 K SNP-array applicable for genotyping four mussel species relevant for aquaculture: M. edulis, M. galloprovincialis, M. chilensis and M. trossulus. Following low-coverage whole genome sequencing of 138 mussels, {\textasciitilde}60K SNPs were implemented in the platform, from which 23,252 are applicable for genotyping M. edulis individuals, 22,165 for M. chilensis, 20,504 SNPs M. galloprovincialis and 20,149 for M. trossulus. This tool therefore represents a major advance in the current technological capability available in this species complex, and will allow researchers to explore the genetic diversity of mussels using a dense number of markers (on the scale of thousands), whilst producing comparable data among studies. It is also applicable for breeding purposes and may facilitate future implementation of genomic selection in these taxa. Subsequently, in chapter III, I applied this SNP-array to explore the genomic structure of blue mussels in South West England; an important area for mussel aquaculture and a region that has been key for our understanding of hybrid zone dynamics, between the species M. galloprovincialis and M. edulis, historically. Results from this chapter agree with the previous description of the hybrid zone, with M. galloprovincialis genotypes dominating the north coast of Cornwall whilst M. edulis is the prevailing species in the southern coast of SW England. Furthermore, the transition zone between the two species was located at Lizard Point. These results validate the utility of the SNP-array for determining speciation across a wide region, and update our knowledge in genotype distribution in this key hybrid zone. In the thesis’ fourth chapter, I explored how selection towards environmental resilience impacts the phenotypes and/or genotypes of blue mussels. For this, I compared the genetic diversity and performance of juvenile mussels exposed to a thermal stress event to those of individuals which did not faced it. Results from this chapter suggest that thermal resilience may impact the performance of mussels, as stressed individuals presented a lower dry tissue weight (g) than naïve ones. In addition, a shift towardsM. edulisgenotypes occurred in the selected cohort. With climate change expected to increase the average sea surface temperature of the ocean, results presented in this thesis shows that such changes may impact the genetic background of mussel spat in the Baltic Sea and possibly. Such results may also impact aquaculture production of this species. In the final chapter, I discuss how the research questions explored in this thesis advance our knowledge in marine bivalve genomics and how they may change the field by supporting the development and application of genomic approaches for breeding these taxa.},

Assembling trait data in a synthetic dataset enables comparison across species and lineages and identification of data gaps. We collated data from the primary literature, books, state and federal reports, theses and dissertations, and museum collections into a centralized dataset covering information on taxonomy, morphology, reproductive ecology and life history, fish hosts, habitats, thermal tolerance, geographic distribution, available genetic information, and conservation status.

	abstract = {The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is extensively used as a sentinel species for biosurveys of environmental contaminants in freshwater ecosystems and for ecotoxicological studies. However, its metabolome remains poorly understood, particularly in light of the potential molecular sexual dimorphism between its different tissues. From an ecotoxicological point of view, inter-sex and inter-organ differences in the metabolome suggest variability in responsiveness, which can influence the analysis and interpretation of data, particularly in the case where males and females would be analyzed indifferently. This study aimed to assess the extent to which the molecular fingerprints of functionally diverse tissues like the digestive glands, gonads, gills, and mantle of D. polymorpha can reveal tissue-specific molecular sexual dimorphism. We employed a non-targeted metabolomic approach using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry and revealed a significant sexual molecular dimorphism in the gonads, and to a lesser extent in the digestive glands, of D. polymorpha. Our results highlight the critical need to consider inter-sex differences in the metabolome of D. polymorpha to avoid confounding factors, particularly when investigating environmental effects on molecular regulation in the gonads, and to a lesser extent in the digestive glands.},

The loss of mussel biodiversity can negatively impact freshwater ecosystems such that understanding the mussel’s gut microbiome has been identified as a priority topic for developing conservation strategies. In this study, we determine whether ethanol-stored specimens of freshwater mussels can yield representative information about their gut microbiomes such that changes in the microbiome through time could potentially be determined from museum mussel collections. A short-term preservation experiment using the invasive clam Corbicula fluminea was used to validate the use of ethanol as a method for storing the bivalve microbiome, and the gut microbiomes of nine native mussel species that had been preserved in ethanol for between 2 and 9 years were assessed. We show that ethanol preservation is a valid storage method for bivalve specimens in terms of maintaining an effective sequencing depth and the richness of their gut bacterial assemblages and provide further insight into the gut microbiomes of the invasive clam C. fluminea and nine species of native mussels. From this, we identify a “core” genus of bacteria (Romboutsia) that is potentially common to all freshwater bivalve species studied. These findings support the potential use of ethanol-preserved museum specimens to examine patterns in the gut microbiomes of freshwater mussels over long periods.},

	abstract = {With the growing demand for aquatic products, aquaculture has become a prominent means of meeting this demand. However, the selection of suitable sites for aquaculture remains a key factor in the success of any aquaculture operation. While various methods exist for site selection, geographic information system (GIS)-based multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) methods have emerged as the most widely utilized approach to identifying potential aquaculture sites. Following the guidelines of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA), this paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of GIS-based MCE methods used in aquaculture sites selection. The objective of this study is to offer a comprehensive overview of existing research in this field and develop a general model for selecting sites for fish and shellfish aquaculture. The main findings indicate a growing number of studies utilizing GIS-based MCE in aquaculture site selection in recent years, with Asia being the leading continent in terms of publications in this domain. Among the journals publishing in this field, the Aquaculture journal stands out as the top publisher. Using consistent criteria across the reviewed studies, two models have been generated, each consisting of four sub-models: water quality, soil quality, infrastructure, and socioeconomic factors; and topography, environment, and physical parameters. These models can aid future researchers and assist decision-makers in identifying optimal locations for aquaculture development.},

	abstract = {Palmer Amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri, Amaranthaceae) is one of the most competitive, troublesome, and noxious weeds causing significant yield reductions in various crops. A. palmeri was also a herbicide-resistant weed causing a serious eco-environmental problem. Given that the process of invasion is dynamic, the A. plamer invasion may already be quite severe where invasive species management and surveys are chronically lacking. Predicting the potential habitat of A. palmeri can help to develop effective measures for early warning and long-term detection. However, the invasive history and distribution patterns of A. palmeri in China remain largely unknown. Here, the invasive history and distribution patterns of A. palmeri from 1985 to 2022 in China were reconstructed, and then the potential geographical distribution of A. palmeri was predicted under current and future climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5) using the optimal MaxEnt model (V 3.4.4) and ArcGIS 10.8.2. The mean AUC values of A. palmeri were 0.967. Under the current climate conditions, the suitable habitat areas for A. palmeri reached 1,067,000 km2 in China and were mainly distributed in north and central China. Under the future scenarios, the highly suitable habitats were mainly distributed in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. Under SSP2–4.5, the future suitable areas will reach the maximum and expand to 1,411,100 km2 in the 2060s. The centroid distribution would northwestward extend under future climate scenarios. The human footprint index, mean temperature of the warmest quarter (Bio\_10), April wind speed (Wind\_4), temperature seasonality (standard deviation × 100) (bio\_4), topsoil gravel content (T\_gravel), and precipitation of warmest quarter (Bio\_18) were key environmental variables affecting distribution and growth of A. palmeri. Climate change would increase the risk of A. palmeri expanding to high latitudes. Our results will help in developing effective strategies for the early warning, prevention, control, and management of A. palmeri in China.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryLimnoperna fortunei, known as the golden mussel, is an invasive bivalve in South America responsible for economic damages in hydroelectric plants due to its ability to attach and grow on the walls of water pipes and tubes. Chemical compounds are often used to control golden mussel infestations in water systems. Here, we investigated the effects of two biocides—MXD-100 ™ and sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC)—through the assessment of morphological and gene-expression alterations in the gills. Both biocides were able to modulate the expression of defensive genes and morphological changes. Yet, it seems that NaDCC needs continuous exposure to control golden mussel infestation, whereas MXD-100™ can inflict severe damage to the mussels in as little as 24 h. Our results can be used to enhance control strategies for managing mussel growth in water systems, simultaneously reducing the environmental impact associated with costly and harmful chemical releases.AbstractLimnoperna fortunei, the golden mussel, is a bivalve mollusk considered an invader in South America. This species is responsible for ecological and economic damages due to its voluminous fouling capability. Chemical biocides such as MXD-100™ and sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) are often used to control L. fortunei infestations in hydraulic systems. Thus, we proposed to investigate the effects of different periods (24, 48 and 72 h) of exposure to MXD-100™ (0.56 mg L−1) and NaDCC (1.5 mg L−1) on the gills of L. fortunei through morphological and molecular analyses. NaDCC promoted progressive morphological changes during the analyzed periods and only an upregulation of SOD and HSP70 expression during the first 24 h of exposure. MXD-100™ led to severe morphological changes from the first period of exposure, in addition to an upregulation of SOD, CAT, HSP70 and CYP expression during the first 24 h. In contrast, MXD-100™ led to a downregulation of CAT transcription between 24 and 48 h. In static conditions, NaDCC causes lethal damage after 72 h of exposure, and that exposure needs to be continuous to achieve the control of the species. Meanwhile, the MXD-100™ treatment presented several effects during the first 24 h, showing acute toxicity in a shorter period of time.},

	abstract = {Oxalis latifolia, a perennial herbaceous weed, is a highly invasive species that poses a threat to agricultural lands worldwide. East Asia is under a high risk of invasion of O. latifolia under global climate change. To evaluate this risk, we employed maximum entropy modeling considering two shared socio-economic pathways (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). Currently, a small portion (8.02\%) of East Asia is within the O. latifolia distribution, with the highest coverages in Chinese Taipei, China, and Japan (95.09\%, 9.8\%, and 0.24\%, respectively). However, our projections indicated that this invasive weed will likely be introduced to South Korea and North Korea between 2041 and 2060 and 2081 and 2100, respectively. The species is expected to cover approximately 9.79\% and 23.68\% (SSP2-4.5) and 11.60\% and 27.41\% (SSP5-8.5) of the total land surface in East Asia by these time points, respectively. South Korea and Japan will be particularly susceptible, with O. latifolia potentially invading up to 80.73\% of their territory by 2081–2100. Mongolia is projected to remain unaffected. This study underscores the urgent need for effective management strategies and careful planning to prevent the introduction and limit the expansion of O. latifolia in East Asian countries.},

The use of a triadic approach (bioaccumulation, bioassay, and physiological biomarkers) has been shown to have good applicability for the comparative assessment of the environmental state of the Neva Estuary (Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea). The novelty of the methodological approach of the study was that it involved both active and passive bio-monitoring methods for assessing the quality of estuarine environment. The classical analyses of metal concentration in bottom sediments, in field biota (fish and molluscs), and in caged molluscs were accompanied by a bioassay of sediment toxicity using amphipods. The physiological state of molluscs kept in cages was assessed according to two functional characteristics, such as cardio-tolerance and metabolic activity (oxygen consumption rate), after exposition in cages. The method of active monitoring (caging exposure with molluscs) as a measurement of parameters in clean molluscs has proven itself well in controlling the accumulation of both metals and oil products. Macroalgae that are abundant in estuarine ecosystems are also good indicators of metals, at least showing the transition from bottom sediments to the next level of food webs. Unionid molluscs were found to be a more sensitive and effective indicator of contaminant accumulation than dreissenid molluscs, characterized by a low tolerance to changeable environmental conditions in the estuarine ecosystem and rather high mortality in cages. Our results have shown that caging exposure with unionids can be a widely used methodological approach for the assessment of estuarine environmental quality through the determination of metal concentrations in molluscs and their physiological state.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryAn in-depth study of the feeding habits characterizing bioinvaders may provide key information on the magnitude of their impacts on recipient communities. Specifically, if invaders’ trophic niche is superimposed on that of native species, interspecific competition may increase, resulting in negative consequences for the competing species; alternatively, trophic niche divergence may occur, facilitating the invaders’ integration into the community. In the present study, the analysis of carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes was used to investigate the trophic overlap of native and non-indigenous consumers. We found a generally low degree of isotopic overlap in both the invertebrate and fish assemblage, a condition that may facilitate coexistence and, in turn, limit the strength of invaders’ impact. The only exception was the Louisiana crayfish Procambarus clarkii, which was demonstrated to interact with a wide spectrum of native invertebrate species, confirming the necessity of guaranteeing appropriate measures of control and mitigation of its ecological impacts.AbstractAn advanced characterization of the trophic niche of non-indigenous species (NIS) may provide useful information on their ecological impact on invaded communities. Here, we used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to estimate pairwise niche overlaps between non-indigenous and native consumers in the winter food web of Lake Trasimeno (central Italy). Overall, a relatively low pairwise overlap of isotopic niches was observed between NIS and native species. The only exception was the Louisiana crayfish Procambarus clarkii, which showed a relatively high and diffuse overlap with other native invertebrates. Our findings highlighted a high niche divergence between non-indigenous and native species in Lake Trasimeno, suggesting a potentially low degree of interspecific competition that may facilitate coexistence and, in turn, limit the strength of impacts. The divergent results obtained for the Louisiana crayfish indicate that additional control measures for this invasive species are needed to mitigate its impact on the Lake Trasimeno system.},

After seven weeks, the biofilms were treated with a solution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to assess if disinfection could affect long-term biofilm development. The cyanobacterial biofilms appeared to be tolerant to H2O2 treatment, and two weeks after treatment, the biofilms that developed on glass by one of the strains presented higher biomass amounts than the untreated biofilms.

	abstract = {Freshwater bivalves are widely used as accumulation indicators and monitoring tools for assessing contaminant effects on different levels of biological integration. This pilot study aimed to explore the phylogenetic diversity of Escherichia coli isolated from freshwater mussels (Margaritifera margaritifera and Potomida littoralis) and characterize their phenotypes and antibiotic resistance profiles. Samples were collected in the Rabaçal and Tua Rivers, in the Douro basin, Portugal—two sites representing different levels of anthropogenic contamination. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed via the disk diffusion method with 21 antibiotics. Results showed that 31\% of isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR). Thus, freshwater mussels provide an effective and time-integrated approach for identifying/quantifying fecal indicators, including MDR bacteria. PCR-based assays were designed for assessing phylogenetic E. coli groups. Among the E. coli isolates, the highest prevalence (44\%) was observed in group D or E, followed by group E or Clade I (25\%), group A (19\%), and group B1 (13\%). E. coli isolated from M. margaritifera predominantly exhibited a higher prevalence of phylogroups D or E, whereas E. coli from P. littoralis showed associations with phylogroups E or clade I, B1, A, and D or E. Our results provide new insights into the phylogenetic diversity of E. coli in freshwater bivalves. Additionally, the findings highlight the possible linkage of phylogroups with the host species, the geographical location in the water stream, and human activity. Using E. coli as a bioindicator isolated from freshwater mussels helps us grasp how human activities affect the environment. This study has important implications for those interested in safeguarding water resources, especially in tackling antibiotic resistance in aquatic ecosystems.},

Proteogenomic analyses identified thousands of proteins for each species, with over 90\% of them being annotated to putative function. Functional analysis validated the relevance of the proteomic atlases by revealing similarities in functional annotation of catalogues of proteins across analogous organs in the three species, while deep contrasts between functional profiles are delimited across different organs in the same organism.

This fact increases the possibility of transport of tropical organisms by ships’ ballast water, which is the main vector for the spread of alien aquatic organisms between continents. During a study of resting stages in the bottom sediments of the island of Taiwan in 2006–2007, nine species of invertebrates were found, invasive or new to the fauna of the island, with some of them forming large banks of resting stages in sediments.},

	abstract = {Dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) have changed the fundamental community structure and biogeochemical processes of the Lake Michigan nearshore zone. There is evidence that dreissenids promote the nuisance growth of benthic algae, especially Cladophora sp. In addition, benthic macroinvertebrates have benefitted from the presence of dreissenid mussels due to the increased structural complexity along with greater nutrient availability in the benthos. These effects of the dreissenid mussel invasion are well documented; however, little is known about how these systems respond to the removal of dreissenid mussels from a once-populated area. Therefore, it is important to further our understanding of the role dreissenid mussels play in the benthic ecosystem as we contemplate future management strategies in Lake Michigan.There have been few attempts to remove large areas of dreissenid mussels in the Great Lakes: however, mussel removal attempts have been successful in both initially removing the populations from an area and preventing the re-establishment of those populations. This may be due to heavy predation of juvenile dreissenid mussels by the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) which may inhibit the repopulation of dreissenids once they are removed. In 2021, we removed a 140 m2 area of dreissenid mussels by depriving them of oxygen and nutrients using a benthic barrier membrane. This was followed by monitoring the response of the benthic community over a one-year period and comparing community composition to that on a control site where mussels were still present in large numbers (5471 ± 1709 individuals m-2). The goal of this project was to further our understanding of the relationship between dreissenids, benthic algae, and benthic macroinvertebrates in the Lake Michigan nearshore zone in Good Harbor Bay near Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore. Benthic invertebrate abundance and algae biomass were measured by gathering in situ samples. Additionally, in situ incubations and oxygen measurements along with laboratory experiments were used to determine the production of the algae. The internal phosphorus in the algal tissue was measured and compared to the algae production to determine how the concentration of internal phosphorus affects algae production. These experiments showed an increase in algae production when in the presence of mussels compared to algae grown in the absence of mussels. The results of in situ and lab experiments were comparable and revealed that Lake Michigan benthic algae has a minimum internal cell P quota (the minimum required to support net growth) that is lower than previously reported values of Cladophora and corresponds with the very low molar carbon: phosphorus ratios frequently measured in Lake Michigan Cladophora, while the measured maximum growth rate was similar to previously reported values. We used the results of in situ and laboratory experiments in a Cladophora growth model to highlight the sensitivity of benthic algal community response to small internal P changes in extremely low P environments and explore the response of the benthic algal community to light and nutrient conditions.Throughout the summer, we observed depressed non-dreissenid invertebrate abundances, lower algae productivity, and major differences in algal community composition on the mussel-free site compared to the control site. We show that this may be attributed to a lack of nutrient cycling and availability, in the absence of dreissenid mussels, accompanied by reduced habitat structural complexity. The algae on the mussel-free site had lower particulate phosphorus concentrations than that on the control site. Lower 13C-enrichment of algae in the presence of mussels is interpreted as reflecting the photosynthetic fixation of isotopically light CO2 respired by mussels, highlight the dependence of benthic algae on both carbon and nutrients released by dreissenids. These findings can be used to explore the effects of future large scale dreissenid removal efforts on nuisance benthic algae and nearshore food web structure.},

To assess the environmental contamination in the study area, seawater quality and pollutant bioaccumulation throughout the soft tissue of mussels were investigated. The samples were collected in July 2022 at four sites on the Romanian Black Sea coast considered to be differently affected by contamination. To support the suitability of LMS as a biomarker of contaminant-induced stress, the contaminant body burdens of the mussels were compared with the NRRT values. The results showed a significantly reduced NRRT in all investigated locations, particularly in port areas (mean retention time between 11 and 14 min). The elevated bioaccumulation of organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and low NRRTs were observed at the most contaminated sites (i.e., ports). The low lysosomal stability reflected stress and damage in the hemocytes of mussels and could be related to the body burdens of contaminants. LMS is an effective indicator of health status in mussels and could be considered a sensitive biomarker of cellular stress induced by contaminant exposure.},

In January and February of 2021, two dogs died and five dogs became ill after swimming in Lake Travis, central Texas, USA; one deceased dog (C1) was subjected to pathological testing. Algal materials, sediment samples, zebra mussel viscera, periphyton from shells, as well as fluids and tissues from the digestive tract of C1 were investigated for the following cyanotoxins: anatoxin-a, homoanatoxin-a, dihydroanatoxin-a (dhATX), cylindrospermopsin, saxitoxin, and microcystins. Necropsy results of C1 indicated neurotoxicosis with significant levels of dhATX in the duodenum tissues (10.51 ng/g dry weight (DW)), jejunum tissue (6.076 ng/g DW), and stomach contents (974.88 ng/g DW). Algae collected near the site of C1’s death contained levels of dhATX, ranging from 13 to 33 µg/g. By comparison, dhATX was detected at much lower concentrations in sediment samples (310.23 ng/g DW) and the periphyton on zebra mussel shells (38.45 ng/g DW). While dhATX was suspected in the deaths of canines from an event in Texas in 2019, this is the first report linking dhATX neurotoxicosis through pathological findings in Texas and potentially in the United States.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryNiche widths and individual specialization were studied based on the isotopic signals, but using the innovative and non-lethal approach. We analyzed four different body tissues with different isotopic half-lives, and revealed crucial results on trophic interactions of fish. We assume that the observed trends will occur in other food webs with similar trophic positions. For example, the apex predator status of ectotherms is linked to the individual size, not to the species. In addition, thanks to the consideration of the site trophic state (total phosphorus content), which has been little studied in relation to niche width, we observed a significant impact on the individual specialization of species in higher trophic positions. Thus, eutrophication can significantly change the foraging behavior.AbstractIntra-species variability in isotopic niches, specifically isotopic total niche width (ITNW), isotopic individual niche width (IINW), and isotopic individual specialization (IIS), was studied using an innovative approach without sacrificing the vertebrates. Stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) in four body tissues differing in isotopic half-life were analyzed from four freshwater fish species representing different trophic positions. ITNW was widest for the apex predator (European catfish) and narrowest for the obligate predator (Northern pike). IINW exhibited a polynomial trend for the European catfish, Northern pike, and Eurasian perch (mesopredator), decreasing with body mass and increasing again after exceeding a certain species-dependent body mass threshold. Thus, for ectotherms, apex predator status is linked rather to its size than to the species. In herbivores (rudd), IINW increased with body mass. The IIS of predators negatively correlated with site trophic state. Therefore, eutrophication can significantly change the foraging behavior of certain species. We assume that the observed trends will occur in other species at similar trophic positions in either aquatic or terrestrial systems. For confirmation, we recommend conducting a similar study on other species in different habitats.},

	abstract = {The three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus was introduced into Lake Constance in the 1940s and occupied a limited range until late 2012. Since then the species has expanded from a solely littoral habitat in Upper Lake Constance, but now makes seasonal migrations into the pelagic zone. This behavioral change has been accompanied by a drastic increase in stickleback abundance. In order to integrate information about feeding of sticklebacks in Upper Lake Constance over two consecutive years, stomach content analysis was combined with seasonal stable isotope analysis on two types of tissue (muscle and liver). Isotope values were also obtained for zooplankton, whitefish larvae and eggs. We calculated the contribution of potential food sources for sticklebacks’ diet using a Bayesian mixing model (SIMMR). Furthermore, we determined stickleback trophic position, and δ15N and δ13C values were compared with those of other fish species of Lake Constance. The results of the Bayesian model as well as the stomach content analysis showed clear evidence of stickleback predation on fish eggs and larvae. Stickleback δ15N values were elevated during winter and comparable to those of piscivorous pike, while δ15N values of zooplankton were reduced, and those of whitefish larvae were similar to those of sticklebacks after accounting trophic fractionation of N isotopes. Trophic position calculations further identified sticklebacks as piscivorous, while the δ13C values of the liver and stomach content analysis suggests that a benthic-pelagic species pair may exist in Lake Constance. These findings support the hypotheses that sticklebacks in Lake Constance can display piscivorous feeding behaviour on sympatric fish species, most likely whitefish larvae and eggs.},

As mussels require clean water to survive, and since conserving ecosystem services is implicit in the federal Clean Water Act, incorporating mussel conservation into state water policies could serve multiple conservation goals. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive critical review of three topics related to freshwater mussels: their contribution to ecosystem services, their links with water quality, and threats to their survival from water pollutants and extent of protection available from regulation. In so doing, we identify gaps between the water quality requirements of mussels and the protection provided by current water regulation to help inform clean water and conservation goals in Minnesota. We find freshwater mussels to be generally sensitive to a wide variety of pollutants, and particularly to nutrients such as total nitrogen and total phosphorus and to major ions such as chloride. In addition, we find that current state water quality standards may not be sufficiently protective of mussels. We formulate a framework for determining an effective conservation strategy for mussels in Minnesota based on ecological and economic criteria to ensure adequate conservation at a reasonable cost.},

The determination of trends in the movement of aquatic species in their geographical distribution over time is important because it may help in the management of a species in aquatic ecosystems. There are also knowledge gaps on the long-term trends in the movements of Southern European aquatic alien invertebrates. The study provides the first evidence of both northward and southward movements of these species based on available observations from 1940 to 2021, using meta-analyses and GAM modelling. To date, the majority (98\%) of analysed Southern European aquatic alien invertebrates of Mediterranean and Ponto-Caspian origin have moved to the north. Among them, 61\% are Ponto-Caspian aquatic alien invertebrates that moved only to the north, and 4\% are Mediterranean aquatic alien invertebrates that moved only to the north; the rest include species that moved to the north and south: 27\% are Ponto-Caspian aquatic alien invertebrates, and 6\% are Mediterranean aquatic alien invertebrates. The one-way movement to the south was observed only in 2\% of Mediterranean aquatic alien species. The study will help in understanding the movement patterns of Southern European aquatic alien invertebrates and in the effective management of aquatic ecosystems that allow for the co-existence of people and the rest of biodiversity.},

In this paper, we studied the genetic diversity and differentiation of P. complanata based on newly sequenced COI and ND1 gene fragments, and on available sequences from the NCBI GenBank. We discovered a localized and highly divergent lineage in the Don River basin and a widespread but low diversified lineage distributed from the Volga River basin to the Oise River in France. A star-like haplotype network, results of mismatch analysis, and significant negative values of neutrality tests reveal that the pan-European lineage went through a bottleneck event. The discovery of the separate lineage in the Don River basin is and additional evidence of the existence of Pleistocene glacial refugia in the south of the Russian Plain. Moreover, this finding confirms the significance of the Azov Sea drainage as a freshwater biodiversity hotspot of great conservation importance.},

It is a main driver of the significant environmental changes in an all-arid part of Crimea. No zooplankton studies in the canal have been carried out up to this time at all. In 2022, zooplankton was studied in different sites from May to October. Total zooplankton abundance fluctuated between 170 and 19,560 ind. m−3, and wet biomass between 0.75 and 1057 mg m−3. In total, 11 Rotifera species, 11 Cladocera species, and 15 Copepoda species, including 2 Harpacticoida, 5 Calanoida, and 8 Cyclopoida, were found in plankton. The most common Rotifera species were Brachionus calyciflorus, Euchlanis dilatate, and Keratella cochlearis. Among Cladocera, Chydorus sphaericus, Bosmina longirostris, and Coronatella rectangular have the highest frequency of occurrence. In Copepoda, these were Acanthocyclops vernalis, Eurytemora affinis, and Nitocra typica. Among the 37 species found in NCC, 10 were not previously noted in the water bodies of Crimea. Among rotifers, they were Ploesoma hudsoni, Polyarthra dolichoptera, Pompholyx complanata, Synchaeta grandis, and Synchaeta stylata. Bosminopsis zernowi, Rhynchotalona rostrata, and Scapholeberis mucronata were not noted before among Cladocera. Eurytemora lacustris and Cyclops smirnovi were first found in Crimea among Copepoda. New technogenic aquatic ecosystems such as NCC are the “gateway” for the invasion of alien species into the new regions.},

	abstract = {The current paper presents the first effort to organize a comprehensive review of the Invasive Alien Species (IAS) of Greece. For this purpose, a database was developed with fields of information on the taxonomy, origin, ecology and pathways of introduction of terrestrial, freshwater and marine species. Our database includes a) taxa in the Union’s list that are present in Greece, b) taxa already present in Greece and considered to be invasive, and c) taxa highly likely to enter Greece in the next 10 years and become invasive. The Database served as the starting point for the compilation of the National List of Alien Invasive Species (HELLAS-ALIENS) in compliance with the EU Regulation 1143/2014. Overall, the HELLAS-ALIENS comprises 126 species, i.e. 32 terrestrial and freshwater plant species, 14 terrestrial invertebrates, 28 terrestrial vertebrates, 30 freshwater fishes and invertebrates and 22 marine species. Terrestrial invertebrates, birds and mammals are mainly of Asiatic origin. Most of the terrestrial plants have their native geographical distribution in the Americas (North and South). Most of the freshwater invertebrates and fishes are of North American origin, while the majority of the marine species are of Indo-Pacific origin. The first records of IAS concern terrestrial plant species, and date back to the 19th century, while those in freshwater and marine ecosystems seem to have been systematically recorded some decades later. Regarding the pathways of introduction, most of the taxa arrived in Greece or are expected to arrive through escape from confinement and unaided. The majority of the terrestrial, freshwater and marine species have been evaluated as of High-risk for the indigenous biodiversity and only 3\% of the species listed have been evaluated of Low-risk. Our results provide an important baseline for management and action plans, as required by the priorities set by the European Union through the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030.},

This yearlong, mixed-methods study centers on a grant-funded program aimed at supporting secondary teachers’ implementation of environmental place-based education (PBE), specifically meaningful watershed education experiences (MWEEs). Intended outcomes of this grant-based program included increasing middle school students’ environmental stewardship capacity; expanding their Great Lakes literacy; building teachers’ capacity for implementing robust environmental PBE; and increasing teachers’ capacity for teaching Great Lakes content. Situated in the Midwestern United States, two experienced PBE teachers and their middle school students (N = 226) from two separate schools participated in this study. Findings indicate that PBE teaching and learning experiences are impacted by multiple factors, including those that are program- and school-based as well as external factors such as weather and community partnerships. Moreover, when students perceive that they have opportunities to make choices and share ideas when engaged in PBE, they are more likely to see direct connections between PBE-based learning and the ways their stewardship endeavors can and do positively impact their local community and environment.},

To date, dreissenid mussel control efforts in open water have included physical, biological, and chemical methods. The feasibility of successful dreissenid mussel management or eradication in lakes is relatively undocumented in the freshwater management literature. This review presents information on 33 open water dreissenid mussel control projects in 23 North America lakes. We reviewed data from past dreissenid mussel control projects and identified patterns and knowledge gaps to help inform adaptive management strategies. The three key lessons learned include (1) pre- and post-treatment survey methods that are designed to meet management objectives are beneficial, e.g., by sampling for all life stages and taking into account that no survey method is completely comprehensive; (2) defining the treatment area—particularly ensuring it is sufficiently large to capture all life stages present—is critical to meeting management objectives; and (3) control projects provide an opportunity to collect water chemistry, effects on non-target organisms, and other efficacy-related data that can inform safe and effective adaptive management.},

	abstract = {Pb is one of the most extensively used harmful heavy metals in Bangladesh, and its occurrence in waters affects aquatic organisms significantly. The tropical pearl mussel, Lamellidens marginalis, was exposed to different concentrations (T1 21.93 mgL−1, T2 43.86 mgL−1, and T3 87.72 mgL−1) of Pb(NO3)2 and was evaluated against a control C 0 mgL−1 of Pb(NO3)2, followed by a 96 h acute toxicity test. The LC50 value was recorded as 219.32 mgL−1. The physicochemical parameters were documented regularly for each treatment unit. The values of \% SGR, shell weight, soft tissue wet weight, and weight gain remained statistically higher for the control group in comparison with the treatment. No mortality was noted for control units, while a gradually decreased survival rate was recorded for the different treatment groups. Fulton’s condition factor was recorded as highest in the control and lowest in the T3 unit, while the condition indices did not vary between the control and treatment groups. The hemocyte was accounted as maximum in the control and T1, while minimum in T2 and T3. The serum lysosomal parameters also followed a similar pattern, and a significantly low level of lysosomal membrane stability, and serum lysosome activity was noted for T3 and T2 units in comparison to the control group. The histology of the gill, kidney, and muscle was well structured in the control group, while distinct pathologies were observed in the gill, kidney, and muscle tissue of different treatment groups. The quantitative comparison revealed that the intensity of pathological alteration increased as the dosage of Pb increased. The current study, therefore, indicated that intrusion of Pb(NO3)2 in the living medium significantly alters growth performance and hemocyte counts, and chronic toxicity induces histomorphological abnormalities in vital organs.},

Several strategies have been developed to mitigate fouling-related issues in marine environments, including developing marine coatings using nanotechnology and biomimetic models, and incorporating natural compounds, peptides, bacteriophages, or specific enzymes on surfaces. The advantages and limitations of these strategies are discussed in this review, and the development of novel surfaces and coatings is highlighted. The performance of these novel antibiofilm coatings is currently tested by in vitro experiments, which should try to mimic real conditions in the best way, and/or by in situ tests through the immersion of surfaces in marine environments. Both forms present their advantages and limitations, and these factors should be considered when the performance of a novel marine coating requires evaluation and validation. Despite all the advances and improvements against marine biofouling, progress toward an ideal operational strategy has been slow given the increasingly demanding regulatory requirements. Recent developments in self-polishing copolymers and fouling-release coatings have yielded promising results which set the basis for the development of more efficient and eco-friendly antifouling strategies.},

	abstract = {The field of wildlife conservation is comprised of a variety of players with different contexts and approaches. Zoos and aquariums, historically largely focused on public entertainment, are shifting more towards conservation-minded missions and can play a unique role in wildlife conservation by leveraging their distinct assets. The Minnesota Zoo is an AZA-accredited institution and an agency of the State of Minnesota that has been conducting wildlife conservation for over 40 years. Here, we review our current portfolio of local field projects, including initiatives targeting pollinators, native mussels, turtles, and bison, using several considerations to structure and better understand how our unique context has shaped our work. Our designation as a state agency has impacted our initiatives by necessitating a focus on local efforts and has facilitated many partnerships with other government agencies. Indeed, partnerships have been vital to our success and have shaped our programs significantly since their inception. All of the Zoo’s conservation initiatives are built on a bedrock of sound science, and we continue to contribute to the field through research, utilizing the expertise of department staff. In addition, the various funding streams that support our programs have dramatically shaped our work and have created some siloing of staff within the department. However, grant funding can serve as a buffer against the impacts of economic uncertainty, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, our programs have expanded and our objectives have pivoted over the years in response to changing needs and opportunities; such flexibility—and increased flexibility for our staff—is imperative to the future success of these efforts. The Minnesota Zoo’s narrative is unique and helps us understand how we can continue to most effectively carry out local conservation efforts. As we work to protect habitats and save species from extinction, it is important to utilize the distinct assets that each organization can contribute in order to have the greatest collective impact.},

	abstract = {The cave systems of the Neretva River basin in the Dinaric Karst are home to Congeria kusceri, one of the very few known examples of stygobiotic bivalve mollusks, which displays several unique life history traits and adaptations that allowed its adaptation to the subterranean environment. This endemic species is undergoing rapid decline, most likely linked with habitat degradation, which might seriously threaten its survival in the next few decades. Unfortunately, the urgent need for effective conservation efforts is hampered by the lack of effective regulations aimed at preserving remnant populations as well as by our limited knowledge of the biology of this species. Although the precise factors underlying the disappearance of C. kusceri from its type locations are not entirely clear, the alteration of seasonal changes in water temperatures and alkalinity is most likely involved, as these are the main drivers of shell growth, spawning, and the onset and progression of the new gametogenic cycle. While these aspects have so far only been studied using morphological and physiological observations, future conservation efforts would certainly benefit from an integrated multidisciplinary approach. Here, using RNA-sequencing, we provide an overview of the modulation of gene expression recorded in five key tissues (the mantle, gonads, gills, adductor muscle, and digestive gland) between early June and late September. We highlight the presence of markedly tissue-specific responses, with the most dramatic changes affecting the gonads, mantle, and gills. We further identified a drastic switch in the use of energy budgets between the two periods, with evidence of ongoing shell growth and high metabolic activity in the mantle and gills at the early time point, followed by a massive redirection of all available energy to the gonads for the generation of new gamete primordia in early autumn.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryReports of invasive species have increased dramatically in recent decades, raising public awareness. While human activities favor their spread, global warming is believed to promote the establishment of alien species and pose a major threat to native ecosystems. The freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta is an example of a globally successful spread, attracting public attention with its short-lived, eye-catching medusa blooms. Two life stages of this jellyfish are predators: the benthic polyps and the planktonic medusae. Both must meet the requirements in their new food webs to become established. We compared their niches with those of presumed native competitors and found a strong overlap for the medusa stage, suggesting high competition with native zooplanktonic predators and young fish. In contrast, the polyps of invasive Craspedacusta and native Hydra differed in their niches, possibly favoring a long-term invasion success of Craspedacusta.AbstractWhen species spread into new regions, competition with native species and predatory–prey relationships play a major role in whether the new species can successfully establish itself in the recipient food web and become invasive. In aquatic habitats, species with a metagenetic life cycle, such as the freshwater jellyfish Craspedacusta with benthic polyps and planktonic medusae, have to meet the requirements of two distinct life stages occurring in two habitats with different food webs. Here, we examined the trophic position of both life stages, known to be predatory, and compared their niches with those of putative native competitors using stable isotope analysis. We found that δ13C and δ15N signatures of medusae overlapped with those of co-occurring Chaoborus larvae and juvenile fish (Rutilus rutilus) in a well-studied lake, implying high competition with these native predators. The comparison of δ15N signatures of Hydra and Craspedacusta polyps in four additional lakes revealed their similar trophic position, matching their predatory lifestyle. However, their δ13C signatures differed not only across all four of the lakes studied but also within one lake over time, suggesting a preference for pelagic or benthic food sources. We conclude that invasive and native polyps differ in their niches due to different food spectra, which favors the invasion success of Craspedacusta.},

	abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are volatile and short-lived molecules playing important roles in several physiological functions, including immunity and physiological adaptation to unsuitable environmental conditions. In an eco-immunological view, the energetic costs associated with an advantageous metabolic apparatus able to cope with wide changes in environmental parameters, e.g., temperature range, water salinity or drought, could be further balanced by the advantages that this apparatus may also represent in other situations, e.g., during the immune response. This review provides an overview of molluscs included in the IUCN list of the worst invasive species, highlighting how their relevant capacity to manage ROS production during physiologically challenging situations can also be advantageously employed during the immune response. Current evidence suggests that a relevant capacity to buffer ROS action and their damaging consequences is advantageous in the face of both environmental and immunological challenges, and this may represent a trait for potential invasiveness. This should be considered in order to obtain or update information when investigating the potential of the invasiveness of emerging alien species, and also in view of ongoing climate changes.},

	abstract = {The box tropical mussel Septifer bilocularis lives attached to a hard substratum, forming a dense aggregation or patch. The aggregation occurs at the time of larvae settlement in response to different cues. Larvae may have a positive response whereas larvae may settle and attach to the substratum, while in a negative response, postpone settling occurs. Byssus threads are produced and attached to the substratum, and for some reason, they are affected by many variables. We studied whether the attachment was affected by sites, position in the patch, and substratum. Large and small patches of mussel beds were selected arbitrarily, each in 3 replicates. Substrata of palm, coconut, polypropylene fibres, and mussel shells with byssus threads, each in 4 replicates, were distributed randomly into a PVC plate with 16 holes. The PVC plates with experimental substrata were placed along the edge and in the middle of large and small patches. A three-factorial ANOVA was then performed on samples of sites, position in patches, and substratum as main effects. A significant effect of sites, position within patches, and substratum as well were found. A significantly high number of new settlers in small patches than in other positions within patches occurred. The larger number of new settlers was found on coconut, palm, and polypropylene fibres, while low numbers on the mussel shells with byssus threads were found. The new settlers of S. bilocularis ({\textless}1 mm) with transparent shells were observed attached to coconut, palm, and polypropylene fibres. In contrast, the new settlers ranged from {\textgreater}1 mm to 3 mm with dark green shells attached to mussel shells with byssus threads. This study suggests that early settlement occurs when mussels’ larvae first settle and attach to coconut, palm, and polypropylene fibres before reattaching to adult shells with byssus threads.},

	abstract = {Predicting which non-native species will negatively impact biodiversity is a longstanding research priority. The Functional Response (FR ; resource use in relation to availability) is a classical ecological concept that has been increasingly applied to quantify, assess and compare ecological impacts of non-native species. Despite this recent growth, an overview of applications and knowledge gaps across relevant contexts is currently lacking. We conducted a systematic review using a combination of terms regarding FR and invasion science to synthesise scientific studies that apply the FR approach in the field and to suggest new areas where it could have valuable applications. Trends of publications using FR in invasion science and publications about FR in general were compared through the Activity Index. Data were extracted from papers to reveal temporal, bibliographic, and geographic trends, patterns in study attributes such as type of interaction and habitat investigated, taxonomic groups used, and context-dependencies assessed. In total, 120 papers were included in the review. We identified substantial unevenness in the reporting of FRs in invasion science, despite a rapidly growing number of studies. To date, research has been geographically skewed towards North America and Europe, as well as towards predator-prey interactions in freshwater habitats. Most studies have focused on a few species of invertebrates and fishes. Species origin, life stage, environmental temperature and habitat complexity were the most frequently considered context-dependencies. We conclude that while the FR approach has thus far been narrowly applied, it has broad potential application in invasion science and can be used to test major hypotheses in this research field.},

In addition to this, the study also intends to review their ecological requirements to gain a better understanding of their invasive potential and distribution dynamics. Specifically, the study focuses on updating the distribution and ecological characteristics of these freshwater bivalves in the lower sector of the Danube River and the lakes of the Danube Delta. The purpose is to better understand their invasive and distribution dynamics and to develop effective measures to limit their spread in the future. To achieve this, environmental proxies such as sediment particle size and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) concentrations were used to assess their tolerances. However, the results did not show a significant correlation between the densities of these bivalves and the analyzed environmental parameters. Despite this, the species were found in high densities and formed well-developed benthic communities in some stations. The study contributes to the understanding of the invasiveness of these bivalve species and their distribution range dynamics. Nonetheless, further investigation is required to fully comprehend the role of environmental parameters in their distribution. The study covers the period between 2010 and 2020 and focuses on the lower Danube River sector and Danube Delta.},

	abstract = {The objectives of our survey were to determine the most important environmental factors within buffer zones that influenced mollusc communities and to evaluate the ecological conservation value of natural aquatic habitats (NAHs) that support mollusc species. Analysis of the spatial structure of buffer zones and catchments was based on a set of landscape metrics. Land cover classes were determined, and buffer zones within a radius of 500 m from a sampling point were marked out. Mollusc samples were collected from each NAHs. Our results showed that the number of patches and mean patch size were most associated with the distribution of mollusc species. Within patches of buffer zones, the length of the catchment boundaries with low-density housing, an increasing area of forest and pH of the water were also significant. Our results proved that landscape metrics provide essential information about catchment anthropogenic transformation. Therefore, landscape metrics and the designated buffer zones should be included in restoration plans for the river, water bodies and adjacent habitats as elements of modern, sustainable water management. NAHs located along a valley of a lowland river provide refuges for molluscs, play an essential role in the dispersal of IAS, create important protective biogeochemical barriers for rivers, constitute necessary sources of moisture and water and support microhabitats for distinct mollusc communities, especially in the context of global warming.},

The goal of this study is to provide, for the first time in the Eastern Mediterranean, information on biofoulant species in Greek mussel farms over a long time scale and to describe the best management strategies that will reduce costs while preventing and controlling these biofoulants. An interview survey was conducted to assess mussel farmers’ expert judgment on non-endemic ascidians as well as their opinions on the magnitude of the invasion’s impacts. The results show that ascidians and, to a lesser extent, sponges exhibited the highest intensities in mussel farm units during the last 20 years, whereas gastropod invasion was limited and observed after 2015. Ascidians exhibited the most significant impact on the final product, whereas sponges showed a moderately negative impact, with reduced amounts of flesh being the most important effect. The cost of farming management only rose with ascidians and sponges and was mostly impacted by damages to maintenance and labor and, to a lesser extent, fuel. All invasive species affected the operational cost of production at a rate of 21–50\%, which peaked from July to September. The above problems are increasingly aggravating in cases where farm units undergo production shutdown due to plankton bloom. Preventive management action against the establishment of biofoulants in Greek mussel aquaculture is of paramount importance.},

	abstract = {Aquatic non-indigenous species (NIS) threaten biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and the economy worldwide. Monitoring NIS is of immediate concern to identify newly arriving species, assess the efficacy of mitigation measures, and report long-term indicators of introduction, spread, and impacts. The challenges associated with conventional methods of specimen collection and morphological identification have led to the development of alternative methods, such as DNA-based methods, which could offer rapid and cost-effective detection of NIS. Depending on whether a few (targeted monitoring) or many species (passive monitoring) are being monitored, environmental DNA (eDNA) can infer presence-absence and relative abundances, enabling informed decisions and actions to be made based on patterns of detection. Compared to more conventional methods, eDNA tools can increase the levels of detection and sensitivity for rare and elusive species, which is even more noticeable for some taxa when using targeted monitoring. The use of DNA-based tools not only minimizes the onus on taxonomic expertise and reduces resource demands but can also be more sensitive and cost-efficient in detecting NIS, thus proving its value as an early warning tool. As nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) methods advance rapidly for NIS detection, there must be a balance between method sensitivity, logistical requirements, and associated costs, which must be factored into future management decisions. While there are many complementary reviews available, our aim is to emphasize the importance of incorporating eDNA tools into NIS surveys and to highlight the available opportunities in this field.},

We assessed the presence and potential pressure by IAS on terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems across 27 European countries, for 66 IAS of policy concern. We computed a spatial indicator that accounts for the number of IAS present in an area and the extent of the ecosystems affected; for each ecosystem, we also looked at the pattern of invasions in the different biogeographical regions. We found disproportionally greater invasion in the Atlantic region, followed by Continental and Mediterranean regions, possibly related to historical patterns of first introductions. Urban and freshwater ecosystems were the most invaded (nearly 68\% and ca. 52\% of their extent respectively), followed by forest and woodland (nearly 44\%). The average potential pressure of IAS was greater across cropland and forests, where we also found the lowest coefficient of variation.

To this end, we used a half-century (1969–2018) of abundance and size-at-age data from Lake Erie’s walleye (Sander vitreus) population to determine how anthropogenic alterations have influenced intraspecific interactions. Before the 1980s, the length-at-age of younger walleye (ages 1 and 2) negatively correlated with older (age 3 +) walleye abundance, signaling a ‘density feedback’ in which intraspecific competition limited growth. However, after the early 1980s this signal of intraspecific competition disappeared. This decoupling of the density feedback was related to multiple anthropogenic changes, including a larger walleye population resulting from better fisheries management, planned nutrient reductions to improve water quality and transparency, warmer water temperatures, and the proliferation of a non-native fish with novel traits (white perch, Morone americana). We argue that these changes may have reduced competitive interactions by reducing the spatial overlap between older and younger walleye and by introducing novel prey. Our findings illustrate the potential for anthropogenic change to diminish density dependent intraspecific interactions within top predator populations, which has important ramifications for predicting predator dynamics and managing natural resources.},

Besides simple preventive measures such as "clean, drain, dry", resource management agencies recommend decontaminating watercraft and equipment using high water pressure, rinsing with hot water, or air-drying to inhibit this mode of secondary spread. There is a lack of studies assessing the efficacy of these methods under realistic conditions and their feasibility for recreational boaters. Hence, we addressed this knowledge gap via experiments on six invertebrate and plant AIS present in Ontario. Washing at high pressures of 900–1200 psi removed the most biological material (90\%) from surfaces. Brief ({\textless} 10 s) exposure to water at ≥ 60 °C caused nearly 100\% mortality among all species tested, except banded mystery snails. Acclimation to temperatures from 15 to 30 °C before hot water exposure had little effect on the minimum temperature required for no survival. Air-drying durations producing complete mortality were ≥ 60 h for zebra mussels and spiny waterfleas, and ≥ 6 days among plants, whereas survival remained high among snails after a week of air-drying. Hot water exposure followed by air-drying was more effective than either method separately against all species tested.},

	abstract = {Aquatic invasive species (AIS) are an expensive problem and the best thing we can do to manage AIS is to prevent their spread. Preventing the spread of AIS requires an interjurisdictional and big data approach to find pathways, locations, and people to prioritize for early interventions. In this dissertation, I use innovative methods and sources of data to guide decision making in AIS prevention efforts. First, anglers are major vectors of AIS and identifying pathways of angler movement provide an opportunity to intervene and stop the spread. Angler movement data has previously been restricted by costly angler surveys with low participation rates. Using catch logs from a widely popular angler app, I built an angler network that revealed an invasion superhighway that spanned the United States and likely contributed to the spread of two prolific invaders (e.g., Dreissena and Myriophyllum species). Next, identifying lakes that are vulnerable to invasion provide an opportunity for early detection and intervention. I used machine learning models to predict the presence of five aquatic invaders that have spread across the Upper Mississippi River basin. The models identified important features that make a lake vulnerable to invasion and identified high-risk sites for prioritizing AIS management. Then I discussed methods of dealing with poor data quality in big data used for invasive species management and proposed methods of data gathering to improve future studies. Lastly, targeted education and inspection of the most transient anglers would be valuable in slowing the spread of AIS. The variability in angler experience, skill, and motivation, means that anglers pose a heterogeneous risk to spreading AIS. In the last study, I used the angler app data to infer several characteristics of angler behavior and tendencies to predict transience. The results provided information to better inform AIS public outreach and enforcement campaigns. By identifying the pathways, locations, and people for targeted AIS management, this dissertation provides tangible results and scalable methods for preventative efforts. This work highlights the important role anglers can play in the prevention of AIS spread. However, it also demonstrates a need for better largescale data management and quality improvements that are necessary for studying AIS at an appropriately large-scale.},

	abstract = {Invasive “game-changer” species cause severe ecological impacts such as “phase shifts” in recipient ecosystems all over the world. Since the early 1990s, the ongoing global spread of the small but highly invasive Ponto-Caspian round goby Neogobius melanostomus into diverse freshwater and marine ecosystems has been observed. We postulate that this species is an ideal model to better understand and mitigate aquatic invasions. Its wide invaded range, as well as its diverse impacts on native species, have triggered a large body of research worldwide concerning its spread, ecology, and traits facilitating invasion. Several hypotheses related to invasiveness have been tested for the round goby, which are also applicable to other invasive species and for understanding general principles in invasion biology. However, a common theory explaining invasion success, especially in round goby, is still lacking. Many case studies do not consider time since invasion and use different sampling protocols and methodologies, hampering the comparability of results and conclusions. We thus propose strengthening the network of goby researchers and establishing long-term databases based on continuous and harmonized monitoring covering all stages of the invasion process as crucial requirements to better understand and manage aquatic invasions. In many cases, such monitoring can easily be integrated into existing survey schemes.},

An extensive literary search has been carried out, and virtually all existing publications of recent decades on the findings of freshwater mollusk species new to Siberia were taken into account. We examined extensive malacological collections of some of Russia’s and Kazakhstan’s scientific organizations. The core of the examined material is our own observations and collections made in various parts of Siberia and adjacent areas. An annotated checklist of neobiotic species of mollusks reliably recorded in Siberia is presented, and probable mechanisms and “corridors” of infiltration of these species into the region are discussed. Most of the discovered snail species belong to a group popular among aquarists, and their source of introduction is obvious. Another large portion of species infiltrate into the region with the development of fish farming. A classification of species of neobiotic freshwater mollusks of Siberia was proposed and a forecast was made for changes in the Siberian freshwater malacofauna for the coming decades. In our opinion, at present it is possible to accept the newest stage in the genesis of the freshwater malacofauna of Siberia, occurring in conditions specific to the Anthropocene.},

	abstract = {To better understand the phenotypic plasticity of the highly invasive native weed, Pedicularis kansuensis, we investigated and compared phenotypes (morphology, biomass, and nutrient composition) at different levels of invasion (low: 0 {\textless} cover ≤ 30\%; medium: 30\% {\textless} cover ≤ 70\%; and high: cover {\textgreater} 70\%). With the increase in invasion level, the plasticity of inflorescence length, single-leaf thickness, and specific leaf area increased, while the plasticity of single-leaf area and crown width decreased. During the invasion process, we observed significant density-dependent effects, including changed morphological characteristics, increased total aboveground biomass, and decreased plant height, inflorescence length, root length, crown width, single-leaf area, structure biomass of structures (root, stem, inflorescence), and individual biomass (p {\textless} 0.05). During the reproductive period of P. kansuensis, the resource allocation (C, N, and P content, total biomass, biomass allocation) to inflorescence was significantly higher than to root and stem, while the elemental ratios (C:N, C:P, N:P) of inflorescences were significantly lower than those of roots and stems (p {\textless} 0.05). When the invasion level increased, the ratio of inflorescence C:N and biomass allocation to roots increased significantly; conversely, inflorescence N and biomass allocation to inflorescences and stems decreased significantly (p {\textless} 0.05). This led to a decrease in resource allocation to aboveground parts and more resources allocated to the roots, significantly increasing the root-to-shoot ratio (p {\textless} 0.05). Based on the phenotypic differences among different invasion levels, we suggest that P. kansuensis adapted to a competitive environment by regulating morphology, biomass, and nutrient allocation, thereby enhancing the potential of invasion and spread.},

	abstract = {This review discusses several research studies that employed comet assay to evaluate the environmental impact of genotoxins in aquatic environments. It focuses on in vivo and in situ studies of aquatic animals. New chemicals are being added each year to the existing burden of toxic substances in the environment. Excessive agricultural and industrial activities adversely affect biodiversity, threatening the survival of species in a particular habitat, as well as posing disease risks to humans. Some of the chemicals, e.g., pesticides and heavy metals, may be genotoxic to the sentinel species and/or to non-target species, causing deleterious effects in somatic or germ cells. Comet assay is a quick, sensitive, and low-cost technique for detecting DNA strand breakage. However, the comet assay has much more to offer than being an assay for testing DNA strand breaks in animal organs. The use of repair enzymes increases the range of DNA lesions that can be detected with the assay. Comparing data from studies that employed different approaches, such as empirical scoring or comet tail lengths, comet assay is one of the challenging techniques to be utilized in environmental studies. The relative amount of DNA in the comet tail indicates DNA break intensity. The assay has been modified to detect various base alterations by including the digestion of nucleoids with a lesion-specific endonuclease. The determination of DNA damage in these indicator species using the comet test would thus offer information on the genotoxic potential of their habitat at an early stage. This would enable intervention techniques to prevent or mitigate adverse health impacts in sentinel animals and humans.},

	abstract = {Given the omnipresence and potential of entering the food web, the recently emerged pollutant microplastics (MPs) has become a global threat. The impacts of MPs in marine ecosystems are well documented, but the freshwater environment is relatively understudied. Improper disposal of industrial and commercial waste introduces MPs in the freshwater environment where it is either transported to the ocean or eventually settles down to the bottom. To elicit the impacts on components of fitness, the effect of inert particles on the reproductive and behavioral performance on organisms can only be translated after long-term experiments, but most of the available information on freshwater benthos relies only on short-term experiments. This study investigated the rates of microplastic ingestion, locomotion and reproduction in the globally invasive snail Physa acuta (Gastropoda, Pulmonata) at six environmental concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/200 mL) of polystyrene (PS) MPs particle (size = 32–63µm) for 93 days after maturity. The PS particle ingestion was confirmed by analysis of P. acuta excreta and tissue digestion. P. acuta displayed Type II functional response to MPs. We measured locomotion speed and reproductive rate for 93 days after maturation at 20, 30 and 40 mg/200 mL concentrations of PS MPs equivalent to 500 × 104, 750 × 104 and 1000 × 104 particles/200 mL, respectively. Average locomotion speed and egg capsule production were significantly lower in the MP applied environment than in the control. The percent reduction in ovisac production and egg hatching success were a direct function of MP concentrations in the medium., although, in a natural setup, plastic debris was observed as a frequent oviposition substrate for P. acuta favoring the species in dispersal. The present results point to a higher tolerance of P. acuta to MPs and their role as a vehicle of MP transfer from sediment to fish.},

The coast of Alexandria, Egypt, experiences multiple human pressure, including sewage discharge, engineering activities (urbanization) for armoring purposes, and beach nourishment. Hard-bottom polychaete assemblages are demonstrated to reflect coastal areas’ environmental status, though their use in monitoring programs is uncommon. The sensitivity of hard-bottom polychaete assemblages in depicting variations in environmental conditions of two sites exposed to the discharge of polluted water and three sites exposed to urbanization was analyzed. The high spatial and temporal variation in species abundance and diversity probably hid differences among the assemblages exposed to the two forms of pressure while highlighting differences among sites exposed to the same impact form. In addition, changes in the algal substrate probably influenced the observed pattern. Temporal variation of salinity and differences in biological oxygen demand (BOD) and the organic matter appeared to indirectly affect polychaete abundance and diversity by favoring tolerant algal taxa such as Ulva sp. Contrary to what was expected, assemblage variation due to site-specific environmental features accounted for more than the variations due to the two forms of human pressure in shaping differences among polychaete assemblages.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryIn this study, we simulated the distribution range and its shift of Pantala flavescens in past, present, and future scenarios, and revealed its habitat properties. Except at high latitudes near the poles (e.g., Antarctica and near the Arctic Circle), it is found almost everywhere in the world, with the most suitable habitat mainly in East Asia and the United States. The max temperature of the warmest month and the precipitation of the wettest month are important factors affecting its distribution, and its suitability decreases with the increase of altitude. Climate warming promoted the shift of lowly and moderately suitable habitats into moderately and highly suitable habitats, especially in equatorial regions, which increased the total habitat area. This study provides a global dynamic distribution pattern of P. flavescens across large temporal and spatial scales, and provides a reference for further understanding of its biodiversity and conservation.AbstractDragonflies are sensitive to climate change due to their special habitat in aquatic and terrestrial environments, especially Pantala flavescens, which have extraordinary migratory abilities in response to climate change on spatio-temporal scales. At present, there are major gaps in the documentation of insects and the effects of climatic changes on the habitat and species it supports. In this study, we model the global distribution of a wandering glider dragonfly, P. flavescens, and detected the important environmental factors shaping its range, as well as habitat shifts under historical and future warming scenarios. The results showed a global map of species ranges of P. flavescens currently, including southern North America, most of South America, south-central Africa, most of Europe, South, East and Southeast Asia, and northern Oceania, in total, ca. 6581.667 × 104 km2. BIO5 (the max temperature of warmest month) and BIO13 (the precipitation of wettest month) greatly explained its species ranges. The historic refugia were identified around the Great Lakes in the north-central United States. Future warming will increase the total area of suitable habitat and shift the type of suitable habitat compared to the current distribution. The habitat suitability of P. flavescens decreased with elevation, global warming forced it to expand to higher elevations, and the habitat suitability of P. flavescens around the equator increased with global warming. Overall, our study provides a global dynamic pattern of suitable habitats for P. flavescens from the perspective of climate change, and provides a useful reference for biodiversity research and biological conservation.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryThe introduction of alien species is one of the major causes of biodiversity loss. The American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is considered to be one of the most harmful invasive species which overall threatens native amphibians. The detection of an invasive species in the first stage of its arrival is critical to control its colonization and to avoid its establishment. This early detection requires tools with high sensitivity. Methods based on the analysis of free environmental DNA (eDNA) are promising. The present article develops an eDNA assay to monitor the early process of invasion of the American bullfrog in the Ebre Delta (Spain), in a scenario where the presence of bullfrog specimens is really low and scarcely detected by traditional methods. In 2018, the first bullfrog tadpoles were found for the first time in the Ebre Delta. Two years after, despite the species not being well established, our eDNA assay detected the presence of bullfrogs in several locations. This methodology proved to yield a higher sensitivity with a lower sampling effort than traditional methods. Based on our experience, we also provided solutions to face challenges associated with the use of eDNA. Developing a rapid and low-cost-effective protocol to use in the early stages of an invasion (as occurred with the American bullfrog in the Iberian Peninsula) is essential to facilitate the detection, control, and eradication of an invasive species in the early stages of the invasion process.AbstractThe American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus) is considered to be one of the most harmful invasive species. In the Iberian Peninsula, this species had been cited occasionally until the year 2018, when L. catesbeianus appeared in the Ebre Delta, and, for the first time, it started breeding in a territory of the Peninsula. Using environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis and visual surveys, the American bullfrog invasion in the Ebre Delta was monitored across two consecutive years (2019–2020). No specimens were observed in 2019, and results for the eDNA survey also failed to detect this species in the Delta. In 2020, two individuals were captured and, under the most conservative criteria to constrain the number of positive detections, eDNA analyses detected the presence of the American bullfrog in at least five locations. Performing an eDNA assay yielded a higher sensitivity with a lower sampling effort than traditional methods. Although the American bullfrog does not appear to still be well-established in the Ebre Delta, only a few bullfrog individuals could be enough for their establishment in suitable habitats. In this context, eDNA assays are essential tools to facilitate the detection, control, and eradication of this species in the first stage of the invasion process.},

In this review, we summarize the biological information about shellfish biomonitors and the results of studies focused on the development and use of the bioindicator species in early warning systems in Russia. Since the mid-1980s, Russian specialists have developed online biomonitoring systems; as in the rest of world, there are two main approaches that are currently applied to study the physiological status of potential biosensor shellfish species and to monitor freshwater and marine systems: valvometry (registration of gaping activity in bivalve mollusks) and photoplethysmography (registration of cardiac activity in mollusks and crustaceans). Valve movement responses to stressors such as abnormal conditions and pollutants include the closure of shell valves for a long period, decrease in the average distance between valves, rapid shell opening, and higher closing frequency. Cardiac activity reactions of shellfish to stress factors include rapid increases in heart rate and stress index, higher variability in heart rate than under normal conditions, and longer periods required for heart rate recovery after stress. The most common bioindicators used to monitor environmental disturbances in marine ecosystems are blue mussels, Iceland scallops, and red king crabs in cold-water habitats and Black Sea mussels in warmer waters as well as freshwater mussels and crayfish in fresh waters.},

In this study, an eco-designed engineered material based on cross-linked nanocellulose (CNS) was applied for the first time to decontaminate a real matrix from heavy metals (namely Zn, Ni, Cu, and Fe) and other undesired elements (mainly Ba and As) in a lab-scale study, with the aim to design a safe solution for the remediation of contaminated matrices. Contaminated freshwater sludge was treated with CNS coupled with a filtering fine-mesh net, and the obtained waters were tested for acute and sublethal toxicity. In order to check the safety of the proposed treatment system, toxicity tests were conducted by exposing the bacterium Aliivibrio fischeri and the crustacean Heterocypris incongruens, while subtoxicity biomarkers such as lysosomal membrane stability, genetic, and chromosomal damage assessment were performed on the freshwater bivalve Dreissena polymorpha. Dredging sludge was found to be genotoxic, and such genotoxicity was mitigated by the combined use of CNS and a filtering fine-mesh net. Chemical analyses confirmed the results by highlighting the abetment of target contaminants, indicating the present model as a promising tool in freshwater sludge nanoremediation.},

Although there has been an increasing number of these studies in aquatic ecosystems, no data about the MP pollution in zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha, Pallas 1771) living in Beyhan dam lake (Elazığ, Türkiye) are available. This study aimed to investigate the presence of MPs in freshwater mussel species found in this water reservoir. The distribution and characterization of MPs were investigated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in zebra mussel (D. polymorpha) samples at four different stations. A significant difference in the MP presence between the 1st and 4th stations was observed (p {\textless} 0.05). A total of 52 MPs were determined in mussels collected from different stations in Beyhan Dam Lake. A total of 18 MPs of this total (1.80 ± 0.92 MP/individual) were obtained in station 1 and 7 of them (0.70 ± 0.82 MP/individual) were from the 4th station. Results of the MP investigation showed that the dominant color was black, the common size range was 1001–2000 µm, the dominant polymer shape was fiber, and the main polymer type was polypropylene (PP). A positive correlation was found among total MP and factors (length, tissue weight, and MP/individual). The detection of MPs in a freshwater mussel of the Beyhan dam lake can be suggested as a threat indicator and offers the possibility of using D. polymorpha as a bioindicator in the aquatic ecosystems’ MP pollution.},

In Spain and Portugal, it was recorded for the first time in 2003 and 2010, respectively, and its impact on Stone Pine (Pinus pinea) is of major concern. Before developing control measures for this insect pest, it is paramount to clarify its spatiotemporal dynamics of invasion. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to (a) characterise the genetic structure and diversity and (b) invasion pathways of L. occidentalis populations in the Iberian Peninsula. To do so, specimens of L. occidentalis were collected at fourteen sites widely distributed within the Iberian Peninsula. We used mtDNA sequences of Cytochrome b and eleven microsatellite markers to characterise the genetic diversity and the population structure in the Iberian Peninsula. Our genetic results combined with the observational dates strongly support a stratified expansion of L. occidentalis invasion in the Iberian Peninsula proceeding from multiple introductions, including at least one in Barcelona, one in Valencia, and one in the west coast or in the Southeastern region.},

	abstract = {Introduced and geographically expanding populations experience similar eco-evolutionary challenges, including founder events, genetic bottlenecks, and novel environments. Theory predicts that reduced genetic diversity resulting from such phenomena limits the success of introduced populations. Using 1900 SNPs obtained from restriction-site-associated DNA sequencing, we evaluated hypotheses related to the invasion history and connectivity of an invasive population of Tench (Tinca tinca), a Eurasian freshwater fish that has been expanding geographically in eastern North America for three decades. Consistent with the reported history of a single introduction event, our findings suggest that multiple introductions from distinct genetic sources are unlikely as Tench had a small effective population size ({\textasciitilde}114 [95\% CI = 106–123] individuals), no strong population subdivision across time and space, and evidence of a recent genetic bottleneck. The large genetic neighbourhood size (220 km) and weak within-population genetic substructure suggested high connectivity across the invaded range, despite the relatively large area occupied. There was some evidence for a small decay in genetic diversity as the species expanded northward, but not southward, into new habitats. As eradicating the species within a {\textasciitilde}112 km radius would be necessary to prevent recolonization, eradicating Tench is likely not feasible at watershed—and possibly local—scales. Management should instead focus on reducing abundance in priority conservation areas to mitigate adverse impacts. Our study indicates that introduced populations can thrive and exhibit relatively high levels of genetic diversity despite severe bottlenecks ({\textless}1.5\% of the ancestral effective population size) and suggests that landscape heterogeneity and population demographics can generate variability in spatial patterns of genetic diversity within a single range expansion.},

Bilateral maritime trade data is used to (1) identify coastal African countries which were highly connected to select An. stephensi endemic countries, (2) develop a prioritization list of countries based on the likelihood of An. stephensi introduction through maritime trade index (LASIMTI), and (3) use network analysis of intracontinental maritime trade to determine likely introduction pathways. Sudan and Djibouti were ranked as the top two countries with LASIMTI in 2011, which were the first two coastal African countries where An. stephensi was detected. With Djibouti and Sudan included as source populations, 2020 data identify Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Tanzania, and Morocco as the top countries with LASIMTI.

Some organisms, including species of ferns, mollusks, and fish, contain thiamine-degrading enzymes known as thiaminases, and consumption of these organisms can lead to thiamine deficiency in the consumer. Consumption of fish containing thiaminase has led to elevated mortality and recruitment failure in farmed animals and wild salmonine populations around the world. In the North American Great Lakes, consumption of the non-native prey fish alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) by native lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) led to thiamine deficiency in the trout, contributed to elevated fry mortality, and impeded natural population recruitment. Several thiaminases have been genetically characterized in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes, and the source of thiaminase in multicellular organisms has been hypothesized to be gut microflora. In an unexpected discovery, we identified thiaminase I genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) with homology to bacterial tenA thiaminase II. The biochemical activity of zebrafish thiaminase I (GenBank NP\_001314821.1) was confirmed in a recombinant system. Genes homologous to the zebrafish tenA-like thiaminase I were identified in many animals, including common carp (Cyprinus carpio), zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and alewife. Thus, the source of thiaminase I in alewife impacting lake trout populations is likely to be de novo synthesis.},

	abstract = {Valvometry techniques used to monitor bivalve gaping activity have elucidated numerous relationships with environmental fluctuations, along with biological rhythms ranging from sub-daily to seasonal. Thus, a precise understanding of the natural activity of bivalves (i.e., not exposed to stressful environmental variations) is necessary as a baseline for detecting abnormal behaviors (deviations). This knowledge is also needed to reliably interpret observations of bivalve gaping behavior and associated biological processes (e.g., respiration, nutrition) acquired over time-limited periods. With this in mind, we investigated the natural daily gaping activity of the great scallop (Pecten maximus) by continuously monitoring 35 individuals in several individual tanks and in situ (Bay of Saint-Brieuc, Brittany, France) using fully autonomous Hall effect sensors. Our results revealed a circadian cycle (τ = 24.0h) in scallop gaping activity. Despite significant inter-individual variability in mean opening and cycle amplitude, almost all individuals (87.5\%) exhibited nocturnal activity, with valves more open at night than during the day. A shift in light regime in the tanks triggered an instantaneous change in opening pattern, indicating that light levels strongly determine scallop activity. Based on the opening status of scallops, we also identified several gaping behaviors deviating from the regular daily pattern (lack of rhythmicity, high daytime opening), potentially reflecting physiological weakness. While further long-term studies are required to fully understand the natural activity of scallops, these findings pave the way for studies focused on the scallop response to external factors and introduce further research into the detection of abnormal behaviors. Coupling observations of diel valve gaping cycles with other daily variations in organismal and environmental parameters could help explain mechanisms driving the growth patterns of scallops observed in their shell striations. From a technical perspective, our field-based monitoring demonstrates the suitability of autonomous valvometry sensors for studying mobile subtidal bivalve activity in remote offshore environments.},

The results indicate zooplankton abundance was 842.375 to 186,355.0 ind./L. Biomass ranged from 0.3408 to 10.0842 mg/L. Phytoplankton abundance varied between 0.541 × 106 cell/L and 52.340 × 106 cell/L while phytoplankton wet biomass ranged from 0.5123 to 5.6532 mg/L. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that both the zooplankton and phytoplankton total densities were significantly correlated with nutrients (TN, TP, PO43−) and CODcr; zooplankton abundance was significantly correlated with phytoplankton abundance. According to the biodiversity index of Shannon–Wiener, both phytoplankton and zooplankton revealed less biodiversity in the subsidence water region than in the Huihe river system and Xiangshun canal, with values ranging from 0.20 to 2.60 for phytoplankton and 1.18 to 2.45 for zooplankton; however, the phytoplankton community showed lower biodiversity index values compared to the zooplankton community. Overall, the knowledge gleaned from the study of plankton community structure and diversity represents a valuable approach for the evaluation of the ecological conditions within the subsidence lakes, which has significant repercussions for the management and protection of aquatic environments in mining areas.},

This is the first assessment of how suitability of these waters can improve for three important uses: transportation, thermal energy extraction (TEE) and recreation. We assess suitability with Suitability Indices (SIs) and identify which alterations in the water system are needed to improve SI scores in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Ghent, Belgium. The results show spatial variability in suitability scores. Current suitability for transportation is low (SI score = 1) to excellent (SI score = 4), for TEE fair (SI score = 2) to excellent (SI score = 4), and suitability for recreation is low (SI score = 1). Suitability could improve by enlarging specific waterway dimensions, increasing discharge and clarity, and by enhancing microbiological water quality. The same methodology can be applied to optimize designs for new water bodies and for more water uses.},

	abstract = {Liquid biopsy (LB) is a concept that is rapidly gaining ground in the biomedical field. Its concept is largely based on the detection of circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) fragments that are mostly released as small fragments following cell death in various tissues. A small percentage of these fragments are from foreign (nonself) tissues or organisms. In the present work, we applied this concept to mussels, a sentinel species known for its high filtration capacity of seawater. We exploited the capacity of mussels to be used as natural filters to capture environmental DNA fragments of different origins to provide information on the biodiversity of marine coastal ecosystems. Our results showed that hemolymph of mussels contains DNA fragments that varied considerably in size, ranging from 1 to 5 kb. Shotgun sequencing revealed that a significant amount of DNA fragments had a nonself microbial origin. Among these, we found DNA fragments derived from bacteria, archaea, and viruses, including viruses known to infect a variety of hosts that commonly populate coastal marine ecosystems. Taken together, our study shows that the concept of LB applied to mussels provides a rich and yet unexplored source of knowledge regarding the microbial biodiversity of a marine coastal ecosystem.},

	doi = {10.1002/ece3.9557},
	abstract = {In North America, native unionid mussels are imperiled due to factors such as habitat degradation, pollution, and invasive species. One of the most substantial threats is that posed by dreissenid mussels, which are invasive mussels that attach to hard substrates including unionid shells and can restrict movement and feeding of unionids. This dreissenid mussel biofouling of unionids varies spatially in large ecosystems, such as the Great Lakes, with some areas having low enough biofouling to form effective refugia where unionid mussels might persist. Here, we measured biofouling on mussels suspended in cages over the growing season (generally first week in June to last week of August) over 3 years in nearshore areas in Lake Erie (2014–2016), Lake Michigan (Grand Traverse Bay, 2015 and Green Bay, 2016), and Lake Huron (2015). Biofouling varied substantially by years within Lake Erie, with increasingly higher biofouling rates each year. Although dreissenid mussels are present throughout these lakes, we observed very low biofouling in Grand Traverse Bay (Lake Michigan) and Saginaw Bay (Lake Huron), with no dreissenid mussels in 8 of 9 sites across these two bays. Sampling in the rivermouth of the Fox River (Wisconsin) and the Maumee River (Ohio) both showed very high biofouling in areas adjacent to the outlet of these tributaries into Green Bay and Maumee Bay (Lake Erie), respectively. These watersheds are dominated by agriculture, and we would expect high growth of primary producers (i.e., mussel food) and primary consumers (unionids and zebra mussels) in these areas compared to the other sampled bays or the open waters of the Great Lakes.},

However, to date, no comprehensive quantifications of the reported economic costs of these species have been done. Here, we used the InvaCost database on the monetary impact of invasive alien species to identify the costs of those facilitated by three major canal systems: the European Inland Canals, Suez Canal, and Panama Canal. While we identified a staggering number of species having spread via these systems, monetary costs have been reported only for a few. A total of \$33.6 million in costs have been reported from species linked to European Inland Canals (the fishhook waterflea Cercopagis pengoi and the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha) and \$8.6 million linked to the Suez Canal (the silver-cheeked toadfish Lagocephalus sceleratus, the lionfish Pterois miles, and the nomad jellyfish Rhopilema nomadica), but no recorded costs were found for species facilitated by the Panama Canal. We thus identified a pervasive lack of information on the monetary costs of invasions facilitated by canals and highlighted the uneven distribution of costs.},

To date, Poland represents the most north-eastward distribution area in Europe, where the species occurs in ecosystems with natural water temperature regimes. The ecological plasticity of P. virginalis and its obligate parthenogenetic reproduction make this crayfish an exceptional invader. The crayfish may have detrimental effects on the native invertebrates, amphibians, and fish, and alter the state of the entire ecosystem. Therefore, we investigated the presence of the species in the nature reserve of Pojezierze Łęczyńskie Landscape Park after a suspected P. virginalis individual was found by a local citizen. The nature reserve also includes an area designated to protect native amphibians and turtles. Our study revealed the presence of a thriving population of P. virginalis in the protected area and clear indications of its impact on native and invasive species, both in aquatic and terrestrial environments. If no action is taken, the species will likely expand to other water bodies across the country. An extensive sensibilization campaign allowed us to find additional invaded areas and significantly contribute to the effective ban of this and other invasive crayfish species from private and commercial online trade. Raising public awareness and banning invasive crayfish species trade is essential for successfully detecting and preventing further introductions.},

At Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge (Central North Pacific), native invasive corallimorpharians, Rhodactis howesii, have smothered live native corals since 2007. Laboratory and field trials were conducted evaluating two control methods to remove R. howesii overgrowing the benthos at Palmyra Atoll (Palmyra): 1) paste mixed with chlorine, citric acid, or sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and 2) hot water. Paste mixed with NaOH had the most efficacious kill in mesocosm trials and resulted in {\textgreater} 90\% kill over a 98 m² area three days after treatment. Hot water at 82°C was most effective in mesocosms; in the field hot water was less effective than paste but still resulted in a kill of ca. 75\% over 100 m² three days after treatment. Costs of paste and heat (excluding capital equipment and costs of regulatory approval should this method be deployed large scale) were \$70/m² and \$59/m² respectively. Invasive R. howesii currently occupy ca 5,800,000 m² of reef at Palmyra with ca. 276,000 m² comprising heavily infested areas. Several potential management strategies are discussed based on costs of treatment, area covered, and the biology of the invasion. The methods described here expand the set of tools available to manage invasive species in complex marine habitats.},

	abstract = {Early detection of dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis bugensis) is crucial to mitigating the economic and environmental impacts of an infestation. Plankton tow sampling is a common method used for early detection of dreissenid mussels, but little is known about the sampling intensity required for a high probability of early detection using the method. We used implicit dynamic occupancy models to estimate plankton tow detection probabilities of dreissenid mussels from a long-term data set containing plankton tow samples collected across central and western United States. We fit models using a) the entire data set, including water bodies with unknown occupancy status in addition to heavily infested water bodies, b) a data subset that included water bodies with paired water temperature data, and c) a data subset that included water bodies with lower dreissenid densities. For the entire data set, we found that estimated detection probabilities varied by water body size and ranged from approximately 0.10 to 0.86. For the water temperature subset, we observed the same pattern between detection probability and water body size as we did for the full data but additionally found that the estimated detection probabilities were much higher when water temperatures were above 12 °C. For the lower dreissenid density subset, we found that the estimated probability of detecting dreissenid mussels with a single aggregated plankton tow sample was near zero. Given these estimates, we conclude that the number of aggregated plankton tow samples taken per water body in the data is far fewer than the number needed to ensure a high probability of detecting dreissenid mussels, especially if they are at low densities. We summarize the analyses with a discussion of plankton tow sampling protocol changes needed to improve estimates of dreissenid detection probabilities.},

The study was conducted from October 2017 to July 2020 in the east of Bou-Ismail Bay. The mussel spat were obtained from four origin sites (Tlemcen, Tenes, Ain Tagourait and the study site) and were seeded on three spat sizes (10–30, 30–60 and {\textgreater}60 mm). The production performance of this species was analysed on 284 random mussel plots using average physical product (APP), gain and loss rates, condition index (CI), percentage of edibility (PE) and shell thickness index (STI). Apart from the CI and loss rate, the performance indicators showed significant differences according to spat size and source (p {\textless} 0.05). Overall, the highest APP (4.3) was recorded for the small seeded mussels (10–30) mm and for those originating from Tlemcen, near finfish cages (APP = 4.14). These individuals exhibited more efficient growth and physiology for commercial size and performed better than the spat collected at the study site. The results can be considered a valid contribution to best farming practice for optimising the production of this species in Algeria. It also contributes to the development of integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA) methodology, which is suitable for use in the oligotrophic Western Mediterranean.},

	abstract = {The freshwater mussel Echyridella (also known as kākahi) is the only freshwater mussel found in New Zealand's lakes and rivers and is endemic to the country. They play a crucial role in freshwater ecosystems and have high cultural significance. The three putative species of Echyridella are all classified as at risk. Monitoring is required to enhance knowledge on their distribution and to provide management, but conventional approaches (diving, wading, or swimming and visually looking for mussels) are time‐consuming, costly, and require good visibility. The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) in combination with PCR techniques offer advantages over conventional methods. In this study, we developed a triplex droplet digital PCR assay, targeting a region of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene, that differentiates all three kākahi species. The limits of quantification using gblocks were 0.6 × 10−03–6 × 10−03 fg/µl, yielding 2–8 copies/reaction, and for tissue DNA 10,000–100,000 fg/µl, yielding 9–15 copies/reaction. The method was applied to water samples from 48 lakes, lagoons, or ponds and two samples from streams. A total of 58\% of samples from lakes, lagoons, or ponds and all samples from the streams were positive for kākahi. Sediment samples (n = 15) were also tested. Only those collected in close proximity ({\textless}1 m) to living kākahi were positive highlighting the patchy distribution of eDNA in sediment. This new assay will assist in determining the current distribution of kākahi at large temporal and spatial scales and has the potential to be used for the assessment of historic distributions as well.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic structures can form novel ecosystem niches. Invasive species are often particularly successful in occupying these habitats and utilize them as beachheads for further spread. The invasive round goby (Neogobius melanostomus, Pallas 1814), an inherently bottom‐dwelling fish, uses vertical harbor walls as habitat, enabling them to reach boats (i.e., potential translocation vectors). To evaluate the relevance of vertical habitat use for population dynamics and translocation, we exemplary investigated a population of round gobies in a harbor ecosystem. Specifically, we investigated differences in trophic niche characteristics, individual trophic specialization, phenotypic traits, and breeding frequency in wall versus bottom‐dwelling round gobies. Habitat‐characteristic dietary signatures indicated habitat partitioning during the breeding season. Trophic niches overlapped but were clearly distinguishable between the habitats: Walls were inhabited by 1.4 times more trophic generalists than specialists, while the bottom was inhabited by 2.1 times more trophic specialists. Breeding frequency was 24 times higher on the walls than on the bottom. After the reproductive season, we found a higher similarity in trophic ecology of gobies inhabiting the two habitats, and differences in abundance, size, and condition. These results are in line with winter migrations to deeper habitats, which are common in round gobies in lentic and marine ecosystems. Our results suggest a high potential for microgeographic adaptation to either horizontal or vertical habitat use in invasive round gobies. We demonstrated that male gobies using the walls during the breeding season are larger and heavier, suggesting that wall climbing may select for more competitive individuals. Additionally, the overall abundance of round gobies likely increases with the additional use of vertical habitat space, which may lead to higher propagule pressure. The ability to exploit anthropogenic habitats, and a higher translocation probability of competitive individuals, can contribute to the invasion success of round gobies in anthropogenically influenced aquatic systems.},

Among the most important are the following: (1) the inclusion of actual damage costs together with various ancillary expenditures which may or may not be indicative of the real economic damage due to NIS; (2) the inclusion of the costs of unnecessary or counterproductive control initiatives; (3) the inclusion of controversial NIS-related costs whose economic impacts are questionable; (4) the assessment of the negative impacts only, ignoring the positive ones that most NIS have on the economy, either directly or through their ecosystem services. Such estimates necessarily arrive at negative and often highly inflated values, do not reflect the net damage and economic losses due to NIS, and can significantly misguide management and resource allocation decisions.

	abstract = {Habitat loss, the introduction of invasive species, and climate change due to human activity have threatened many freshwater unionid bivalves worldwide. Unionid bivalves represent important members of freshwater ecosystems, providing bitterling fish with spawning grounds and contributing to water clarification via the filtration of suspended solids. This study examined an environmental DNA (eDNA) approach for monitoring the unionid bivalve Nodularia nipponensis in a lake environment. We developed oligonucleotide primers for the specific detection of mitochondrial DNA from N. nipponensis and evaluated the decay and release rates of eDNA in a laboratory tank experiment under two bivalve densities (49 and 164 individuals m−2) selected to ensure sufficient eDNA yields. The eDNA release rate was weakly and positively correlated with bivalve density but strongly and positively correlated with inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus excretion from the bivalve. In a eutrophic lake, Lake Hachiro, 67\% of the samples (16 out of 24) collected from June to July yielded detectable amounts of eDNA and were not detected at all in May and August (0 out of 20). This difference was probably due to the release of N. nipponensis glochidium larvae. During these months, unionid glochidia adhered to bundles of polyvinylidene chloride fibers placed on the lake bottom for 8 h, confirmed by microscopic inspection. We successfully obtained N. nipponensis eDNA from all bundles examined over the months, demonstrating the efficacy of bundle capture in quantifying unionid bivalve eDNA. Our eDNA‐based technique with specific oligonucleotide primers and fiber bundles may be a promising tool for monitoring N. nipponensis in freshwater environments. Fiber bundles are useful for tracing eDNA derived from glochidium larvae, even at low unionid bivalve densities, which may be conducive to conservation efforts.},

The discovery of live C. fluminea in a central Minnesota lake absent any known thermal refuge in 2020 presented an opportunity to further evaluate the overwinter survival and population structure of C. fluminea at the presumed edge of their potential range. The population was monitored from December 2020 through September 2021 alongside water temperature to better understand at which temperatures C. fluminea survived and if the population structure suggested reproduction occurring in the lake. We documented live C. fluminea in temperatures as low as 0.3°C. Shell size of recovered individuals suggested multiple cohorts, and the appearance of a new cohort at the end of the study, indicating active reproduction in the lake and suggesting the population had likely been present in the lake for at least two winters by the conclusion of the study period. Our findings provide evidence of the survival below historically documented lower lethal temperature limits and suggests adaptations to modeling predicting suitable habitat, both present and in a changing climate, are necessary to better assess risk of invasion by this species.},

However, many ship owners are still not able to comply with the regulation due to the presence of several challenges. Hence, this study evaluates the challenges hindering the Ballast Water Management System (BWMS) compliance of shipping operators in Nigeria from installation of BWTSs. Based on the expert interview and industry review, technical challenges (TCs), environmental challenges (ENCs), economic challenges (ECCs), and other challenges (OCs) were identified as the major challenges responsible for the non-compliance among the Nigerian shipping companies. The Analytical Hierarchy Process was used for evaluating and ranking the various challenges, and the results obtained indicate that OCs, which include external and internal influences on ship operators, ship type, age, and trading route, obtained the highest rank (0.3666), followed by ECCs (0.3648) and TCs obtaining the third rank (0.1456). ENCs were regarded as the least concern (0.1223) for shipping operators in the region in their decision to comply with the BWMS by installing BWTS onboard their ship. This study will help decision-makers in prioritizing the management measure and taking policy decision that can promote the compliance among shipping companies in the region.},

	abstract = {Environmental (e)DNA tools are sensitive and cost-effective for early detection of invasive species. However, the uncertainty associated with the interpretation of positive eDNA detections makes it challenging to determine appropriate natural resource management responses. Multiple sources of error can give rise to positive detections of eDNA in a sample when individuals of that species are not present at the site or a widespread infestation is not imminent. Acting on an erroneous eDNA inference could result in needless costs or reductions in desirable resources. Alternatively, failure to rapidly act on eDNA results that truly indicate invader presence could compound negative impacts and lead to high, long-term costs to manage infestations. We used a structured decision making (SDM) process, which incorporates tradeoffs and uncertainties, to evaluate appropriate response actions following hypothetical eDNA detections of invasive dreissenid mussel (Dreissena spp.) eDNA in Jordanelle Reservoir, Utah (USA). We worked with decision-makers and stakeholders to identify objectives and discrete management action alternatives to assess consequences and tradeoffs. Alternatives ranged from no action to intensive and expensive control efforts. The best performing alternative was delayed containment described by immediate attempts to confirm the eDNA detections using non-molecular sampling techniques followed by mandatory watercraft exit inspections to prevent dreissenid mussel spread to regional water bodies. Non-molecular sampling increased public support for management by demonstrating a commitment to monitor the invasion state before action, whereas containment decreased likelihood of regional spread to other waters. Delayed containment had the lowest downside risk, and the highest upside gains relative to other alternative actions. Sensitivity analyses showed our results to be robust to parameter and outcome uncertainty.},

Costs were heavily biased taxonomically and spatially, dominated by two families, Dreissenidae and Cyrenidae (Corbiculidae), and largely reported in North America. The greatest share of reported costs (\$ 31.5 billion) did not make the distinction between damage and management. However, of those that did, damages and resource losses were one order of magnitude higher (\$ 30.5 billion) than control or preventative measures (\$ 1.7 billion). Moreover, although many impacted socio‐economic sectors lacked specification, the largest shares of costs were incurred by authorities and stakeholders (\$ 27.7 billion, e.g., public and private sector interventions) and through impacts on public and social welfare (\$ 10.1 billion, e.g., via power/drinking water plant and irrigation system damage) in North America. Average cost estimates over the entire period amounted to approximately \$ 1.6 billion per year, most of which was incurred in North America.Main conclusionsOur results highlight the burgeoning economic threat caused by invasive freshwater bivalves, offering a strong economic incentive to invest in preventative management such as biosecurity and rapid response eradications. Even if the damages and resource losses are severely understated because economic impacts are lacking for most invaded countries and invasive bivalve species, these impacts are substantial and likely growing.},

	abstract = {As strategic transport infrastructures, canals provide wide-ranging economic benefits as well as save energy and reduce CO2 emissions. At the same time, by connecting previously biogeographically-isolated systems, they serve as corridors for the introduction and spread of aquatic alien species, potentially leading to unforeseen ecological and economic impacts. To date, there has been no attempt to quantify the reported economic costs of these species. Here, we used the InvaCost database on the monetary impact of invasive alien species to identify the costs of species whose introduction and spread have been linked to the operation of three major canal systems: the European Inland Canals, Suez Canal and Panama Canal. While we identified a staggering number of alien species that have been spread via these systems, monetary costs have been reported only for a few of these known invasive aliens. A total of \$33.6 million in costs have been reported from invasive species linked to European Inland Canals (the fishhook waterflea Cercopagis pengoi and the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha) and \$8.6 million linked to the Suez Canal (the silver-cheeked toadfish Lagocephalus sceleratus, the lionfish Pterois miles, and the nomad jellyfish Rhopilema nomadica), but no recorded costs were yet recorded for species which invasion was facilitated by the Panama Canal. We thus identified a pervasive lack of information on the monetary costs of invasions facilitated by anthropogenically-created corridors, such as canals. In highlighting the uneven and lacking distribution of costs, we suggest those benefiting from the creation of canals are not necessarily the same as those paying the incurred costs, and urge greater recognition and reporting of impacts.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.13161},
	abstract = {The late goldenrod (Soldiago gigantea Aiton; Asteraceae) is one of the most abundant invasive species in various types of habitats. Its long-creeping plagiotropic rhizomes enable the plant to build up dense, monospecific stands within a short time. Particularly in nature conservation areas, the invasion of goldenrod can cause severe disruptions in the naturally occuring mutualims between plants, insects and higher trophic levels, subsequently impeding the achievement of nature conservation goals. As management options of goldenrod in nature conservation areas are limited, this three-year study aimed to test the effectiveness of three management treatments (two-time mowing, triticale cultivation, and reverse rotary cutting) on four different sites in the Austrian Donau-Auen National Park. The number and height of goldenrod shoots were recorded three times a year on twelve permanent trial plots on each site to test for the effectiveness of the treatments. In addition, vegetation surveys were performed to observe the recovery potential of native plant species. Even though the three-years mowing and the triticale cultivation reduced goldenrod by 95.6\% and 97.2\% resp., we could find no relation between the effectiveness of the treatment and the intensity of disturbance created by the control option. On the contrary, with a reduction of only 5.4\% in goldenrod density the most intensive treatment, the rotary cutting, showed the lowest efficiency. The highest positive effect on the re-establishment of native plant species was recorded with two mowing events per year. Even though the study revealed that certain management options have the potential to effectively reduce goldenrod and to simultaneously increase the establishment success of native species, results can only be seen as so-called snapshots. For example, as shown on site EJW one unforeseeable wild boar digging event transformed a 84.5\% reduction into a 4.7\% increase in goldenrod density. Therefore, a proper and regular monitoring is essential to be able to react to the effects of unpredictable events that can have severe impact on vegetation dynamics.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to identify the importance of ecological factors to distribution patterns of the invasive Clam (Corbicula fluminea) relative to native mussels (family: Unionidae) across seven rivers within the Mobile and Tennessee basins, Southeast United States. We quantitatively surveyed dense, diverse native mussel aggregations across 20 river reaches and estimated mussel density, biomass, and species richness along with density of invasive C. fluminea (hereafter Corbicula). We measured substrate particle size, velocity, and depth in quadrats where animals were collected. Additionally, we characterized reach scale environmental parameters including seston quantity and quality (\% Carbon, \% Nitrogen, \% Phosphorous), water chemistry (ammonium [NH4+], soluble reactive phosphorous [SRP]), and watershed area and land cover. Using model selection, logistic regression, and multivariate analysis, we characterized habitat features and their association to invasive Corbicula within mussel beds. We found that Corbicula were more likely to occur and more abundant in quadrats with greater mussel biomass, larger substrate size, faster water velocity, and shallower water depth. At the reach scale, Corbicula densities increased where particle sizes were larger. Mussel richness, density, and biomass increased with watershed area. Water column NH4+ increased at reaches with more urban land cover. No land cover variables influenced Corbicula populations or mussel communities. The strong overlapping distribution of Corbicula and mussels support the hypothesis that Corbicula are not necessarily limited by habitat factors and may be passengers of change in rivers where mussels have declined due to habitat degradation. Whether Corbicula is facilitated by mussels or negatively interacts with mussels in these systems remains to be seen. Focused experiments that manipulate patch scale variables would improve our understanding of the role of species interactions (e.g., competition, predation, facilitation) or physical habitat factors in influencing spatial overlap between Corbicula and native mussels.},

	abstract = {Coastal waters of Lake Superior are generally inhospitable to the establishment of invasive Dreissena spp. mussels (both D. polymorpha and D. bugensis). Dreissena have inhabited the Saint Louis River estuary (SLRE; largest commercial port in the Laurentian Great Lakes) for over 3 decades, but only in the last few years have small colonies been found in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore (APIS), an archipelago situated 85 km to the east of SLRE) A 2017 survey determined a low abundance Dreissena spatial distribution in APIS, with the largest colonies on the north and west islands which suggested potential veliger transport from the SLRE via longshore currents. Our objective in this study was to determine if Dreissena veligers are transported by currents at low densities along the south shore of Lake Superior from the SLRE to APIS. To do so, we used both eDNA (water and passive substrate samples) and zooplankton collection methods at 8 sites evenly spaced between the SLRE and APIS with 3 sampling times over 5 weeks. Dreissena veligers were consistently detected along the south shore, although at low abundances (veligers per m3 range=0 – 690, median=8), and for every 1 km increase in distance from the SLRE, both veliger counts and water eDNA copy numbers decreased on average by 5\% and 7\%, respectively. D. polymorpha (suited to estuary habitats) was detected 2 times more than D. bugensis (better suited to deep-lake habitats). There was not a trend in the veliger size distribution along the south shore, and temperature and calcium concentrations fluctuated around the threshold for Dreissena veliger and adult development, averaging 11.0 ℃ and 14.8 ppm, respectively. Three zooplankton taxa representative of the estuary community--Daphnia retrocurva, Diaphanosoma birgei, and Mesocyclops copepodites--decreased as the distance from the SLRE increased mirroring Dreissena veliger abundance patterns. Findings represent multiple sources of evidence of a propagule “conveyor belt” for Dreissena along the south shore of Lake Superior. We conclude that veligers are functioning as a propagule, using coastal currents to spread from the point of invasion, thereby traversing coastal habitat previously reported as inhospitable to distant habitats suitable for colonization.},

Several studies have evaluated the diversity of these communities, but very few have analyzed the survival of organisms after their voyages into different and potentially inhospitable conditions. This factor is important to consider because the last port of call approach for risk assessments assumes that if the conditions observed in the last port of call are different from those observed in a receiving port, risks are diminished or null. Using an innovative experimental system, we tested the survival and recovery of the marine blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and the freshwater zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) by exposing them to adverse salinity conditions at varying temperatures to simulate ships and boats transiting to ports or marinas with contrasting environmental conditions. Both mussel species, which are well-known for their adaptability to new environments as aquatic non-indigenous species, survived better at colder temperatures, with blue mussels surviving up to 14 days in freshwater, and zebra mussels up to 8 days in marine water. This highlights the importance of considering the resistance of fouling organisms to adverse conditions in vector and species risk assessments.},

Here we studied a large lake in Minnesota, USA, that experienced a simultaneous surge in invasive zebra mussel and spiny water flea populations. A long-term (2000–2018) dataset offered a rare opportunity to assess whole-ecosystem shifts following the co-invasion. Within two years, the native crustacean zooplankton community declined abruptly in density and productivity (−93\% and −91\%, respectively). Summer phytoplankton abundance and water clarity remained stable across the time series, an unexpected outcome given the high density of zebra mussels in the lake. Observational data and modeling indicate that removal of native herbivorous zooplankton by the predatory spiny water flea reduced zooplankton grazing pressure enough to compensate new grazing losses due to zebra mussels, resulting in a zero net effect on phytoplankton abundance and water clarity despite a wholesale shift in secondary production from the pelagic to the benthic food web. This study reveals the extent of direct and indirect effects of two aquatic invaders on food-web processes that cancel shifts in water clarity, a highly valued ecosystem service.Observational data and modeling are used to reveal the extent of direct and indirect effects of spiny water flea and zebra mussels on food-web processes that cancel shifts in water clarity.},

	abstract = {Background 
Predicting invasiveness requires an understanding of the propensity of a given species to thrive in areas with novel ecological challenges. Evaluation of realized niche shift of an invasive species in its invasive range, detecting the main drivers of the realized niche shift, and predicting the potential distribution of the species can provide important information for the management of populations of invasive species and the conservation of biodiversity. The Australian redback spider, Latrodectus hasselti, is a widow spider that is native to Australia and established in Japan, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia. We used ecological niche models and ordinal comparisons in an integrative method to compare the realized niches of native and invasive populations of this spider species. We also assessed the impact of several climatic predictor variables and human activity on this niche shift. We hypothesized that human impact is important for successful establishment of this anthropophilic species, and that climatic predictor variables may determine suitable habitat and thus predict invasive ranges.
Results
Our models showed that L. hasselti distributions are positively influenced by human impact in both of the native and invasive ranges. Maximum temperature was the most important climatic variable in predictions of the distribution of native populations, while precipitation seasonality was the most important in predictions of invasive populations. The realized niche of L. hasselti in its invasive range differed from that in its native range, indicating possible realized niche shift.
Conclusions
We infer that a preference for human-disturbed environments may underlie invasion and establishment in this spider species, as anthropogenic habitat modifications could provide shelters from unsuitable climatic conditions and extreme climatic stresses to the spiders. Because Australia and the countries in which the species is invasive have differing climates, differences in the availability of certain climatic conditions could have played a role in the realized niche shift of L. hasselti.},

	abstract = {Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) are a top predator native to the Laurentian Great Lakes, with a wide distribution in North America. Our understanding of Smallmouth Bass ecology is extensive, although primarily based on research from smaller inland lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. In Lake Ontario, there is an urgent need for additional research on this species due to the apparent declines and invasive species-mediated changes in the Smallmouth Bass population in recent years, documented by provincial and state agencies. A better understanding of the status of Smallmouth Bass populations is especially important in the Southern Great Lakes since pressure from recreational anglers also appears to be increasing. The objective of the present study was to examine whether a novel acoustic telemetry approach could be used to obtain information on the spatial ecology of Smallmouth Bass in the eastern basin of Lake Ontario. Near continuous detections were recorded for eleven Smallmouth Bass, expanding the practical toolbox of passive acoustic telemetry in large lake ecosystems. The present study also provides evidence that this species exhibits local residency to a greater degree than previously understood. Smallmouth Bass depth use and activity rate varied seasonally, with winter characterized by deeper depths and lower vertical and horizontal activity relative to the summer period. Home range size decreased during the overwintering period, with simultaneous shifts in home range centrality towards deeper bathymetric features surrounding the study site. The use of a smallscale passive array to study a nearshore predator in the Great Lakes is a novel approach that has improved our understanding of Smallmouth Bass ecology. The findings of this research also have important implications for assessing, managing and conserving the Smallmouth Bass populations in the Great Lakes.},

	abstract = {Lake Huron has undergone dramatic and well-documented lake-wide food web changes as a result of non-native species introductions. Coastal beaches, which serve as nursery habitats for native and introduced species, are, however, relatively poorly studied. Our objective was to assess fish assemblages of beach habitats in western Lake Huron and compare species composition pre- (1993) and post-invasion (2012) of dreissenid mussels and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Nearshore beach fish assemblages were sampled by nighttime beach seining during spring and summer in 1993 and 2012 in the western basin of Lake Huron along the Michigan shoreline. Catch rates were considerably higher, but there were fewer species present in 2012 than in 1993. The composition of species changed dramatically from a cold- and cool-water species assemblage in 1993 (dominated by alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius), and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), as well as Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)) to a cool- and warm-water species assemblage in 2012 (dominated by cyprinids, round goby (Nogobius melanstomus), and yellow perch (Perca flavescens)). The observed rise in catch rate and shift in species composition appears related to the introduction of invasive species as well as an on-going warming pattern in nearshore waters.},

	abstract = {The estuarine ecosystems of Southern California serve numerous ecological and commercial functions but are under increasing anthropogenic pressure. Pollution and the expansion of nonindigenous species challenge these already vulnerable locales and the native species that inhabit them. The purpose of this study was to quantify the different types and concentrations of chemical contaminants detected in oyster tissue and surrounding sediment from Southern California estuaries. Additionally, transcriptomic analysis was utilized to investigate differential gene expression to compare site-specific and species-specific stress responses between a native and non-native oyster species. Tissue samples of the native Ostrea lurida and the non-native Crassostrea gigas as well as sediment samples were collected from six different sites across four estuaries. Tissue and sediment samples underwent chemical contaminant analysis to quantify concentrations of trace metal and organic contaminants while gill tissue samples underwent RNA-sequencing for differential gene expression analysis. Concentrations of various trace metal and organic analytes exceeded screening levels at multiple sites with sediment and C. gigas tissue varying statistically in their contaminant levels across sites. Contaminant types and concentrations reported here align with findings of past studies, indicating that various contaminants remain throughout Southern California estuaries in both biotic and environmental compartments. Notably, tissue and sediment samples from the San Diego Bay Boathouse (SDBBH) site displayed qualitatively the highest concentrations of PCBs, highlighting the need for further monitoring and assessment of legacy contaminants in estuarine habitats. Transcriptomic analysis revealed altered expression of various genes involved in oxidative stress and xenobiotic biotransformation. Specifically, we observed increased expression of glutathione-S-transferase in both O. lurida and C. gigas from SDBBH, which suggests increased PCB concentrations may be impacting the health of both oysters. Differential gene expression analysis between species was evaluated based on patterns of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gene ontology (GO) terms. Overall, no GO terms were shared between the two species which provides evidence for a species-specific stress response. C. gigas exhibited enrichment of GO terms involved in ATP production and transporter pathways while O. lurida exhibited changes in GO terms involved in cellular homeostasis. These findings demonstrate that oysters throughout Southern California estuaries with varying contaminant levels displayed differential gene expression and a species-specific response observed in C. gigas may confer a higher tolerance to stressful conditions.},

	abstract = {Simple SummaryPrior to the invasion and spread of Dreissena mussels in the late 1980s, the nearshore waters of the Laurentian Great Lakes were home to diverse assemblages of native aquatic insects, including the net-spinning caddisfly Hydropsyche alternans, which occurred in rocky surf-exposed habitat throughout the system from Lake Superior downstream to Lake Ontario. These surf zone caddisflies are still abundant in the largely Dreissena-free waters of Lake Superior where the present study was conducted. They have not been reported in the lakes below Lake Superior for decades, and are presumed to have been extirpated from Dreissena-infested habitats. The ecological profile presented here documents the life history of H. alternans in Lake Superior, and reveals details of its feeding biology that shed light on the roles that surf zone net-spinners play in the native nearshore food webs of the Great Lakes. The H. alternans life history in Lake Superior begins in mid-summer shortly after oviposition, which features females swimming to surf-exposed lake bottom substrates. Larval development takes approximately 10 months, but most of it occurs during their first 100 days. Adult emergence is broadly synchronous, with large numbers present from the summer solstice through mid-July. Gut content analyses showed that larvae opportunistically feed on algal, animal, and detrital material of aquatic and terrestrial origin. δ13C and δ15N stable isotope data indicate that they function as omnivores that link coastal, nearshore, and pelagic food webs. These energetic links, and the very existence of surf zone insect assemblages in the Great Lakes, depend on the Dreissena populations in Lake Superior remaining relatively small and isolated.AbstractWe studied the life history, diet, and trophic ecology of Hydropsyche alternans in four rocky sites located along the south-central coast of Lake Superior. The H. alternans life history and broad trophic niche space were similar to those of its riverine relatives. Quantitative sampling over the course of one ice-free season revealed that most individuals lived univoltine life histories that featured early to mid-summer mating, and oviposition and rapid growth and development through summer into fall. Most individuals overwintered as ultimate or penultimate larval instars. Pupation followed ice-out in the spring. Gut content sampling and δ13C and δ15N stable isotope analyses indicated that the typical larval diet is a mix of benthic, pelagic, and terrestrial food resources, including diatoms, small arthropods, sloughed periphyton, and in one site, fugal hyphae apparently of foredune origin. As a suspension-feeding omnivore that relies on waves and currents to deliver food to its nets, H. alternans larvae form energetic links between coastal, nearshore, and offshore food webs. These connections have been lost throughout the lower Laurentian Great Lakes as a consequence of the invasion and spread of Dreissena mussels.},

	abstract = {The recent genetic revolution through the analysis of aquatic environmental DNA (eDNA) has become a powerful tool for improving the detection of rare and/or invasive species. For the majority of eDNA studies, genetic assays are designed to target mitochondrial genes commonly referred to as “barcode” regions. However, unlike the typical structure of an animal mitochondrial genome, those for the invasive zebra and quagga mussels are greatly expanded with large extended tandem repeat regions. These sections of repeated DNA can appear hundreds of times within the genome compared to a single copy for the mitochondrial barcode genes. This higher number of target copies per mitochondrial genome presents an opportunity to increase eDNA assay sensitivity for these species. Therefore, we designed and evaluated new eDNA assays to target the extended repeat sections for both zebra and quagga mussels. These assays lower the limit of detection of genomic DNA by 100-fold for zebra mussels and 10-fold for quagga mussels. Additionally, these newly developed assays provided longer durations of detection during degradation mesocosm experiments and greater sensitivity for eDNA detection from water samples collected across western Lake Erie compared to standard assays targeting mitochondrial genes. This work illustrates how understanding the complete genomic structure of an organism can improve eDNA analysis.},

	abstract = {The invasion of the Laurentian Great Lakes by aquatic invasive species (AIS) has been the subject of investigation for decades, due to their dramatic alterations to the ecosystem and high economic costs. Two AIS with the largest impacts are dreissenid zebra and quagga mussels, and though these species have been studied extensively, questions remain about what factors control their distributions, and whether lake warming will alter these distributions. Species distribution models (SDMs) offer a powerful tool to examine the relationship between species presences and environmental variables, which are typically bioclimactic data. The creation of the Aquatic Habitat (AqHab) dataset containing biological, chemical, geomorphological, hydrological variables within the Great Lakes provides a novel opportunity to build models that do not rely on atmospheric climate proxies. We hypothesized that the high-resolution AqHab dataset would produce SDMs with improved predictive capabilities for dreissenids than SDMs constructed with BioClim covariates. We also predicted niche differences between the dreissenids would be reflected by the models. SDM models were fitted using two algorithms: Maximum Entropy (MaxENT) and Boosted Regression Trees (BRT). AqHab models better predicted quagga mussel presence than BioClim models. Dreissenid niche differences, such as zebra preferring shallow, warm waters and quaggas preferring deep, cold waters, were apparent from all models. Our results imply that aquatic species distribution models may be improved with the addition of aquatic habitat environmental layers.},

Here, we analyzed differences between bivalve abundances in lake outlets with varying environmental conditions such as the Carlson Index (trophy status), depth, width, current velocity, bed vegetation coverage, and type of bottom substrate. The results showed that the zebra mussel inhabits outlets that provide food (high trophy outlets) and have a mineral bed and a medium current velocity (ca. 0.2–0.3 m/s). The following main factors seem to be favorable for colonizing such outlets: (1) easy access to high amounts of food due to the increased density of the suspension drifting from the lake and (2) easy transport of the zebra mussel larvae from the lake to the downstream. The zebra mussel larvae drifting with the current may colonize the downstream. An increase in lake trophy may indirectly cause an increase in biological invasions in rivers.},

	abstract = {The American charru mussel Mytella strigata (Hanley, 1843) is an invasive species of great concern along the shores of North America and Asia. As with most invasive mussels, it is very difficult to eradicate once established. Surveillance therefore plays a vital role in controlling its spread. Molecular tools like environmental DNA (eDNA) have proved to be useful in recent years to assist in the early detection and management of invasive species, with considerable advantages over conventional methods like substrate monitoring and sampling, which can be relatively laborious and time-intensive. This technique can be particularly useful in the initial stages of invasion when the population density is often too low to be detected by visual surveys alone. In the present study, we developed a species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach targeting a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) DNA fragment aimed at detecting the presence of M. strigata from water samples. We also investigated the relationship between mussel cover and eDNA concentration. Our approach was tested on coastal seawater samples from 14 sites in Singapore, supported by conventional visual quadrat surveys. The results showed clear, positive M. strigata eDNA detection for all sites where this species was observed visually during field surveys. However, there was a weakly negative correlation between percent mussel cover and eDNA concentration, indicating that mussel abundance could not be estimated reliably using seawater eDNA alone. Nevertheless, this study underscores the effectiveness of eDNA in informing the presence and distribution of M. strigata along extensive coastlines comprising different habitats. This approach contributes to a robust toolkit for routine surveillance at sites where invasion may be impending to control the spread of the invasive mussel.},

Little research has examined in situ microplastic ingestion by dreissenid mussels, or the relationship between microplastics and chemical contaminants. We measured microplastics and chemical contaminants in mussel tissue from Milwaukee Harbor (Lake Michigan, USA) harvested from reference locations and sites influenced by wastewater effluent and urban river discharge. Mussels were deployed in cages in the summer of 2018, retrieved after 30 and 60 days, sorted by size class, and analyzed for microplastics and body burdens of three classes of contaminants: alkylphenols, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and petroleum biomarkers. Microplastics in mussels were higher in the largest mussels at the wastewater-adjacent site after 30 days deployment. However, there was no distinction among sites for microplastics in smaller mussels, and no differences among sites after 60 days of deployment. Microplastics and chemical contaminants in mussels were not correlated. Microplastics have a diversity of intrinsic and extrinsic factors which influence their ingestion, retention, and egestion by mussels, and which vary relative to chemicals. While dreissenid mussels may not serve as plastic pollution biomonitors like they can for chemical contaminants, microplastics in dreissenid mussels are widespread, variable, and have unknown effects on physiology, mussel-mediated ecosystem processes, and lake food webs. These data will inform our understanding of the spatial distribution of microplastics in urban freshwaters, the role of dreissenid mussels in plastic budgets, and models for the fate of plastic pollution.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenically influenced habitats are becoming increasingly impacted by multiple invasive species that can regionally control main ecological processes and functions. Management requires predictions of invasive species’ effects, but multiple invasions may cause unpredictable outcomes, for example, synergistic impacts or interactions among trophic levels causing trophic cascades. The Baltic Sea is prone to species invasions that increasingly occur at multiple trophic levels. We used a laboratory experiment to test whether multiple invasive predators may cause interactive effects in the Baltic Sea. In aquaria, we simulated a coastal community that has developed dominated by invasive species—the decapod predators Palaemon elegans and Rhithropanopeus harrisii, the amphipod grazer Gammarus tigrinus, and the filter‐feeder Dreissena polymorpha. The orthogonal experiment determined separate and interactive effects from predators on the lower trophic level invasive species and native algae including the foundation species Fucus radicans. The main result was that while both predators significantly impacted the community, in no cases were their effects interactive. Another important result was that P. elegans appeared to cause a trophic cascade, as in its presence F. radicans and its epiphytes had the greatest biomass while G. tigrinus grazers were heavily reduced. G. tigrinus were negatively correlated with F. radicans biomass, so variable amphipod grazing may be the link allowing an indirect effect of P. elegans on F. radicans. R. harrisii also reduced G. tigrinus abundance but did not affect F. radicans biomass. Both predators significantly affected the lengths of F. radicans plant stems that were comprised of new vegetative growth—P. elegans reduced the lengths of new vegetative tissue while R. harrisii increased it. Thus, the presence of P. elegans induced shorter and denser F. radicans bushes compared to taller and thinner bushes observed in other treatments. Lastly, R. harrisii caused significant declines in D. polymorpha numbers. Overall, ecological management needs to consider positive effects from predator invasion which may reduce grazing pressure on low trophic level foundation species. A trophic cascade involving two invasive species highlights the importance of multi‐species approaches to management of Baltic Sea invasive species and in other regions prone to biological invasions.},

	abstract = {Ecosystems across the United States are changing in complex and unpredictable ways and analysis of these changes requires coordinated, long‐term research. This paper is a product of a synthesis effort of the U.S. National Science Foundation funded Long‐Term Ecological Research (LTER) network addressing the LTER core research area of “populations and communities.” This analysis revealed that each LTER site had at least one compelling “story” about what their site would look like in 50–100 yr. As the stories were prepared, themes emerged, and the stories were group into papers along five themes: state change, connectivity, resilience, time lags, and cascading effects. This paper addresses the cascading effects theme and includes stories from the Bonanza Creek (boreal), Kellogg Biological Station (agricultural and freshwater), Palmer (Antarctica), and Harvard Forest (temperate forest) LTER sites. We define cascading effects very broadly to include a wide array of unforeseen chains of events that result from a variety of actions or changes in a system. While climate change is having important direct effects on boreal forests, indirect effects mediated by fire activity—severity, size, and return interval—have large cascading effects over the long term. In northeastern temperate forests, legacies of human management and disturbance affect the composition of current forests, which creates a cascade of effects that interact with the climate‐facilitated invasion of an exotic pest. In Antarctica, declining sea ice creates a cascade of effects including declines in Adèlie and increases in Gentoo penguins, changes in phytoplankton, and consequent changes in zooplankton populations. An invasion of an exotic species of lady beetle is likely to have important future effects on pest control and conservation of native species in agricultural landscapes. New studies of zebra mussels, a well‐studied invader, have established links between climate, the heat tolerance of the mussels, and harmful algal blooms. Collectively, these stories highlight the need for long‐term studies to sort out the complexities of different types of ecological cascades. The diversity of sites within the LTER network facilitates the emergence of overarching concepts about trophic interactions as an important driver of ecosystem structure, function, services, and futures.},

	abstract = {An array of vectors have been identified that pose a risk of spreading invasive alien species (IAS), from personal protective equipment to large equipment such as vehicles and boats. Biosecurity practices that remove and/or kill IAS reduce the risk of accidental spread. The effectiveness of biosecurity protocols suitable for large equipment is little tested and requires development. One widely-used biosecurity method for large equipment is high-pressure hot water spray machines. This study tests the effectiveness of high-pressure hot water spray to induce mortality in two invasive aquatic plants: floating pennywort (Hydrocotyle ranunculoides) and Australian swamp-stonecrop (Crassula helmsii); and two invasive invertebrates: killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus) and zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in field conditions. IAS were exposed to hot water spray for a range of durations (5–15 seconds) and from a range of distances (10–30 cm). Further treatments of up to 90 seconds were applied to C. helmsii. Complete survival of D. polymorpha, D. villosus and C. helmsii was seen in all control treatments following exposure to cold water spray. Hot water spray caused complete mortality of D. polymorpha and D. villosus at 10 cm for 15 seconds, demonstrating the effectiveness of the hot water treatment in inducing mortality. However, treatments were less effective when applied at longer distances and shorter durations. In contrast, hot water spray was ineffective in causing mortality in C. helmsii, even at 90 seconds of exposure. Fragmentation and complete mortality was seen in H. ranunculoides following exposure to hot and cold water spray, therefore the pressure of the spray was associated with H. ranunculoides mortality. The use of hot water spray is effective against the aquatic invasive animals tested here, however to ensure complete mortality, the importance of both duration and distance of hot water spray application is highlighted. Hot water spray did cause complete mortality in H. ranunculoides but not in C. helmsii, therefore the need for treatment water containment and safe disposal is paramount to prevent spread of potentially viable propagules.},

	abstract = {The ability to produce byssal threads enables invasive dreissenid mussels to attach to recreational boat hulls and other equipment. These mussels can be exposed to air during overland transport of recreational boats, which affects their potential to survive transport. Survival during air exposure is determined by a variety of environmental factors such as temperature, relative humidity, shaking and vibrations and the movement of air. This study assessed the influence of air movement on the survival and behavioural changes of the quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis). Survival time decreased significantly when mussels were exposed to a wind speed of 10 and 50 km.h-1 compared to standing air survival. Mussel clumps survived significantly longer than mussel individuals. The lethal time of 99\% of mussel individuals (LT99) decreased from 29.26 to 18.24 hours when exposed to a wind speed of 50 km.h-1. At a wind speed of 10 km.h-1 LT99 survival times of mussel clumps (26.94 h) were higher compared to individual mussels (19.76 h). Valve gaping behaviour changed when mussels were exposed to flowing air. Mussels exposed to a wind speed of 10 km.h-1 were on average open for 6.41\% of the time, whereas in standing air mussels were on average open for 26.78\% of the time. These results indicate that air movement has an influence on the survival potential of aerially exposed quagga mussels. Management of invasive alien mussels should take into account that the quagga mussel can survive air exposure with an wind speed of 50 km.h-1 over 18 hours when attached to boat hulls. 50\% of the mussels can be transported alive for distances over 300 km and 1\% of the mussels can be transported alive for more than 900 km. Decontamination of boats and associated equipment will be vital for improved spread-prevention of invasive mussels.},

	abstract = {Decontaminating recreational watercraft, and fishing, sailing or watersports equipment after use can reduce the overland dispersal of aquatic invasive species (AIS) among lakes. Recommended methods include pressure-washing, rinsing with hot water, using cleaning agents, or air-drying, but the extent of their efficacy is unknown. The aim of this review is to assess the effectiveness of current decontamination measures for recreational watercraft against various AIS. Web of Science, Greenfile, Environment Complete and Geobase were searched for articles published through September 2019. Studies on preventing overland AIS spread, and plant and invertebrate AIS response to hot water, pressure-washing, desiccation or cleaning agents, were selected. Of 37 studies included in the review, the majority (70.3\%) assessed air-drying, followed by hot water (32.4\%), household chemicals (16.2\%), and pressure-washing (2.7\%). The recommended air-drying duration of up to one week produced high mortality (≥ 90\%) among several invertebrate and macrophyte species, although survival was high for certain aquatic snails. Larger and/or older invertebrates were more resistant to desiccation. Aquatic plant survival and growth were inversely related to water loss (a function of drying time and relative humidity), and short or single fragments were less resistant to air-drying than larger or clustered fragments. Immersion in water ≥ 50 °C for 15 minutes resulted in 100\% mortality among mussels, small invertebrates and some plant species. A higher temperature of 60 °C was required for hot water spray applications lasting ≥ 5 seconds to achieve the same mortality rate among dreissenid mussels. High pressure-washing eliminated significantly more entangled plants, and small organisms and seeds than low pressure. Household chemicals such as salt or bleach required specific doses and immersion durations to be lethal to small organisms. This review reveals that current decontamination methods may be effective, but their efficacy against a diversity of AIS, including those on watch lists, are not yet well-understood. As the literature is currently skewed towards studies on air-drying, which has limited efficacy, further research is required to evaluate practical, and alternate or combined measures to best inform management practices.},

Molecular gut content analysis is a popular tool to study food web interactions and was recently also suggested as an alternative source for DNA based biomonitoring. However, the overabundant consumer’s DNA often outcompetes that of its diet during PCR. Blocking approaches are an efficient means to reduce consumer amplification while retaining broad specificity for dietary taxa. We here designed an assay to monitor the eukaryotic diet of mussels and test their utility as biological eDNA filters to monitor planktonic communities. We designed several rDNA primer sets with a broad taxonomic suitability for eukaryotes, which suppress the amplification of mussels. The primers were tested using mussel DNA extracts and the results were compared to eDNA water samples collected next to the mussel colonies. Taxonomic recovery, as well as patterns of alpha and beta diversity, were compared between mussels and water samples. In addition, we analyzed time series samples of mussel samples from different German rivers. Our primer sets efficiently block the amplification of various mussel genera. The recovered DNA reflects a broad dietary preference across the eukaryotic tree of life and considerable taxonomic overlap with filtered water samples. We also recover various taxa of possible commensals and parasites, associated with the mussels. Our protocol will enable large scale dietary analysis in mussels, facilitate aquatic food web analysis, elucidate the ecological impact of invasive bivalves and the rapid survey of mussel aquacultures for pathogens. Moreover, we show that mussels could serve as an interesting complementary DNA source for biomonitoring.

With a relative lack of research efforts in the tropics [49, 50], and the potential variation in identified traits at the local level ([51]; see also S1 Table), it is unclear if risk assessments performed within tropical regions would identify similar patterns or suites of traits as those conducted in other climatic regions.

	abstract = {Laboratory microcosm systems provide researchers with an invaluable tool to rapidly model real-world ecology in a highly-controlled environment. These models have already proved capable of predicting real-world outcomes in relation to a variety of ecological processes, but further microcosm investigations, and comparisons with real-world studies, are required before these systems can be relied upon as rapid diagnostic tools which can inform real-world management decisions. Here, the use of microcosm systems to model ecological processes involved in biological invasion events is discussed, and three experiments relating to these processes are described.1)	Preadaptation of Pseudomonas fluorescens to the biotic and abiotic environmental conditions in a soil microcosm was found to drive diversity within the P. fluorescens population, including genetic, morphological, and metabolic diversity. When inoculated into soil microcosms alongside a resident soil community, this diversity within this focal population drives greater changes in the community structure of the resident soil community compared with ancestral P. fluorescens SBW25. Interestingly, diversity of the focal population was found to be the single most important driver of changes in resident community structure, over the effects of fitness and of direct adaptations to the environment itself.2)	Preadaptation to disturbance-related mortality events may provide species with a competitive advantage during and after such events. Here, P. fluorescens populations preadapted to a range of disturbance regimes were subjected to competitive fitness assays in KB broth under both the regimes they were preadapted to, and the full range of regimes investigated. At 99\% mortality of resident populations, disturbance frequency was found to have a non-significant correlation with the morphological diversity of populations recovered at the end of the experimental period. As previous work has found significant effects of disturbance upon P. fluorescens morphological diversity using a similar system, at 99.9\% mortality, this study indicates that further work with this system may yield results of interest either using higher intensities or higher frequencies of disturbance than were investigated here.3)	Using whole natural microbial communities to study ecological processes within a microcosm system provides rapid results comparable to the complexities of real-world ecological systems, however, current understanding of the complex relationships of diverse microbial communities with the biotic and abiotic components of their environment are not currently fully understood. In order to truly understand the changes in resident community structure when conducting microcosm studies, a good understanding of the niche-space used by each member of the community is desirable. Here, a series of simple experiments yielded a small community of 5 microbial species that could be distinguished by eye beyond the end of a 6-week co-existence study. This lays the foundations for building an artificial community that can be easily characterised and manipulated when investigating ecological processes in microcosm systems, and provide data on changes in community structure without the need for complex or expensive equipment and techniques.},

Réagir aux menaces des espėces envahissantes afin de minimiser leurs incidences sur les écosystémes, les collectivités, la sécurité alimentaire et les économies nordiques nécessitera des activités d'observation et de surveillance d'envergure. Toutefois, les gestionnaires de ressources sont souvent tenus de prendre des décisions sans posséder de données et de ressources adéquates. Les programmes d'observation locaux, comme les programmes de science citoyenne et les programmes de surveillance communautaire, constituent des méthodes intéressantes d'augmentation de la capacité d'observation qui comportent des approches contributives et créées en collaboration tout en ayant pour effet de sensibiliser les parties prenantes aux enjeux. Bien que le modéle créé en collaboration ait été appliqué et encouragé å grande échelle dans le contexte de l'Arctique, les programmes de science citoyenne contributive offrent un outil supplémentaire pour s'attaquer aux besoins d'observation dans l'Arctique.

The Arctic is in a unique position to prevent new introductions and spread of existing invasive species by adopting policies and actions aimed at early detection. Responding to threats from invasive species to minimize impacts to ecosystems, communities, food security, and northern economies will necessitate extensive observations and monitoring, but resource managers often face decisions without having adequate data and resources at hand. Local observing programs such as citizen science and community-based monitoring programs present attractive methods for increasing observing capacity that span contributory and co-created approaches while raising awareness of an issue among stakeholders. While the co-created model has been widely applied and encouraged in the Arctic context, contributory citizen science programs offer an additional tool for addressing observing needs in the Arctic. We showcase three contributory citizen science programs related to freshwater, terrestrial, and marine environments that have supported the objectives of the Alaska Invasive Species Partnership. We discuss criteria for achieving ARIAS priority actions at the participant scale related to participants' motivation and participants' understanding of the value of their contributions, at the programmatic scale, for example promoting accessible, reciprocal, and transparent knowledge exchange, and at the policy and science scale where management action is data driven. The approach is aimed at successful integration of citizen science into Arctic policy making. Finally, we discuss challenges related to broader global data collection and future directions for contributory citizen science within Arctic observing networks.},

Attachment to various surfaces allows these invasive mussels to rapidly spread, however the adhesion mechanism is not fully understood. While marine mussel adhesion mechanics has been studied at the individual byssal-strand level, freshwater mussel adhesion has only been characterized through whole-mussel detachment, without direct interspecies comparisons on different substrates. Here, adhesive strength of individual quagga and zebra mussel byssal plaques were measured on smooth substrates with varying hydrophobicity—glass, PVC, and PDMS. With increased hydrophobicity of substrates, adhesive failures occurred more frequently, and mussel adhesion strength decreased. A new failure mode termed 'footprint failure' was identified, where failure appeared to be adhesive macroscopically, but a microscopic residue remained on the surface. Zebra mussels adhered stronger and more frequently on PDMS than quagga mussels. While their adhesion strengths were similar on PVC, there were differences in the failure mode and the plaque-substrate interface ultrastructure. Comparisons with previous marine mussel studies demonstrated that freshwater mussels adhere with comparable strength despite known differences in protein composition. An improved understanding of freshwater mussel adhesion mechanics may help explain spreading dynamics and will be important in developing effective antifouling surfaces.},

Data were collected using the databases provided by two regional environmental agencies in northern Italy (Lombardy and Piedmont regions) and by the governmental monitoring program of Switzerland, which were integrated with a systematic literature search on Google scholar and ISI Web of Science. In the assessment area, 16 macroinvertebrate invasive alien species were reported: nine mollusks, four decapods, and three amphipods. The species assessment indicated seven species with a high level of invasiveness: Procambarus clarkii, Faxonius limosus (formerly, Orconectes limosus) and Pacifastacus leniusculus, Dreissena polymorpha, Corbicula fluminea, Sinanodonta woodiana, and Pseudosuccinea columella. The results allow invasive species managers to understand which species to focus their monitoring on in the near future in order to track IAS movements and limit their spread within the hydrographic system and to provide the identification and refinement of concerted bilateral strategies aimed at limiting the impacts of these species. They also account for the implications of future climate change on the invasion potential of each species.},

	abstract = {Freshwater mussels are an imperiled group of organisms that are vital to aquatic ecosystems. Services performed by freshwater mussels, coupled with their use for biomonitoring, make them an invaluable asset. Neogobius melanostomus (Round Goby), a recently introduced invasive species to the French Creek watershed, was once restricted to the watershed of Lake Erie in Pennsylvania. The Round Goby’s propensity to consume Dreissena polymorpha (Zebra Mussel) and Dreissena bugensis (Quagga Mussel) in their native habitat raises concerns about this recent introduction into Pennsylvania’s Allegheny River watershed. Since the discovery of their introduction within the watershed, we have followed the range expansion and dispersal rate of Round Gobies, which makes this study unique. The objectives of this study were to quantify baseline data on the contemporary diversity and abundance of unionid mussels in the upper French Creek watershed, and to explore potential habitat factors that influence or limit the size of the mussel populations. We gathered baseline data on freshwater mussel diversity and abundances across eight sites in the French Creek watershed and examined substrate particle size and host availability as potential limiting factors of the freshwater mussel distribution. Freshwater mussel surveys were conducted during the summer months (July–September) of 2017 using area-constrained surveys. Results showed a significant relationship between mussel diversity and substrate particle size (p {\textless} 0.05). From the data collected, we were able to calculate population estimates for the species found across the sample sites. Our results regarding the locations of native mussel populations and characteristics of their habitat provide the needed insight for establishing priority areas for the conservation of freshwater mussels, facilitating planning for protection, mitigation, and adaptation as the invasive Round Goby continues its spread.},

	abstract = {Stimulated by excess levels of phosphorus, the attached, filamentous green alga Cladophora grows to nuisance proportions in Lake Michigan, one of the Laurentian Great Lakes. While nearshore waters impacted by local sources of the nutrient continue to support nuisance conditions, offshore waters have undergone oligotrophication in response to reductions in phosphorus loading and benthification of phosphorus cycling by invasive dreissenid mussels. A concept termed the Dual Challenge recognizes that implementation of more stringent phosphorus-loading objectives (to control Cladophora in the nearshore) stands in conflict with a foreseen need to mitigate oligotrophication in the offshore (to sustain a healthy fishery). Attention to this nearshore–offshore dynamic calls into play the role of cross-margin phosphorus transport in mediating both endmembers of the conflict. We applied a biophysical model simulating soluble reactive (SRP) and particulate (PP) phosphorus, mussel biokinetics, and cross-margin mass transport in addressing the Dual Challenge. Pre- and post-dreissenid monitoring results suggest that a reduction in offshore PP levels (food web nutrition) in excess of 40\% (2.4 to 1.4 mgP·m−3) has driven oligotrophication and attendant food web dysfunction. Yet, in the absence of local sources, model-predicted nearshore SRP levels remain at or below those required to prevent nuisance growth. These findings indicate that there is a margin of {\textasciitilde}1 mgP·m−3 over which offshore PP levels could be increased (to the benefit of the food web and the fishery) without hindering efforts to reduce nuisance algal growth through local source control.},

Specimens of Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) were exposed for 48 h and 7 days to a wide range of ZnCl2 nominal concentrations (1–10–50–100 mg/L), including those environmentally relevant. Cellulose-based nanosponges (CNS) were also tested to assess their safety and suitability for Zn removal from freshwater. Zebra mussels were exposed to 50 mg/L ZnCl2 alone or incubated with 1.25 g/L of CNS (2 h) and then removed by filtration. The effect of Zn decontamination induced by CNS has been verified by the acute toxicity bioassay Microtox®. DNA primary damage was investigated by the Comet assay; micronuclei frequency and nuclear morphological alterations were assessed by Cytome assay in mussels’ haemocytes. The results confirmed the genotoxic effect of ZnCl2 in zebra mussel haemocytes at 48 h and 7-day exposure time. Zinc concentrations were measured in CNS, suggesting that cellulose-based nanosponges were able to remove Zn(II) by reducing its levels in exposure waters and soft tissues of D. polymorpha in agreement with the observed restoration of genetic damage exerted by zinc exposure alone.},

	abstract = {Instream barriers can constrain dispersal of nonnative fishes, creating opportunities to test their impact on native communities above and below these barriers. Deposition of sediments in a river inflow to Lake Powell, USA resulted in creation of a large waterfall prohibiting upstream movement of fishes from the reservoir allowing us to evaluate the trophic niche of fishes above and below this barrier. We expected niche overlap among native and nonnative species would increase in local assemblages downstream of the barrier where nonnative fish diversity and abundance were higher. Fishes upstream of the barrier had more distinct isotopic niches and species exhibited a wider range in δ15N relative to downstream. In the reservoir, species were more constrained in δ15N and differed more in δ13C, representing a shorter, wider food web. Differences in energetic pathways and resource availability among habitats likely contributed to differences in isotopic niches. Endangered Razorback Sucker (Xyrauchen texanus) aggregate at some reservoir inflows in the Colorado River basin, and this is where we found the highest niche overlap among species. Whether isotopic niche overlap among adult native and nonnative species has negative consequences is unclear, because data on resource availability and use are lacking; however, these observations do indicate the potential for competition. Still, the impacts of diet overlap among trophic generalists, such as Razorback Sucker, are likely low, particularly in habitats with diverse and abundant food bases such as river-reservoir inflows.},

Traditional detection methods have limitations, and PCR based environmental DNA detection has provided interesting results for early warning. However, in the last years, the development of isothermal amplification methods has received increasing attention. Among them, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has several advantages, including its higher tolerance to the presence of inhibitors and the possibility of naked-eye detection, which enables and simplifies its potential use in decentralized settings. In the current study, a real-time LAMP (qLAMP) method for the detection of Dreissena polymorpha was developed and tested with samples from the Guadalquivir River basin, together with two real-time PCR (qPCR) methods using different detection chemistries, targeting a specific region of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome C oxidase subunit I. All three developed approaches were evaluated regarding specificity, sensitivity and time required for detection. Regarding sensitivity, both qPCR approaches were more sensitive than qLAMP by one order of magnitude, however the qLAMP method proved to be as specific and much faster being performed in just 9 min versus 23 and 29 min for the qPCR methods based on hydrolysis probe and intercalating dye respectively.},

We evaluated the use of the invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) as a potential bioindicator of microplastic litter in freshwater lakes. Samples were collected from three sites (Lovere, Costa Volpino, Castro) at the northern end of Lake Iseo (one of the major subalpine lakes in north Italy) and compared for water physicochemical parameters, biometrical features of zebra mussels, and microplastics items/specimens (color, shape, size, and chemical composition). We hypothesized that since a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) on the Oglio River discharges into this area of the lake, the microplastics in D.polymorpha could be measured and compared in samples from the three sites at different distances from the WWTP. There was no difference in the physicochemical water parameters and biometric features between the samples from the three sites, whereas there was a significant difference in items/specimen between the sites in decreasing order (mean ± standard deviation): Costa Volpino (0.23 ± 0.43) {\textgreater} Lovere (0.07 ± 0.25) {\textgreater} Castro (0.03 ± 0.18). The chi-square test showed a significant difference in shape, color, and chemical composition frequency in the samples from the three sites. The chemical composition of the microplastics was polyethylene terephthalate (45\%), nylon (20\%), polypropylene (20\%), polyamide resin (10\%), and polyvinyl chloride (5\%). Our data show that the amount of microplastics the zebra mussel accumulated was greater the closer the sampling site to the WWTP. Our findings suggest that the zebra mussel may provide a useful tool to monitor microplastics pollution in lakes.},

Established monitoring methods require the collection or observation of specimens, which is unlikely at the beginning of an invasion when densities are likely to be low. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a highly promising technique for the detection of INNS—particularly during the early stages of an invasion.Here, we compared the use of traditional kick‐net sampling with two eDNA approaches (targeted detection using both conventional and quantitative PCR and passive detection via metabarcoding with conserved primers) for detection of quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, a high priority INNS, along a density gradient on the River Wraysbury, UK.All three molecular tools outperformed traditional sampling in terms of detection. Conventional PCR and qPCR both had 100\% detection rate in all samples and outperformed metabarcoding when the target species was at low densities. Additionally, quagga mussel DNA copy number (qPCR) and relative read count (metabarcoding) were significantly influenced by both mussel density and distance from source population, with distance being the most significant predictor.Synthesis and application. All three molecular approaches were more sensitive than traditional kick‐net sampling for the detection of the quagga mussel in flowing water, and both qPCR and metabarcoding enabled estimates of relative abundance. Targeted approaches were more sensitive than metabarcoding, but metabarcoding has the advantage of providing information on the wider community and consequently the impacts of INNS.},

	abstract = {The effects of an invasive species on the environment can be altered by anthropogenic activities such as nutrient pollution or the presence of additional invasive species with similar or unique traits. Using experimental mesocosms, we tested the separate and combined effects of three invasive mollusks (zebra mussels, Asian clams, and banded mystery snails) on freshwater environments in nutrient‐poor and nutrient‐enriched conditions. We predicted that in nutrient‐poor conditions, single mollusk species would reduce the abundance of algae and zooplankton, but nutrient enrichment would mitigate these effects. Regardless of nutrient additions, paired bivalve species would reduce phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance, increasing periphyton biomass. Bivalves and snails paired together would reduce periphyton, phytoplankton, and zooplankton compared to communities with paired bivalve species. Finally, nutrient enrichment would increase the survival or biomass of paired bivalves and snails. Single, paired, and three co‐occurring invasive mollusks did not affect algae or zooplankton abundance. Banded mystery snails reduced nutrient concentrations in high‐nutrient conditions more than other invasive species, but the reduced nutrients did not affect algal abundance. Paired invasive species did not affect the survival or biomass of other invasive species. Nutrient enrichment increased the biomass of zebra mussels and mystery snails, but not Asian clams. Additionally, zebra mussel reproduction increased in the high‐nutrient treatment when banded mystery snails were present, but not when all three species were together. We conclude that human‐induced trophic states might determine the effects that single and multiple invasive species have in freshwater environments.},

	abstract = {Species compositions and diversity levels of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities provide important indicators of ecosystem health. However, such community analyses typically are limited by time and effort of sampling, sorting, and identifications, as well as morphological character uncertainty for some taxa, especially at early life stages. Our objective was to evaluate a suite of targeted metabarcode high‐throughput sequencing assays to characterize the macroinvertebrate communities (specifically targeting Annelida, Bryozoa, Crustacea, Insecta, and Mollusca) from environmental (e)DNA water samples along 160 km of the Maumee River, OH (a major Lake Erie, Laurentian Great Lakes tributary). Multiple alpha (richness, Shannon Index, and Simpson's Index) and beta (Bray–Curtis and Sørensen dissimilarities) diversity metrics from the metabarcode assays were compared with an Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) metric calculated from traditional morphological sampling surveys conducted by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. The 15 Maumee River sites varied in their ICI scores (ranging from 4 to 46), with seven sites rated as “poor” or “very poor” and eight scoring “fair” or “good.” Metabarcoding assays yielded greater gamma richness, delineating 181 Operational Taxonomic Units versus 172 taxa from morphology (the latter often limited to family or genus‐level identifications). Both datasets supported similar river‐wide trends, with comparable gamma, alpha, and beta diversity patterns and community compositions across habitat types and habitat quality scores. Metabarcode assays revealed similar detection of important bioindicator Insecta, but missed most Trichoptera (caddisflies). eDNA identified eight aquatic invasive species on the GLANSIS (Great Lakes Aquatic Nonindigenous Species Information System) list, including three missed by the morphological surveys (Branchiura sowerbyi, Potamothrix bedoti, and Skistodiaptomus pallidus; with Lophopodella carteri, Faxonius rusticus, Corbicula fluminea, Dreissena polymorpha, and Valvata piscinalis in both datasets). Findings illustrate the utility of eDNA sampling and targeted metabarcode assays to enhance and complement environmental assessments of aquatic ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Resource managers may be hesitant to make decisions based on environmental (e)DNA results alone since eDNA is an indirect method of species detection. One way to reduce the uncertainty of eDNA is to identify laboratory‐based protocols that ensure repeatable and reproducible results. We conducted a double‐blind round‐robin analysis of probe‐based assays for DNA of dreissenid (Dreissena spp.) mussels, which are prolific aquatic invaders that can cause significant economic and ecological impacts. DNA extract from water samples spiked with known amounts of dreissenid DNA and from water samples collected from waters with and without dreissenids were analyzed by four independent research laboratories. We used results to calculate detection repeatability within laboratories and assays, detection reproducibility among laboratories and assays, and estimated dreissenid DNA copy number precision and accuracy. Laboratory and assay repeatability and reproducibility of detection results were high, 91\% and 92\%, respectively. The estimated copy numbers were neither precise nor accurate for samples spiked with {\textless}773 gene copies. These results suggest that eDNA surveillance of dreissenid mussels, using the protocols evaluated herein, can generate reliable detection data for decision‐making. However, managers should be cautious about using the quantitative information often associated with eDNA detections, especially when DNA is at lower abundance. Our results provide strong support that eDNA has the potential to provide repeatable and reproducible evidence under varying laboratory conditions and for different sample water chemistries. This is reassuring since the demand for eDNA surveillance is widespread and number of laboratories that process eDNA samples is growing steadily.},

The area has been monitored using suspended ropes since 2016, and during October 2019, mussels of 5–43.8 mm shell length were recorded for the first time in the Alfundão reservoir. The shallow lined reservoir was then chlorinated and drained. To date, this treatment appears to have been successful in eliminating this population.

	abstract = {As aquatic invasive species (AIS) proliferate worldwide, a better understanding of their roles in invaded habitats is needed to inform management and introduction prevention strategies and priorities. Metabarcoding of stomach content DNA (scDNA) shows considerable promise in such regard. We thus metabarcoded scDNA from two non-native fish species (alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax)), and three native ones (bloater (Coregonus hoyi), ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus)). Fishes (N = 376) were sampled in spring 2009 and 2010 from 73–128 m depths at three Lake Michigan sites. Four mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase 1 (CO1) primer sets designed to target five potential AIS prey, and a universal aquatic invertebrate CO1 primer set targeting both native and AIS prey were used. Quality controlled prey amplicons were matched to three AIS prey: Bythotrephes longimanus (mean percent frequency occurrence, all samples = 7\%), Cercopagis pengoi (5\%), and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (11\%). Neither invasive prey Dreissena polymorpha nor Hemimysis anomala were detected. Native prey Leptodiaptomus sicilis, Limnocalanus macrurus, and Mysis diluviana were relatively common in scDNA (respective mean percent occurrences, all samples: 48\%, 25\%, 42\%). Analysis of variation in prey occurrences for sample site, predator species, sample year, sample depth, and predator total length (TL) indicated site and predator species were most important. However, B. longimanus occurrence in scDNA depended upon predator TL, perhaps indicative of its unique defensive spine limiting susceptibility to predation until fishes exceed species-specific gape-based limitations. Our analysis of native and invasive prey species indicated possible indirect AIS impacts such as native predators switching their diet due to AIS-driven losses of preferred native prey. Metabarcoding demonstrated that AIS are integrated components of the offshore Lake Michigan food web, with both native and non-native predators, and both invasive and native prey are affecting species interactions across multiple trophic levels.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0235387},
	abstract = {Two invasive mussels (zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha and quagga mussel D. rostriformis bugensis) have restructured the benthic habitat of many water bodies in both Europe and North America. Quagga mussels dominate in most lakes where they co-occur even though zebra mussels typically invade lakes first. A reversal to zebra mussel over time has rarely been observed. Laboratory experiments have shown that quagga mussels grow faster than zebra mussels when predator kairomones are present and this faster growth is associated with lower investment in anti-predator response in quagga mussels than zebra mussels. This led to the hypothesis that the dominance of quagga mussels is due to faster growth that is not offset by higher vulnerability to predators when predation rates are low, as may be expected in newly colonized lakes. It follows that in lakes with high predation pressure, the anti-predatory investments of zebra mussels should be more advantageous and zebra mussels should be the more abundant of the two species. In Onondaga Lake, NY, a meso-eutrophic lake with annual mussel surveys from 2005 to 2018, quagga mussels increased from less than 6\% of the combined mussel biomass in 2007 to 82\% in 2009 (from 3 to 69\% by number), rates typical of this displacement process elsewhere, but then declined again to 11–20\% of the mussel biomass in 2016–2018. Average total mussel biomass also declined from 344–524 g shell-on dry weight (SODW)/m2 in 2009–2011 to 34–73 g SODW/m2 in 2016–2018, mainly due to fewer quagga mussels. This decline in total mussel biomass and a return to zebra mussel as the most abundant species occurred as the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) increased in abundance. Both the increase to dominance of quagga mussels and the subsequent decline following the increase in this molluscivorous fish are consistent with the differences in the trade-off between investment in growth and investment in defenses of the two species. We predict that similar changes in dreissenid mussel populations will occur in other lakes following round goby invasions, at least on the habitats colonized by both species.},

	abstract = {Freshwater mussels are in decline worldwide, with the depressed river mussel Pseudanodonta complanata being one of the rarest and most endangered species in Europe. Invasive mussels are suspected to be an important factor of decline, but there is little information on their interaction with native species.This study analyzed densities, depth distribution, and individual sizes and weights in one of the largest known populations of P. complanata in Europe in relation to the co‐occurring invasive zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and other mussel species, using a systematic transect analysis.Pseudanodonta complanata was the dominant unionid species in Lake Siecino reaching densities of up to 26 ind/m2, with half of the specimens found at a water depth of 2.0–4.0 m. Densities were highest on sandy substrates in areas of underwater currents. In contrast, 67\% of native Unio tumidus were found at depths {\textless} 1 m, indicating different habitat preference.In the study area, 91\% of P. complanata, 92\% of U. tumidus, and all Anodonta individuals were fouled by D. polymorpha. The dreissenid:unionid mass ratio (mean ± SD; maximum) was 0.43 ± 0.56; 4.22 and 0.86 ± 1.87; 8.76 in P. complanata and U. tumidus, respectively. Pseudanodonta complanata fouled with D. polymorpha were impaired in their anchoring capability and had shell deformations potentially affecting shell closing and filtration activity. Fouling intensity was negatively correlated with unionid density, potentially leading to accelerated population declines.The observed adverse effects of invasive zebra mussels on the depressed river mussel and the difficulties in eradicating established populations of invasive mussels suggest that D. polymorpha should be considered a serious threat to P. complanata. Therefore, the further spread of zebra mussels into habitats with native unionids needs to be avoided by all means.},

Under laboratory experimental conditions, mussels ingest and retain fluorescent polystyrene (PS) beads with carboxylic acid (COOH) termination over a size range of 200–2000 nm. The number of beads the mussels ingested is quantified using fluorescence spectroscopy and the location of the beads in the mussels is imaged using fluorescence microscopy. PS beads of similar size (1000–2000 nm) to mussels' preferred food are trafficked in the ciliated food grooves of the gills. Beads of all sizes are observed in the mussels' digestive tracts, indicating that the mussels do not efficiently reject the beads as unwanted foreign material, regardless of size. Fluorescence microscopy shows all sizes of beads are concentrated in the siphons and are retained there for longer than one month postexposure. Combined atomic force microscopy–infrared spectroscopy and photothermal infrared spectroscopy are used to locate, image, and chemically identify the beads in the mussel siphons. In sum, these experiments demonstrate the potential for using mussels, specifically their siphons, to monitor environmental accumulation of aquatic nanoplastics.},

The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a monitoring tool in freshwater systems is becoming increasingly acceptable and widely used for the detection of single species. Here we demonstrate the development and application of standard PCR primers for the detection of two freshwater invasive species which are high priority for monitoring in the UK and elsewhere: the Dreissenid mussels; Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1987) and D. polymorpha (Pallas, 1771). We carried out a rigorous validation process for testing the new primers, including DNA detection and degradation experiments in mesocosms, and a field comparison with traditional monitoring protocols. eDNA from single individuals of both mussel species could be detected within four hours of the start of the mesocosm experiment. In field trials, the two mussel species were detected at all sites where the species are known to be present, and eDNA consistently outperformed traditional kick-net sampling for species detection. These results demonstrate the applicability of standard PCR for eDNA detection of freshwater invasive species.},

	abstract = {Ireland, being an island situated on Europe’s western seaboard, has a fewer number of native species than mainland European Union Member States (MS). Increased numbers of vectors and pathways have reduced the island’s biotic isolation, increasing the risk of new introductions and their associated impacts on native biodiversity. It is likely that these risks are greater here than they are in continental Member States, where the native biodiversity is richer. A horizon scanning approach was used to identify the most likely IAS (with the potential to impact biodiversity) to arrive on the island of Ireland within the next ten years. To achieve this, we used a consensus-based approach, whereby expert opinion and discussion groups were utilised to establish and rank a list of 40 species of the most likely terrestrial, freshwater and marine IAS to arrive on the island of Ireland within the decade 2017–2027. The list of 40 included 18 freshwater invaders, 15 terrestrial IAS and seven marine species. Crustacean species (freshwater and marine) were taxonomically dominant (11 out of 40); this reflects their multiple pathways of introduction, their ability to act as ecosystem engineers and their resulting high impacts on biodiversity. Freshwater species dominated the top ten IAS (seven species out of ten), with the signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) highlighted as the most likely species to arrive and establish in freshwaters, while roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) (second) and the warm-water barnacle (Hesperibalanus fallax) (fifth), were the most likely terrestrial and marine invaders. This evidence-based list provides important information to the relevant statutory agencies in both jurisdictions in Ireland to prioritise the prevention of the most likely invaders and aid in compliance with legislation, in particular the EU Regulation on Invasive Alien Species (EU 1143/2014). Targeted biosecurity in both jurisdictions is urgently required in order to manage the pathways and vectors of arrival, and is vital to maintaining native biodiversity on the island of Ireland.},

With observations spanning more than 20 yr, we here examine biogeographic trends among zooplankton communities, patterns of biological invasion across the region, and environmental correlates with dominant native and invasive taxa. Our results show that some estuaries across the region are invaded by multiple zooplankton species and that the geographic extent of invasion is far greater than previously reported for at least five species of copepods: Pseudodiaptomus inopinus, Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Oithona davisae, Limnoithona sinensis, Sinocalanus doerrii, and the cladoceran Bosmina coregoni. Some of these species appear to be rapidly spreading across the region, while others have occupied a relatively static geographic range for decades. The copepod, P. inopinus, is by far the most abundant and geographically widespread of these invaders, comprising more than 90\% of all zooplankton abundance at some sites. We propose that the geographic distribution of these invaders is strongly constrained by geomorphic characteristics that define the salinity and mixing regimes in these estuaries, reflecting the strong role that physical forces play in structuring estuarine zooplankton communities.},

	abstract = {Eurasian zebra and quagga mussels were likely introduced to the Laurentian Great Lakes via ballast water release in the 1980s, and their range has since expanded across the US, including some of their southernmost occurrences in Texas. Their spread into the state has resulted in a need to revise previous delimitations of suitable dreissenid habitat. We therefore assessed invasion risk in Texas by 1) predicting distribution of suitable habitat of zebra and quagga mussels using Maxent species distribution models based upon global occurrence and climate data; and 2) refining lake-specific predictions via collection and analysis of physicochemical data. Maxent models predicted a lack of suitable habitat for quagga mussels within Texas. However, models did predict the presence of suitable zebra mussel habitat, with hotspots of suitable habitat occurring along the Red and Sabine Rivers of north and east Texas, as well as patches of suitable habitat in central Texas between the Colorado and Brazos Rivers and extending inland along the Gulf Coast. Although predicted suitable habitat extended further west than in previous models, most of the Texas panhandle, west Texas extending toward El Paso, and the Rio Grande valley were predicted to provide poor zebra mussel habitat suitability. Collection of physicochemical data (i.e., dissolved oxygen, pH, specific conductance, and temperature on-site as well as laboratory analysis for Ca, N, and P) from zebra mussel-invaded lakes and a subset of uninvaded but high-risk lakes of North and Central Texas, did not refine model predictions because there was no apparent distinction between invaded and uninvaded lakes. Overall, we demonstrated that while quagga mussels do not appear to represent an invasive threat in Texas, abundant suitable habitat for continuing zebra mussel invasion exists within the state. The threat of continued expansion of this poster-child for negative invasive species impacts warrants further prevention efforts, management, and research.},

	abstract = {The early detection of invasive non-native species (INNS) is important to allow for informed management actions. Established monitoring methods require the collection or observation of specimens, which is unlikely at the beginning of an invasion when densities are likely to be low. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a highly promising technique for the detection of INNS: particularly during the early stages of an invasion. Here, we compared the use of traditional kick-net sampling with two eDNA approaches (targeted detection using both conventional and quantitative PCR, and passive detection via metabarcoding) for detection of quagga mussel, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis; a high priority INNS, along a density gradient on the River Wraysbury, UK. All three molecular tools outperformed traditional sampling in terms of detection. Conventional PCR and qPCR both had 100\% detection rate in all samples, and outperformed metabarcoding when the target species was at low densities. Additionally, quagga mussel DNA copy number (qPCR) and read count (metabarcoding) had a significant negative relationship with distance from source population. Synthesis and application: All three molecular approaches were more sensitive than traditional kick-net sampling for the detection of the quagga mussel in flowing water, and both qPCR and metabarcoding enabled estimates of relative abundance. Targeted approaches were more sensitive than metabarcoding, but metabarcoding has the advantage of providing information on the wider community, and consequently impacts of INNS.},

Cadmium is classified as carcinogen to humans and its mechanism of carcinogenicity includes genotoxic events. In this study a recently developed eco-friendly cellulose-based nanosponge (CNS) was investigated as a candidate in freshwater nano-remediation process. For this purpose, CdCl2 (0.05 mg L−1) contaminated artificial freshwater (AFW) was treated with CNS (1.25 g L−1 for 2 h), and cellular responses were analyzed before and after CNS treatment in Dreissena polymorpha hemocytes. A control group (AFW) and a negative control group (CNS in AFW) were also tested. DNA primary damage was evaluated by Comet assay while chromosomal damage and cell proliferation were assessed by Cytome assay. AFW exposed to CNS did not cause any genotoxic effect in zebra mussel hemocytes. Moreover, DNA damage and cell proliferation induced by Cd(II) turned down to control level after 2 days when CNS were used. A reduction of Cd(II)-induced micronuclei and nuclear abnormalities was also observed. CNS was thus found to be a safe and effective candidate in cadmium remediation process being efficient in metal sequestering, restoring cellular damage exerted by Cd(II) exposure, without altering cellular physiological activity.},

This can in turn influence interactions between and among species, as well as their distribution. This study evaluates how fragmentation of a wetland, the Seal Beach National Wildlife Refuge, influences connectivity by investigating the distribution, habitat use and niche space of native longjaw mudsucker (Gillichthys mirabilis) and nonnative yellowfin goby (Acanthogobius flavimanus). Seasonal beach seines indicated that yellowfin gobies mainly used the culvert habitat while longjaw mudsuckers mainly used the creek habitats; however, they can co-occur in the culvert and larger natural marsh habitat. Due to the differing temperature ranges between habitat types, a laboratory-based respirometry experiment assessed the metabolic rate (MO2) of each species across three temperatures in order to determine temperature sensitivity (Q10) of each species. Diet was investigated through gut content and stable isotope analyses to obtain short and long-term dietary patterns and to help understand each species’ realized niches. Abundance and diet data indicated that yellowfin gobies were associated with deeper habitat, while longjaw mudsuckers were associated with shallower habitat with greater marsh access. Overall, the results indicated that modification of wetland habitats impacts continuity of food sources and physical parameters across habitat types, which influence overall connectivity and fish distribution.},

	abstract = {This thesis brings together information from three different techniques to provide novel information on the ecology of range-shifting gilthead seabream Sparus aurata in the Northeast Atlantic. My chapters take a systematic look at the ecology of S. aurata around the UK, to help explain the drivers that are facilitating the northwards range-shift. First, I use species distribution modelling to investigate the relative importance of temperature on the current distribution of S. aurata, and how it is likely to affect the species range in the future. I find that northern populations of S. aurata appear to be occupying a very different thermal niche to those in the native range, indicating that either a niche shift has occurred, or that northern populations consist primarily of non-reproducing adults. Although this distinction has important implications for successful management of the species, I also find that climate change is likely to result in a further northward shift by 2050. This climate-driven shift is likely to facilitate reproducing populations in the English Channel and the Celtic Sea, assuming that suitable nursery areas are available. Second, I use otolith microchemistry to identify whether multiple sources are contributing to S. aurata populations in the English Channel. Using a multi-element approach, I find evidence for three sources contributing to S. aurata populations in the Channel that have shared otolith chemistry, and that these are temporally stable. These sources could relate to environments that are either spatially or temporally-discrete. I also find that, although there appears to be some mixing after spawning, the three different sources do not contribute equally to populations in the Channel. This mixing could occur during larval dispersal or subsequent adult movement. The multi-element approach allows speculation as to where these sources could be and provides a basis for future research into identifying specific spawning locations. Finally, I use stable isotopes to investigate the potential consequences of increasing S. aurata populations on European seabass Dicentrarchus labrax, by examining the potential for resource competition between juveniles. I find that although both species appear to be feeding on similar prey, they also appear to have different realised niches within the study system. This apparent resource partitioning could indicate a negative competitive effect or a positive indirect effect through indirect mutualism. To my knowledge, this is the first in-depth study of S. aurata in UK waters. Therefore, this thesis provides useful information that can help inform future management measures and conservation of this target species.},

A nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomic approach was developed on this species. The investigation of its informative potential required the prior interpretation of a reference 1H NMR spectrum of a lipid-free zebra mussel extract. After the extraction of polar metabolites from a pool of whole-body D. polymorpha powder, the resulting highly complex 1D 1H NMR spectrum was interpreted and annotated through the analysis of the corresponding 2D homonuclear and heteronuclear NMR spectra. The spectrum interpretation was completed and validated by means of sample spiking with 24 commercial compounds. Among the 238 detected 1H signals, 53\% were assigned, resulting in the identification of 37 metabolites with certainty or high confidence, while 5 metabolites were only putatively identified. The description of such a reference spectrum and its annotation are expected to speed up future analyses and interpretations of NMR-based metabolomic studies on D. polymorpha and to facilitate further explorations of the impact of environmental changes on its physiological state, more particularly in the context of large-scale ecological and ecotoxicological studies.},

Less well known is the role non-native species play in altering biogeochemical processes, such as the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In this study we used laboratory incubations to compare seasonal (spring, summer, fall) emissions of the GHGs nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) from native (Crassostrea virginica) and non-native (Ostrea edulis) oysters collected from a northern temperate estuary (Duxbury Bay, Massachusetts, USA). We observed strong seasonal signals in GHG fluxes, where C. virginica was the higher GHG emitter, and produced on average twice as much N2O (0.39 nmol g-1 dry tissue weight hr-1) and twenty times as much CH4 (1.31 nmol g DTW-1 hr-1) compared to O. edulis (0.16 nmol N2O g DTW-1 hr-1 and 0.07 nmol CH4 g DTW-1 hr-1). C. virginica also had significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) higher summer maximum production rates of CO2 compared to O. edulis (53.4 mol g DTW-1 hr-1 and 45.4 mol g DTW-1 hr-1, respectively). Despite these differences, chlorophyll-a consumption rates between the species were similar (p = 0.95). These results suggest that the non-native O. edulis is a lower GHG emitter than the native C. virginica and highlight that, at least in terms of GHG emissions, this non-native species introduction may not be detrimental to the environment.},

	abstract = {Invasion facilitation, whereby one species has a positive effect on the establishment of another species, could help explain the rapid colonisation shown by some freshwater invasive species, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We employed two-choice test arenas to test whether the presence of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) could facilitate the establishment of the killer shrimp (Dikerogammarus villosus). Killer shrimp preferred to settle on mats of zebra mussel, but this was unrelated to mat size, and was not different from attraction shown to artificial grass, suggesting that zebra mussel primarily provides substrate and refuge to the killer shrimp. Killer shrimp were strongly attracted to water scented by zebra mussel, but not to water scented by fish. Chemical attraction to the zebra mussel’s scent did not differ between sympatric and allopatric populations of killer shrimp, suggesting that chemical attraction is not an acquired or learned trait. Our study shows, for the first time, chemical attraction between two highly invasive freshwater species, thereby providing a plausible mechanism for invasion facilitation. This has implications for managing the spread of killer shrimp, and perhaps other freshwater invasive species, because chemical attraction could significantly increase establishment success in mutualistic systems. Failure to consider invasion facilitation may underestimate the risk of establishment, and likely also the impact of some aquatic invaders.},

	abstract = {Although the ecosystem transforming impact of the invasive dreissenid mussels has been widely reported in short-to-mid time scale studies, little is known about the contribution of the spent shells to sediments accumulating on the lake bottom. The question whether the shell production significantly reduces the lifespan of the lake by increasing sedimentation rate is particularly interesting in those shallow lakes where the calcium supply is sufficient to maintain the high mussel biomass production permanently, and where the alkaline water does not favor shell dissolution. Lake Balaton, a large calcareous, shallow lake in Central Europe invaded by dreissenids (Dreissena polymorpha, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), provides an ideal testing ground for this scenario. Therefore, we made calculations based on recent population abundance datasets (2000–2018), estimated the whole habitable, hard surface coastline and the muddy bottom of the pelagic area which is also gradually becoming inhabited by D. r. bugensis, using high resolution aerial photographs and analyzing seismic sections. We created four scenarios: (1) if no dreissenids are present (applying basic sedimentation rate); (2) if D. r. bugensis had not been introduced to the lake (only D. polymorpha); (3) if D. r. bugensis occupies the hard surfaces of the coastline (the current dominant situation); (4) if D. r. bugensis colonizes the entire lake bottom (a probable future model). Different sedimentation rates obtained from the literature were used to model the filling of Lake Balaton. The shell production of the new invader, D. r. bugensis can shorten the lake’s lifespan by one to two-thirds, depending on the model, and whether the mussel density currently observed at the shoreline is extended to the whole lake bottom. Attention is called to shallow calcareous lakes with low pre-invasion sedimentation rates in which the shell contribution of invasive mollusks has the potential to shorten lifespan.},

Here, we explore niche dynamic processes using the complex invasion history model of Lilium lancifolium, which is the first tested case of a native species (Korea) with two hypothesized spatial (regional and intercontinental) and temporal arrivals: (1) as an archaeophyte in East Asia (before AD 1500); and (2) as a neophyte in Europe, North America, Australia, and New Zealand (after AD 1500). Following a niche examination through both environmental and geographical spaces, the species in the archaeophyte range has apparently filled the ancestral native niche and, rather, would have increased it considerably. The species as a neophyte shows a closer climatic match with the archaeophyte range than with the native one. This pattern of niche similarity suggests that the neophyte range was probably colonized by a subset of archaeophyte propagules adapted to local climate that promoted the species’ establishment. Overall, niche conservatism is proposed at each colonization step, from native to archaeophyte, and from archaeophyte to neophyte ranges. We detected signals of an advanced invasion stage within the archaeophyte range and traces of an early introduction stage in neophyte ranges.},

	abstract = {A liquid formulation of acid-stabilized ionic copper called EarthTec QZ was used in an effort to eradicate invasive quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) from an entire 12-hectare lake in Pennsylvania in fall of 2017. The treatment consisted of three separate applications of ionic copper delivered over a period of 37 days with the intent to minimize likelihood of spreading invasive mussels during a one-time water transfer event planned for later that year, from the treated lake to an adjacent river. Mussel mortality was estimated through use of caged adult mussels that were suspended at different locations and depths throughout the lake. Adult mussels began to die within 3 days of the initiation of treatment, particularly in the top 6 meters of the water body. The death of the last caged mussel was confirmed 40 days after the initiation of treatment, in a cage that had been placed in the metalimnion at a depth of 9 meters below the surface. Both biological and physicochemical data collected during the treatment period revealed that there was a pronounced thermocline at 8–11 meters depth. The layer of water in the thermocline resisted mixing, suggesting an explanation for why mussels located above and below this metalimnion were eradicated quickly, yet those within the metalimnion required targeted treatment techniques and 40 days to succumb to 100\% mortality. Visual inspection of the shoreline after partial pump-down of the quarry in early November revealed high densities of empty shells from dead adults, and no live adults were found. Analysis of eDNA samples taken in December of 2017 and again in July 2018 concluded no mussel eDNA was detectable. Plankton tows collected and analyzed by microscopy in July, August and September 2018 were rich with zooplankton but no live mussel veligers were found. The cumulative sum of product applied throughout the entire course of treatment totaled 13,500 liters, which is equivalent to 0.44 mg/L as copper as calculated on the full volume of the lake – noteworthy because it is less than half the concentration EPA allows (1.0 mg/L) in a single algaecide treatment. This experience illustrates that low doses of acid-stabilized ionic copper can have profound effects on invasive mussel populations and are a viable management tool. If future sampling confirms that this eradication effort was successful, it will be the first recorded instance of eradicating quagga mussels from an entire lake.},

	abstract = {The costs of invasive species in the United States alone are estimated to exceed US\$100 billion per year, so a critical tactic in minimizing the costs of invasive species is the development of effective, early‐detection systems. To this end, we evaluated the efficacy of adding environmental (e)DNA surveillance to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) streamgage network, which consists of {\textgreater}8200 streamgages nationwide systemically visited by USGS hydrologic technicians. Incorporating strategic eDNA sample collection during routine streamgage visits could provide early‐detection surveillance of aquatic invasive species with minimal additional cost. For this evaluation, USGS hydrologic technicians collected monthly eDNA water samples, May–September 2018, from streamgages downstream of reservoirs in the Columbia River Basin thought to be vulnerable to invasive dreissenid mussel (Dreissenidae spp.) establishment. We tested water samples for dreissenid mussel DNA and also for kokanee (Oncorhynchus nerka) and yellow perch (Perca flavescens) DNA; the two fishes were used to assess if streamgages are adequately located to provide early‐detection eDNA surveillance of taxa known to be present in upstream reservoirs. No Columbia River Basin streamgage samples met our criteria for being scored as positive for dreissenid DNA. We did detect kokanee and yellow perch DNA at all streamgages downstream of reservoirs where these species are known to occur. Field collection, laboratory analyses, and personnel time required for collection of four eDNA samples at a streamgage site cost US\$500–US\$600 (net). Given these results, incorporating eDNA biosurveillance into routine streamgage visits might decrease costs associated with an invasion since early detection maximizes the potential for eradication, containment, and mitigation.},

	abstract = {AimTo investigate if connectivity and zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) occurrence can mitigate effects of eutrophication in a lowland lake landscape.LocationUpper Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, UK.MethodsData on environment, macrophytes and invertebrates were assembled for three basins of a large central lake and its satellite floodplain lakes via field surveys and palaeolimnological analyses. Space–time interaction analyses of palaeoecological data were compared pre‐1950 and post‐1950. Multivariate analyses examined how connectivity, environment and zebra mussels influenced contemporary lake communities, and explain their divergence from historical communities in the past.ResultsPre‐1950, we found high community variation across sites and low within‐lake variation in macrophytes, but progressive eutrophication accentuated within‐lake community variation after 1950. Partitioning analysis showed larger effects of connectivity than nutrient enrichment on contemporary macrophyte composition, while local effects structured invertebrate communities. Three clusters of lakes were revealed according to variation in macrophyte composition, isolation from the central lake and nutrient enrichment: Group 1– the central lake and six nearby lakes were meso‐eutrophic (TP = 66.7 ± 47.6 μg/L; TN = 0.79 ± 0.41 mg/L) and had the highest zebra mussel abundances and organismal biodiversity; Group 2– Eight eutrophic (TP = 112±36.6 μg/L; TN = 1.25 ± 0.5 mg/L) and connected lakes; Group 3– Seven isolated and hypertrophic (TP = 163.2 ± 101.5 μg/L; TN = 1.55 ± 0.3 mg/L) lakes. Pre‐1950 palaeolimnological data for macrophytes and invertebrates for 5 lakes and a basin in the central lake most resembled extant lake communities of Group 1. However, palaeo‐records revealed that macrophytes and invertebrates subsequently converged towards those of Groups 2 and 3.Main conclusionsOur study reveals that the central “mother” lake acts as a hub for preserving biodiversity via shared hydrological connectivity with satellite lakes and high zebra mussel abundances. These may buffer the impoverishing effects of eutrophication and sustain unexpectedly high biodiversity in the short term. Such protective buffering, however, cannot be relied upon indefinitely to conserve biodiversity.},

	abstract = {The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, continues to spread from its native range in Eurasia to Europe and North America, causing billions of dollars in damage and dramatically altering invaded aquatic ecosystems. Despite these impacts, there are few genomic resources for Dreissena or related bivalves, with nearly 450 million years of divergence between zebra mussels and its closest sequenced relative. Although the D. polymorpha genome is highly repetitive, we have used a combination of long-read sequencing and Hi-C-based scaffolding to generate the highest quality molluscan assembly to date. Through comparative analysis and transcriptomics experiments we have gained insights into processes that likely control the invasive success of zebra mussels, including shell formation, synthesis of byssal threads, and thermal tolerance. We identified multiple intact Steamer-Like Elements, a retrotransposon that has been linked to transmissible cancer in marine clams. We also found that D. polymorpha have an unusual 67 kb mitochondrial genome containing numerous tandem repeats, making it the largest observed in Eumetazoa. Together these findings create a rich resource for invasive species research and control efforts.

	abstract = {Tools that bolster early detection of invasive dreissenid mussels are needed to prevent their spread across western North America. In this study, we assessed if environmental DNA (eDNA) can extend the seasonal window for dreissenid mussel early detection beyond that of plankton tows, which are limited to warmer seasons when mussel larvae are present. We focused eDNA sampling efforts at multiple sites in Tiber Reservoir (Montana) where dreissenid mussel abundance is hypothesized to be low. Samples were collected in June and October 2017, when water temperatures were cooler than thermal optima for dreissenid reproduction, and in July 2017 when water temperatures were warmer and conducive for reproduction. We detected dreissenid mussel DNA in June, July and October even though no dreissenid mussels were observed using non-molecular tools in 2017. A subset of positive and negative eDNA samples was analyzed by an independent lab and results were corroborated. We then estimated the effort needed for 95\% probability detection of dreissenid DNA at each site within Tiber Reservoir and found that as many as 27, 14, and 34 samples needed to be collected in June, July and October, respectively. To further validate the utility of eDNA, we also present ancillary eDNA results from other waters in the Flathead Reservation (Montana) where dreissenid mussels have never been detected and from waters with established zebra mussel populations in the upper Mississippi River, which were sampled in the spring when water temperatures were cooler than thermal optima for dreissenid reproduction. All Flathead Reservation samples were negative for dreissenid mussel DNA, while all upper Mississippi River samples were positive. This study adds to a growing body of research that demonstrates eDNA is a highly sensitive tool for dreissenid mussel surveillance in newly invaded waters, including colder seasons when non-molecular tools are likely to be less effective or more challenging to employ.},

More attention is being focused on how climate change impacts the performance of co‐occurring native and introduced species. No synthesis has solely examined how invasive plant and animal species perform under climate change across both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. We asked the following questions: (1) How will combined and single climate change factors influence the performance of non‐native species? (2) Which habitat types are more affected by climate factors in a combined or single manner? (3) What guilds/functional groups, within aquatic vs. terrestrial habitats, are more impacted by climate factors? To better understand this, we conducted a meta‐analysis examining the relative influence climate change factors (carbon dioxide (CO2)/acidification, temperature, precipitation) have on invasive species’ performance. Our results indicate that global change factors had an overall increased performance on invasive species in terrestrial habitats with an opposite effect observed in aquatic habitats. Plant functional groups were positively affected, whereas animal guilds were generally negatively impacted by global changes. Our findings suggest that while invasive taxa are affected differently by global changes, responses are confounded by habitat type, and, therefore, to fully understand global change impacts on invasive taxa, increased representation of animal studies in terrestrial systems and plants in aquatic systems is needed.},

	abstract = {Dreissenid mussels (including the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha and the quagga mussel D. rostriformis) are among the world's most notorious invasive species, with large and widespread ecological and economic effects. However, their long‐term population dynamics are poorly known, even though these dynamics are critical to determining impacts and effective management. We gathered and analyzed 67 long‐term ({\textgreater}10 yr) data sets on dreissenid populations from lakes and rivers across Europe and North America. We addressed five questions: (1) How do Dreissena populations change through time? (2) Specifically, do Dreissena populations decline substantially after an initial outbreak phase? (3) Do different measures of population performance (biomass or density of settled animals, veliger density, recruitment of young) follow the same patterns through time? (4) How do the numbers or biomass of zebra mussels or of both species combined change after the quagga mussel arrives? (5) How does body size change over time? We also considered whether current data on long‐term dynamics of Dreissena populations are adequate for science and management. Individual Dreissena populations showed a wide range of temporal dynamics, but we could detect only two general patterns that applied across many populations: (1) Populations of both species increased rapidly in the first 1–2 yr after appearance, and (2) quagga mussels appeared later than zebra mussels and usually quickly caused large declines in zebra mussel populations. We found little evidence that combined Dreissena populations declined over the long term. Different measures of population performance were not congruent; the temporal dynamics of one life stage or population attribute cannot generally be accurately inferred from the dynamics of another. We found no consistent patterns in the long‐term dynamics of body size. The long‐term dynamics of Dreissena populations probably are driven by the ecological characteristics (e.g., predation, nutrient inputs, water temperature) and their temporal changes at individual sites rather than following a generalized time course that applies across many sites. Existing long‐term data sets on dreissenid populations, although clearly valuable, are inadequate to meet research and management needs. Data sets could be improved by standardizing sampling designs and methods, routinely collecting more variables, and increasing support.},

	abstract = {Non-native species are a major driver of environmental change. In this study we assessed the ecological impact of the “worst” non-native species and the associated scientific and media publications through time to understand what influences interest in these species. Ecological effect was based on a qualitative assessment reported in research publications and additional searches of the scientific and media attention were conducted to determine published articles and assess attention. We did not detect a relationship between the number of publications for a non-native species and the magnitude of the ecological effects of that species or the number of citations. Media coverage on non-native species was low, only evident for less than 50\% of the non-native species assessed. Media coverage was initially related to the number of scientific publications, but was short-lived. In contrast, the attention to individual non-native species in the scientific literature was sustained through time and often continued to increase over time. Time between detection of the non-native species and the scientific/media attention were reduced with each successive introduction to a new geographic location. Tracking publications on non-native species indicated that media attention does seem to be associated with the production of scientific research while scientific attention was not related to the magnitude of the ecological effects.},

	abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are an aquatic invasive species that plague much of North America and are difficult to impossible to eradicate once they become established. Therefore, prevention and monitoring are key elements in the control of these organisms. Traditional microscopy is commonly used in monitoring but requires the presence of larval veligers. This limits the times when resource managers can monitor for the presence in northern lakes. A new monitoring tool, environmental DNA (eDNA), may allow for a more efficient and cost-effective monitoring program for zebra mussels. We developed and tested an environmental DNA assay in the fall and spring for zebra mussels in two Minnesota lakes, one heavily infested and another newly infested. We found that DNA copy numbers tended to be higher near the lake bottom and DNA was more concentrated in softer substrates. We also found that the amount of zebra mussel DNA sampling in winter resulted in similar results to when sampled in fall. This suggests that one could collect and analyze eDNA for zebra mussels during winter months to help inform future efforts in monitoring and control.},

	abstract = {Identifying species and population genetic compositions of biological invasions at early life stages and/or from environmental (e)DNA using targeted high‐throughput sequencing (HTS) metabarcode assays offers powerful and cost‐effective means for early detection, analysis of spread patterns, and evaluating population changes. The present study develops, tests, and applies this method with a targeted sequence assay designed to simultaneously identify and distinguish between the closely related invasive Eurasian zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. rostriformis) and their relatives and discern their respective population genetic patterns. Invasions of these dreissenid mussel species have markedly changed freshwater ecosystems throughout North America and Europe, exerting severe ecological and economic damage. Their planktonic early life stages (eggs and larvae) are morphologically indistinguishable, yet each species exerts differential ecological effects, with the quagga often outcompeting the zebra mussel as adults. Our targeted assay analyzes genetic variation from a diagnostic sequence region of the mitochondrial (mt)DNA cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene, to assess temporal and spatial inter‐ and intra‐specific genetic variability. The assay facilitates analysis of environmental (e)DNA from water, early life stages from thousands of individuals, and simultaneous analysis of 50–100 tagged field‐collected samples. Experiments evaluated its accuracy and performance using: (a) mock laboratory communities containing known DNA quantities per taxon, (b) aquaria with mixed‐species/haplotype compositions of adults, and (c) field‐collected water and plankton versus traditional sampling of adult communities. Results delineated species compositions, relative abundances, and population‐level diversity differences among ecosystems, habitats, time series, and life stages from two allopatric concurrent invasions in the Great Lakes (Lake Erie) and the Hudson River, which had separate founding histories. Findings demonstrate application of this targeted assay and our approach to accurately and simultaneously discern species‐ and population‐level differences across spatial and temporal scales, facilitating early detection and ecological understanding of biological invasions.},

In the Szczecin Lagoon (a southern Baltic coastal lagoon), the quagga was recorded for the first time in 2014 and found to co-occur with the zebra mussel, a long-time resident of the Lagoon. As the two species are suspected of being competitors where they co-occur, their population dynamics was followed at a site the new immigrant was discovered (station ZS6, northern part of the Lagoon) by collecting monthly samples in 2015-2017. The abundance and biomass of the two congeners showed wide fluctuations, significant differences being recorded between months within a year and between years. The abundance and biomass proportions between the two congeners changed from an initial domination of the newcomer quagga until mid-2015 to a persistent domination of the zebra mussel throughout the remainder of the study period. Both the abundance and biomass of the two dreissenids showed a number of significant associations with environmental variables, notably with salinity, chlorophyll a content, and temperature. The co-occurrence of the two dreissenids in the Lagoon is discussed in the context of their invasion stage; it is concluded that while the quagga seems to have achieved the “outbreak” stage, the zebra mussel, an “accommodated” invader present prior to the quagga immigration, reverted to that stage.},

	abstract = {Finding suitable places to establish a mussel farm is challenging, as many aspects like mussel growth, clearance effect and the risk of low oxygen conditions, have to be considered. We present a tailor-made approach, combining field experiments with a spatially explicit model tool, to support the planning process. A case study was set up in the German part of Szczecin (Oder) Lagoon (Baltic Sea), as it shows all typical eutrophication problems and has a strong need and high potential for nutrient retention measures. Farming zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) is an innovative approach that utilizes a species which is often perceived as a pest. The practical applicability and water quality improvement potential was proven by a pilot farm. Combining the gained knowledge with the simulation model led to a cascade of mussel farm options that differ in purpose, location and biomass. Placing a mussel farm in an enclosed bay resulted in a remarkable water quality improvement (Secchi Depth increased up to 2 m), but the effect stayed local, the growth was limited and the potential annual nutrient removal reached a threshold of approximately 30 t N and 2.8 t P. The same nutrient removal could be reached with much smaller farms in an open sea area, whereas the change of water transparency or bottom oxygen conditions were neglectable. A maximal nutrient removal potential of 1,750 t N and 160 t P per year was estimated, when nearly the entire German part of Szczecin Lagoon with mussel farms was used. This led to a strong reduction of phytoplankton and an increase of Secchi Depth, but also a rising risk of anoxia. Overall, all mussel farm options are only a supportive measure, but not sufficient to reach the Good Environmental Status demanded by the Water Framework Directive. At once, the nutrient export from Szczecin Lagoon to the open Baltic was reduced by up to 3,500 t N and 420 t P per year, making the large-scale mussel farm option also a potential measure within the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.},

Different filtering techniques carried out on the banks of the Ebro (EB) and Júcar (JU) rivers (Eastern Spain) in different water conditions are compared. Low volume water filtration from the banks is a method sensitive enough to detect variations in larval density due to water temperature and flow rates. The EB densities were lower and related to the temperature of the water. In JU, different spawning strategies and a much extended period of larval releasing into the water occurred in two consecutive years. The presence of larvae in both rivers was constant for many months of the year, during which various reproductive cycles occurred, facilitated by high water temperatures during mid-spring to late fall. Shoreline surveys can be easily used for allowing the early warning of the presence of this dangerous invasive species, mitigating damages and preventing its spread into new areas.

The highly invasive non-native apple snail Pomacea maculata has raised such concerns as it has become established in a wide range of aquatic systems worldwide. While monitoring native Florida P. paludosa populations in Lake Tohopekaliga (LTOHO) from 2001 to 2009 and in Water Conservation Area 3A (WCA3A, Everglades) from 2006 to 2015, we opportunistically documented the establishment and distribution of P. maculata. We estimated snail densities and recorded egg cluster presence in three study sites (12 total plots, LTOHO) and 137 sites (WCA3). On LTOHO, native snails were absent or at very low densities prior to finding P. maculata. Few snails of either species were found in high-stem-density vegetation of the littoral zone. Pomacea maculata immigration into the littoral zone occurred following managed vegetation removal, and Hydrilla verticillata proliferation in LTOHO likely contributed to the spread of P. maculata. We found both native and non-native apple snail species in many WCA3A sites following P. maculata invasion. We initially found the non-native snail in two sites in southern WCA3A; they were mostly restricted to within three kilometers of initial sites over the next four years. Overall plant community compositions in LTOHO and WCA3A appeared less impacted than expected based on previous reports of P. maculata invasions.},

	abstract = {Challenges for R0 for Environmentally Maintained Pathogens For pathogens, such as Bacillus anthracis [9], the causative bacterium of anthrax, and chronic wasting disease (CWD) [10], that persist in spatially limited environmental reservoirs, estimates of R0 to date have not explicitly included their spatial structure, which can be characterized as a distribution of host carcass-generated local infectious zones (LIZs) distributed over the landscape.

By way of example, in Figure 1 we illustrate anthrax transmission (as an example of environmental transmission) on two landscapes: (1) the scrub habitat of west Texas (left panel), where blow flies [33] and biting flies [34] can increase local case intensity of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) predominantly browsing during the outbreak season; and (2) the grasslands of Etosha National Park in Namibia (Etosha; right panel), where grazing near LIZs during the wet season is the primary mode of transmission [11,12].

In the case of soil-borne B. anthracis, recent studies on the environmental conditions that support pathogen persistence include ecological niche modeling [37,38,39]), host seasonal resource selection in risk areas [40], host foraging behavior at LIZs [11,41], seasonal changes in host diet [12], and seasonal fluctuations in host antibody titers to B. anthracis [42].

[...]in the case of the water-borne bacterium Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, sufficient data exist [26,37,40] to construct strategic models that account for transmission enhancement and seasonal affects through V. cholerae associations with zooplankton [23,24,41,42].},

	abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) have continued their spread within inland lakes and rivers in North America despite diligent containment and decontamination efforts by natural resource agencies and other stakeholders. Identification of newly infested waterways by early detection surveillance programs allows for rapid response zebra mussel eradication treatments in some situations. Previous eradication treatments have occurred over a broad range of water temperatures which have influenced the efficacy of molluscicides. Natural resource managers will benefit from knowledge regarding the impacts of water temperature and exposure duration on the toxicity of molluscicides to zebra mussels. In particular, temperature specific data are needed to inform the selection of an effective molluscicide and the proper dose that will induce 100\% zebra mussel mortality. We evaluated the influences of temperature and exposure duration on the toxicity of two U.S. EPA-registered (EarthTec QZ and Zequanox) and two nonregistered (niclosamide and potassium chloride) molluscicides to zebra mussels at water temperatures of 7, 12, 17, and 22 °C. Our results indicate that treatment options for the eradication of zebra mussels in waters ≤ 12 °C include 336 h or longer treatments with EarthTec QZ and KCl as well as treatments with niclosamide ≥ 24 h in duration. In waters ≥ 17 °C, multiple toxicant and exposure duration combinations are potentially effective for zebra mussel eradication. On-site or in situ zebra mussel bioassays are a useful tool for the evaluation of treatment efficacy.},

There is a need for more environmentally neutral tools to manage dreissenid mussels, particularly in cooler water. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has been shown to be lethal to several species of invasive bivalves, including zebra mussels and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea). We evaluated the effectiveness of unpressurized infusion of CO2 for 24 to 96 h (100 000–300 000 µatm PCO2) at a water temperature of 12 °C on mortality, byssal thread formation, and attachment of zebra mussels. The safety of elevated CO2 to a nontarget native freshwater mussel (Fatmucket, Lampsilis siliquoidea) was also determined. Elevated PCO2 exposure induced narcotization and reduced attachment of zebra mussels within 24 h. Mortality increased with exposure duration and PCO2. An estimated LT50 (lethal time to produce 50\% mortality) for fixed PCO2 ranged from 24 h at 275 000 µatm to {\textasciitilde} 96 h at 100 000 µatm. Exposure of zebra mussels to CO2 for 96 h caused 80–100\% mortality at all treatment levels. Fatmucket juveniles survived all PCO2 treatments but burial and byssal thread production were adversely affected during exposure. Our results demonstrate that CO2 is a viable option for management of zebra mussels in cool water and may have less adverse effect for native lampsiline mussels than current-use molluscicides.},

	abstract = {Methods to reduce the introduction and spread of Invasive Alien Species (IAS) are key to reducing the economic, environmental and social impacts of IAS. IAS propagules can be moved around accidentally on clothing and equipment used in agriculture, transport, trade and recreation. Campaigns to slow the spread of aquatic IAS encourage water users to check, clean and dry their equipment and clothes, using hot water during the cleaning process where feasible. The UK Check Clean Dry biosecurity campaign recommends immersion in hot water (45 °C) for 15 minutes, however, implementation time may be a barrier to adoption of biosecurity practices. Here we aim to refine the advice given and test the efficacy of hot water treatment in actual conditions, with a view to reduce the recommended time to clean equipment while still preventing spread. The effectiveness was tested for a range of temperature (40, 45, 50, 55 and 60 °C) and time (10 seconds, 1, 5, 10, 15 minutes) treatments in killing IAS propagules of two invasive aquatic animal species (Dreissena polymorpha, Dikerogammarus villosus) and two invasive aquatic plant species (Myriophyllum aquaticum, Crassula helmsii), which are of global/national importance. For both invasive animal species, 100\% mortality was achieved at all temperature and time treatments. However, plant mortality was affected by both temperature and time, with higher mortality resulting from higher temperatures and exposure times. Immersion for the recommended 15 mins at 45 °C caused complete mortality of C. helmsii, but only 40\% mortality of M. aquaticum. Immersion in water at 50 °C or higher led to 100\% mortality for C. helmsii and 90\% mortality for M. aquatium at shorter treatment durations of 5 or 10 mins. In addition, immersion in water at 60 °C caused 100\% mortality after only 1 minute exposure. To ensure adoption and application of biosecurity practices, guidance should be simple, consistent and safe. For practical application in field we recommend, where feasible, immersion of equipment in water at 50 °C for a minimum of 5 minutes to achieve high mortality of IAS propagules.},

Lake sturgeon diets vary considerably across their range and depend on the local benthic invertebrate fauna, substrata, and competition with congener species. Hence, determining population-specific prey assemblages is a vital contribution to effective conservation efforts. We used carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes to identify lake sturgeon prey preferences for juvenile ({\textless}100 cm) and adult ({\textgreater}100 cm) age classes and their trophic niche in the Saskatchewan River, SK, Canada. In this system, lake sturgeon were the top predator within the benthic food web with no direct competition for preferred prey items from congener species. Their diet was dominated by crayfish (49.1± 6.4\%) and snails (36.3 ± 5.5\%), with no significant differences between age classes. Furthermore, lake sturgeon favoured deep rocky pools throughout the river; a habitat where crayfish and snails are typically found. Therefore, conservation efforts should be directed at preserving these habitats for the residing benthic invertebrate community, and the lake sturgeon’s ability to access them.},

	abstract = {Early detection is paramount for attempts to remove invasive non-native species (INNS). Traditional methods rely on physical sampling and morphological identification, which can be problematic when species are in low densities and/or are cryptic. The use of environmental DNA (eDNA) as a monitoring tool in freshwater systems is becoming increasingly acceptable and widely used for the detection of single species. Here we demonstrate the development and application of standard PCR primers for the detection of four freshwater invasive species which are high priority for monitoring in the UK and elsewhere: Dreissenid mussels; Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1987) and D. polymorpha (Pallas, 1771), and Gammarid shrimps; Dikerogammarus villosus (Sowinsky, 1984) and D. haemobaphes (Eichwald, 1843). We carried out a rigorous validation process for testing the new primers, including DNA detection and degradation rate experiments in mesocosm, and a field comparison with traditional monitoring protocols. We successfully detected all four target species in mesocosms, but success was higher for mussels than shrimps. eDNA from single individuals of both mussel species could be detected within four hours of the start of the experiment. By contrast, shrimp were only consistently detected at higher densities (20 individuals). In field trials, the two mussel species and D. haemobaphes were detected at all sites where the species are known to be present, and eDNA consistently outperformed traditional kick sampling for species detection. However, D. villosus eDNA was only detected in one of five sites where the species was confirmed by kick sampling. These results demonstrate the applicability of standard PCR for eDNA detection of freshwater invasive species, but also highlight the importance of differences between taxa in terms of the detection ability.},

	abstract = {International and national guidelines and regulations to limit the inadvertent transfer of non-native species on the submerged surfaces of vessels and mobile infrastructure are progressing. However, methods to assess compliance must be developed to assist both regulators and industry. While there is a history of biofouling inspections in maritime industries, including commercial shipping and infrastructure, such surveys are tailored for vessel safety and performance rather than being driven by biosecurity purposes. Thus, these inspections are likely inadequate for confirming compliance with biosecurity regulations. To determine regulatory compliance, agencies will likely rely on a combination of risk profiling, assessment of documentation of biofouling management, archival data and images, and real-time in-water surveys made by divers or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) specific to biosecurity regulations. Divers may exceed ROVs at finding organisms in recesses and other topographically complex areas, and when regulations require confirmation of species identity or viability. In contrast, ROVs may be well suited for regulations that establish upper thresholds on biofouling levels with little concern for organism identity or condition. Several factors will inform how a survey is conducted, including cost, the type of data required by regulations, environmental conditions, safety, and logistics. Survey designs and requirements should be transparent to manage industry’s expectations of border procedures, to increase the efficiency with which industry and agencies manage biofouling and potentially align the evaluation of best practices in hull and niche area maintenance across jurisdictions.},

	doi = {10.1002/ecs2.2406},
	abstract = {Eutrophication is commonly implicated in the reduction in macrophyte species richness in shallow lakes. However, the extent to which other more nuanced measures of macrophyte diversity, such as assemblage heterogeneity, are impacted concurrently by eutrophication over space and time and the joint influences of other factors (e.g., species invasions and connectivity) remains relatively poorly documented. Using a combination of contemporary and paleoecological data, we examine how eutrophication influences macrophyte assemblage heterogeneity and how nutrient enrichment interacts with watercourse connectivity, lake surface area, and relative zebra mussel abundance over space (within and among lakes) and time (decades to centuries) at the landscape scale. The study system is the Upper Lough Erne, Northern Ireland, UK, which is composed of a large main lake and several smaller satellite lakes that vary in their hydrological connectivity to the main lake. By applying homogeneity analysis of multivariate dispersions and partial redundancy analysis, we demonstrate that contemporary lake macrophyte heterogeneity and species richness are reduced in lakes with intensified eutrophication but are increased in lakes with greater zebra mussel abundance and lake surface area. Watercourse connectivity positively influenced assemblage heterogeneity and explained larger proportions of the variation in assemblage heterogeneity than local environmental factors, whereas variation in species richness was better related to local abiotic factors. Macrophyte fossil data revealed within‐ and among‐lake assemblage homogenization post‐1960, with the main lake and connected sites showing the highest rates of homogenization due to progressive eutrophication. The long‐term and contemporary data collectively indicate that eutrophication reduces assemblage heterogeneity over time by overriding the importance of regional processes (e.g., connectivity) and exerts stronger pressure on isolated lakes. Our results suggest further that in connected lake systems, assemblage heterogeneity may be impacted more rapidly by eutrophication than species richness. This means that early effects of eutrophication in many systems may be underestimated by monitoring that focuses solely on species richness and is not performed at adequate landscape scales.},

We provide a synopsis of key historical milestones for marine bioinvasions, including timelines of (a) discovery and understanding of the invasion process, focusing on transfer mechanisms and outcomes, (b) methodologies used for detection and monitoring, (c) approaches to ecological impacts research, and (d) management and policy responses. Early (until the mid-1900s) marine bioinvasions were given little attention, and in a number of cases actively and routinely facilitated. Beginning in the second half of the 20th century, several conspicuous non-indigenous species outbreaks with strong environmental, economic, and public health impacts raised widespread concerns and initiated shifts in public and scientific perceptions. These high-profile invasions led to policy documents and strategies to reduce the introduction and spread of non-indigenous species, although with significant time lags and limited success and focused on only a subset of transfer mechanisms. Integrated, multi-vector management within an ecosystem-based marine management context is urgently needed to address the complex interactions of natural and human pressures that drive invasions in marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {The environmental fate, persistence, and non-target animal impacts of traditional molluscicides for zebra, Dreissena polymorpha, and quagga, D. bugensis, mussel control led to the development of the biomolluscicide Zequanox. Although previous research has demonstrated the specificity of Zequanox, one study indicated sensitivity of salmonids and lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, following non-label compliant exposures to Zequanox. This study was conducted to evaluate sublethal and lethal impacts of Zequanox exposure on juvenile lake sturgeon and lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush, following applications that were conducted in a manner consistent with the Zequanox product label. Fish were exposed to 50 or 100 mg/L of Zequanox as active ingredient for 8 h and then held for 33 d to evaluate latent impacts. No acute mortality was observed in either species; however, significant latent mortality (P {\textless} 0.01, df = 9; 46.2\%) was observed in lake trout that were exposed to the highest dose of Zequanox. Statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.03, df = 9), but biologically minimal differences were observed in the weight (range 20.17 to 21.49 g) of surviving lake sturgeon at the termination of the 33 d post-exposure observation period. Statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.05, df = 9) and biologically considerable differences were observed in the weight (range 6.19 to 9.55 g) of surviving lake trout at the termination of the 33 d post-exposure observation period. Histologic evaluation of lake trout gastrointestinal tracts suggests that the mode of action in lake trout is different from the mode of action that induces zebra and quagga mussel mortality. Further research could determine the sensitivity of other salmonid species to Zequanox and determine if native fish will avoid Zequanox treated water.},

	abstract = {In invasive species ecology, risk identification is an essential first step of the overall risk analysis process. In this study, 24 non-native freshwater macroinvertebrate species were screened for their level of risk of invasiveness in the Dnieper, Pripyat and Neman rivers and associated basins of Belarus. Using the recently-developed Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS-ISK), the threshold values of 12.25 for the Basic Risk Assessment (BRA) and 19.5 for the BRA + CCA (Climate Change Assessment) allowed identifying those species likely to be of high risk of invasiveness in the risk assessment area. For the BRA+CCA, the highest-scoring species were zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, spinycheek crayfish Orconectes limosus, quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis and Caspian mud shrimp Chelicorophium curvispinum, and for the BRA only signal crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus. For all species but one (namely, fragile ancylid Ferrissia fragilis classified as low risk), the CCA resulted in an increase in score relative to the BRA, indicating that predicted future global warming conditions are likely to exacerbate the detrimental impacts of the non-native macroinvertebrates of Ponto-Caspian origin. The present application of AS-ISK confirms the predictive value of the tool, and benefits from incorporation of future climate change scenarios. This is a crucial step for the provision of guidelines for the successful management of non-native invasive species and conservation of native faunas in the (invaded) habitats of Belarus.},

	abstract = {Plant species disjunctions have attracted the interest of ecologists for decades. We investigated Trichloris crinita, a native C4 perennial grass with disjunct distribution between subtropical regions of North and South America, testing the hypothesis that the species has a similar realized climatic niche in both subcontinents. The climatic niche of T. crinita in North and South America was characterized and compared using presence records and five uncorrelated bioclimatic variables selected according to their ecological importance for the species. We used reciprocal modeling to make geographic projections of the realized niche within each subcontinent. Niche overlap between T. crinita distributions in North and South America was intermediate for the individual climatic variables and the multivariate space. In all cases the test of equivalence between climates inhabited by T. crinita indicated that the realized niche of the species differ significantly between subcontinents. Also, the similarity test showed that in the majority of cases the realized niche in both subcontinents was significantly different than that expected by chance. T. crinita occupied a greater diversity of environments in South than in North America, while in the latter its distribution was displaced to drier and warmer environments. The modeled geographic distribution using the actual occurrences of the species in North America did not accurately predict the distribution in South America, and vice versa. Together, these results led us to reject the hypothesis of similar niche of T. crinita in both subcontinents. This information may be useful to manage restoration efforts by presenting the suitable areas and climates for the species, and suggesting that translocation of individuals between subcontinents could only be recommended with caution because introduced genotypes can be potentially maladaptive, and could colonize sites actually not occupied by the species within each subcontinent.},

	abstract = {Predictive studies are of paramount importance for biological invasions, one of the biggest threats for biodiversity. To help and better prioritize management strategies, species distribution models (SDMs) are often used to predict the potential invasive range of introduced species. Yet, SDMs have been regularly criticized, due to several strong limitations, such as violating the equilibrium assumption during the invasion process. Unfortunately, validation studies–with independent data–are too scarce to assess the predictive accuracy of SDMs in invasion biology. Yet, biological invasions allow to test SDMs usefulness, by retrospectively assessing whether they would have accurately predicted the latest ranges of invasion. Here, we assess the predictive accuracy of SDMs in predicting the expansion of invasive species. We used temporal occurrence data for the Asian hornet Vespa velutina nigrithorax, a species native to China that is invading Europe with a very fast rate. Specifically, we compared occurrence data from the last stage of invasion (independent validation points) to the climate suitability distribution predicted from models calibrated with data from the early stage of invasion. Despite the invasive species not being at equilibrium yet, the predicted climate suitability of validation points was high. SDMs can thus adequately predict the spread of V. v. nigrithorax, which appears to be—at least partially–climatically driven. In the case of V. v. nigrithorax, SDMs predictive accuracy was slightly but significantly better when models were calibrated with invasive data only, excluding native data. Although more validation studies for other invasion cases are needed to generalize our results, our findings are an important step towards validating the use of SDMs in invasion biology.},

Detailed knowledge regarding the underlying mechanisms that induce bio-calcification after ESWT is limited. We analyzed the biological response within mineralized tissue of a new invertebrate model organism, the zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha, after exposure with extracorporeal shock waves (ESWs). Mussels were exposed to ESWs with positive energy density of 0.4 mJ/mm2 (A) or were sham exposed (B). Detection of newly calcified tissue was performed by exposing the mussels to fluorescent markers. Two weeks later, the A-mussels showed a higher mean fluorescence signal intensity within the shell zone than the B-mussels (P{\textless}0.05). Acoustic measurements revealed that the increased mean fluorescence signal intensity within the shell of the A-mussels was independent of the size and position of the focal point of the ESWs. These data demonstrate that induction of bio-calcification after ESWT may not be restricted to the region of direct energy transfer of ESWs into calcified tissue. The results of the present study are of relevance for better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that induce formation of new mineralized tissue after ESWT.},

	abstract = {Differential tolerance to stress is partly responsible for the heterogeneity of biomarker responses between populations of a sentinel species. Although currently used for freshwater biomonitoring, studies concerning inter-populational variability in tolerance to contaminants for the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) are scarce. Moreover, this well-known invader is currently replaced by another, the quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). To evaluate the differential tolerance between dreissenids, several populations of both species were exposed to a high concentration of nickel. A LT50 (time when 50\% of individuals were dead) was established for each population. Biomarker responses and internal nickel concentration were also measured, to link tolerance with physiological status. Results evidenced that D. polymorpha populations are more heterogeneous and more tolerant than D. r. bugensis ones. For D. polymorpha populations only, LT50 values were positively correlated with the nickel contamination in situ, with higher anti-oxidative defences and a higher Integrated Biomarker Response value in the field. Such findings may be explained by local adaptation and invasion dynamic within each species. The significance of this differential tolerance when using biomarker responses for biomonitoring purposes is thus discussed.},

	abstract = {Habitat suitability models are useful to understand species distribution and to guide management and conservation strategies. The grey wolf (Canis lupus) has been extirpated from most of its historic range in Pakistan primarily due to its impact on livestock and livelihoods. We used non-invasive survey data from camera traps and genetic sampling to develop a habitat suitability model for C. lupus in northern Pakistan and to explore the extent of connectivity among populations. We detected suitable habitat of grey wolf using a maximum entropy approach (Maxent ver. 3.4.0) and identified suitable movement corridors using the Circuitscape 4.0 tool. Our model showed high levels of predictive performances, as seen from the values of area under curve (0.971±0.002) and true skill statistics (0.886±0.021). The main predictors for habitat suitability for C. lupus were distances to road, mean temperature of the wettest quarter and distance to river. The model predicted ca. 23,129 km2 of suitable areas for wolf in Pakistan, with much of suitable habitat in remote and inaccessible areas that appeared to be well connected through vulnerable movement corridors. These movement corridors suggest that potentially the wolf range can expand in Pakistan’s Northern Areas. However, managing protected areas with stringent restrictions is challenging in northern Pakistan, in part due to heavy dependence of people on natural resources. The habitat suitability map provided by this study can inform future management strategies by helping authorities to identify key conservation areas.},

	abstract = {Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of aquatic invasive species environmental DNA (AIS eDNA) was used for rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of Dreissena sp. relevant to the Great Lakes (USA) basin. The method was validated for two uses including i) direct amplification of eDNA using a hand filtration system and ii) confirmation of the results after DNA extraction using a conventional thermal cycler run at isothermal temperatures. Direct amplification eliminated the need for DNA extraction and purification and allowed detection of target invasive species in grab or concentrated surface water samples, containing both free DNA as well as larger cells and particulates, such as veligers, eggs, or seeds. The direct amplification method validation was conducted using Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena bugensis and uses up to 1 L grab water samples for high target abundance (e.g., greater than 10 veligers (larval mussels) per L for Dreissena sp.) or 20 L samples concentrated through 35 μm nylon screens for low target abundance, at less than 10 veligers per liter water. Surface water concentrate samples were collected over a period of three years, mostly from inland lakes in Michigan with the help of a network of volunteers. Field samples collected from 318 surface water locations included i) filtered concentrate for direct amplification validation and ii) 1 L grab water sample for eDNA extraction and confirmation. Though the extraction-based protocol was more sensitive (resulting in more positive detections than direct amplification), direct amplification could be used for rapid screening, allowing for quicker action times. For samples collected between May and August, results of eDNA direct amplification were consistent with known presence/absence of selected invasive species. A cross-platform smartphone application was also developed to disseminate the analyzed results to volunteers. Field tests of the direct amplification protocol using a portable device (Gene-Z) showed the method could be used in the field to obtain results within one hr (from sample to result). Overall, the direct amplification has the potential to simplify the eDNA-based monitoring of multiple aquatic invasive species. Additional studies are warranted to establish quantitative correlation between eDNA copy number, veliger, biomass or organismal abundance in the field.},

	abstract = {Alternatives to chemicals for controlling dreissenid mussels are desirable for environmental compatibility, but few alternatives exist. Previous studies have evaluated the use of electrified fields for stunning and/or killing planktonic life stages of dreissenid mussels, however, the available literature on the use of electrified fields to control adult dreissenid mussels is limited. We evaluated the effects of sinusoidal alternating current (AC) and 20\% duty cycle square-wave pulsed direct current (PDC) exposure on the survival of adult zebra mussels at water temperatures of 10, 15, and 22 °C. Peak voltage gradients of {\textasciitilde} 17 and 30 Vp/cm in the AC and PDC exposures, respectively, were continuously applied for 24, 48, or 72 h. Peak power densities ranged from 77,999 to 107,199 µW/cm3 in the AC exposures and 245,320 to 313,945 µW/cm3 in the PDC exposures. The peak dose ranged from 6,739 to 27,298 Joules/cm3 and 21,306 to 80,941 Joules/cm3 in the AC and PDC exposures, respectively. The applied power ranged from 16.6 to 68.9 kWh in the AC exposures and from 22.2 to 86.4 kWh in the PDC exposures. Mortality ranged from 2.7 to 92.7\% in the AC exposed groups and from 24.0 to 98.7\% in PDC exposed groups. Mortality increased with corresponding increases in water temperature and exposure duration, and we observed more zebra mussel mortality in the PDC exposures. Exposures conducted with AC required less of a peak dose (Joules/cm3) but more applied power (kWh) to achieve the same level of adult zebra mussel mortality as corresponding PDC exposures. The results demonstrate that 20\% duty cycle square-wave PDC requires less energy than sinusoidal AC to inducing the same level of adult zebra mussel mortality.},

	abstract = {Zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771), an invasive bivalve in North America, was first recorded in Lake Winnipeg in 2013. Quagga mussel D. bugensis (Andrusov, 1897), a second invasive mussel to North America, has yet to be detected in Manitoba waters. The establishment and continued spread of zebra mussels is of concern. Accordingly, we developed two species-specific and one Dreissena-specific qPCR-based environmental DNA (eDNA) assays designed as a single multiplexed reaction able to identify the presence of zebra mussel and infer the presence of quagga mussel in water samples from at-risk and invaded locations. In 2014, samples were collected from four invaded harbours on Lake Winnipeg during the early (May) and late (October) seasons. Zebra mussel eDNA was detected in 0–33.3\% of samples per site early in the season, whereas late season sample detection ranged from 42.9 to 100\%. In order to confirm that there was no non-specific amplification of DNA from local biota, samples were also collected from sites where neither adult nor veliger-stage zebra mussels had been previously observed. These sites included three harbours on Lake Winnipeg and six sites within the Manitoban portion of the Red River. No amplification of eDNA was recorded at these sites except for that at a float-plane dock in the Red River upstream of Lake Winnipeg. Zebra mussels were subsequently detected at this location by sampling for transformed attached individuals. Thus, we demonstrate that eDNA is an early indicator of the presence of zebra mussels and is a useful detection tool at the forefront of their recent invasion in Manitoba. This work provides the foundation for the development of a zebra mussel eDNA monitoring program for waterbodies in Manitoba and western Canada.},

	abstract = {The Bureau of Reclamation has been monitoring the waters in the western U.S. since 2006 for the presence of dreissenid mussels. Currently, Reclamation has evaluated over 17,000 raw water samples representing over 400 western water bodies. This data includes water bodies where mussels had invaded and control methods were being tested. Primarily however, the program tested western waters for the purposes of tracking the dreissenid mussel invasion. Utilizing the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) program for zebra mussel detection, Reclamation developed a protocol for raw water testing for determination of dreissenid mussel presence in western waters that included microscopy and DNA testing. The results of testing clashed with definitions, and triggered concerns for costly false positives that round robin testing did not substantiate. During that time, a clear understanding of the conflicting test results was not available for the stakeholders and partners participating in the mussel detection program. The large body of data revealed some unique information on the invasion of mussels in the western US; from the way samples were collected and preserved, to the slower than anticipated spread. The Reclamation Detection Laboratory for Exotic Species (RDLES) conducted research looking more closely at the science involved in the detection of invasive mussels in raw water plankton tow net samples. As research revealed information about the lack of microscopic findings, the value of environmental DNA (eDNA) findings for invasive species and mission essential projects became apparent. This article will present an overview of the Reclamation invasive mussel program detection, monitoring, and briefing on some control research activities. RDLES research developments have far-reaching applications for future management activities and decisions with many lessons learned about planktonic sampling from this large body of data and the related discovery of benefits of eDNA testing for numerous species of concern.},

The second experiment tested settlement after exposure to 100 mJ/cm², and examined veligers behavior and direct mortality post exposure to UV doses of 100, 50, 40 and 20 mJ/cm². All doses tested in the first experiment resulted in settlement reduction between 88 and 99\%. The 100 mJ/cm² dose reduced settlement by 99\%.

	abstract = {The golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei, is an epibenthic mytilid native to freshwaters of China and south-eastern Asia. It became established in Hong Kong in 1965, in Japan in the 1990’s and South America in 1991 through ballast water discharge into the La Plata River basin in Argentina. It has since expanded to Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Brazil in South America. Populations have steadily increased in these countries since their first reported incidence. The golden mussel is not yet present in North America. A Risk Assessment of golden mussel for the Province of Ontario, Canada was performed using a four step process, developed by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry: While the potential impacts of an invasion of golden mussel in the Great Lakes has been well documented, the likelihood of a wide spread invasion (i.e., the likelihood of arrival, survival, establishment and spread) was further investigated. Uncertainty for each of the four stages of invasion was also estimated. The risk assessment ranked ballast water exchange of Atlantic transoceanic vessels from South America as the primary potential pathway for introduction of golden mussel directly into the Great Lakes. A “back door” entry into the Great Lakes was also considered via overland dispersal (e.g. trailered boats) following a ballast water exchange introduction by transoceanic vessels from Asia to the Pacific coast of North America. However, the overall probability of arrival through these two pathways was ranked low. The probability of survival, establishment, and spread of golden mussel in Ontario was deemed to be low, primarily because of its physiological intolerance of cold, winter waters. The level of uncertainty was considered moderate as there has been no golden mussel invasion reported from lakes that freeze over in Asia or South America for at least two months. Based on the current distribution of golden mussel being limited mostly to waters with minimum temperatures of 10 °C to 12 °C at 36º latitude, the Climatch analysis, and the number of degree days required for reproduction and establishment, the level of risk for invasion into Ontario waters is low and the level of uncertainty is moderate. This would likely apply to all of Canada and most of the USA north of the 36th parallel that is covered by snow or where lakes have ice cover for at least two months of the year. An analysis of the impact of climate change on golden mussel in Ontario suggests that summer temperatures in Lake Erie could rise to levels that would support reproduction and establishment by 2040. However, the lowest temperature reported to support establishment of mussels is 5 °C and it is estimated it would likely take more than 200 years to reach and maintain this temperature in Lake Erie.},

	abstract = {The 24 hour activity patterns of three non-native gobiids (round goby Neogobius melanostomus, Western tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris and bighead goby Ponticola kessleri) were assessed over 46 consecutive months between 2011 and 2014 from their occurrence in the cooling water intake of a nuclear power plant on the River Rhine, Germany. In total, 117717 gobiids were identified and classified. The occurrence of all three species varied strongly between sampling years, and species-specific activity triggers were identified. The activity of juveniles of all three gobiids species was positively temperature dependent while adult tubenose goby activity appeared to be negatively temperature dependent. Increasing fluvial discharge in the adjoining main river stimulated the activity of juvenile round goby but inhibited activity of adult tubenose goby. Except for adult bighead goby, activity was also structured by time of day, but with no uniform mean. Meteorological factors such as precipitation, air pressure and duration of sunshine hours had little or no influence on gobiid activity. On selected rare occasions, mainly at night, all three species exhibited pulsed swarming behaviour, with thousands of individuals recorded in the intake water. Round goby swarms exhibited both the highest intensity and the largest swarming individuals, suggesting a potential competitive advantage over tubenose and bighead goby. Electric fishing surveys in natural river stretches corroborated this observation. Negative effects on the native fish fauna were apparent only for the bullhead, Cottus gobio.
The activity triggers identified offer a unique insight into the invasion mechanisms of these ecosystem-changing non-native gobiids.},

	abstract = {Efficient management and prevention of species invasions requires accurate prediction of where species of concern can arrive and persist. Species distribution models provide one way to identify potentially suitable habitat by developing the relationship between climate variables and species occurrence data. However, these models when applied to freshwater invasions are complicated by two factors. The first is that the range expansions that typically occur as part of the invasion process violate standard species distribution model assumptions of data stationarity. Second, predicting potential range of freshwater aquatic species is complicated by the reliance on terrestrial climate measurements to develop occurrence relationships for species that occur in aquatic environments. To overcome these obstacles, we combined a recently developed algorithm for species distribution modeling—range bagging—with newly available aquatic habitat-specific information from the North American Great Lakes region to predict suitable habitat for three potential invasive species: golden mussel, killer shrimp, and northern snakehead. Range bagging may more accurately predict relative suitability than other methods because it focuses on the limits of the species environmental tolerances rather than central tendency or “typical” cases. Overlaying the species distribution model output with aquatic habitat-specific data then allowed for more specific predictions of areas with high suitability. Our results indicate there is suitable habitat for northern snakehead in the Great Lakes, particularly shallow coastal habitats in the lower four Great Lakes where literature suggests they will favor areas of wetland and submerged aquatic vegetation. These coastal areas also offer the highest suitability for golden mussel, but our models suggest they are marginal habitats. Globally, the Great Lakes provide the closest match to the currently invaded range of killer shrimp, but they appear to pose an intermediate risk to the region. Range bagging provided reliable predictions when assessed either by a standard test set or by tests for spatial transferability, with golden mussel being the most difficult to accurately predict. Our approach illustrates the strength of combining multiple sources of data, while reiterating the need for increased measurement of freshwater habitat at high spatial resolutions to improve the ability to predict potential invasive species.},

	abstract = {In 2004, Mytella charruana (d'Orbigny, 1842) (Mollusca: Bivalvia: Mytilidae) became established along the coast of the southeastern United States (SE-US). Using mitochondrial DNA sequencing (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I), we compared genetic variation throughout its native range in South America to its invasive range in the SE-US. Samples from the SE-US were collected in 2006 and 2010 enabling a temporal comparison to evaluate possible genetic changes of the invasive population. We addressed two questions. First, what are the potential source populations (or geographic regions) for the SE-US invasion? Second, how has genetic diversity changed between the two sampling periods within the SE-US? We identified a total of 72 haplotypes, 64 of which were isolated to geographic sites and only 8 were shared among sites. The highly structured native range provides insight into the origin of invasive populations where our results suggest that the introduced SE-US population originated from multiple source populations with the Panama region as the primary source. Additionally, our results indicate that genetic composition of the non-native populations was unchanged between the two sampling periods. Mytella charruana exhibit a significant pattern of genetic structure among natural populations, owing to biogeographic barriers that limit natural dispersal, and an ability to persist in novel habitats, owing to a suite of life-history characters that favor survival under variable conditions. Overall, this study explains why M. charruana may become an increasing threat to locations founded by anthropogenic transportation.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien species (IAS) are species whose introduction or spread outside their native range threatens biological diversity, ecosystem functioning, economy, and/or public health. The recent European Union (EU) regulation on the management of IAS emphasizes the need for a consistent approach to alien species assessment that will underpin international measures for the early identification of newly introduced IAS followed by rapid action aimed at the prevention of introduction, spread, and negative impacts. The goals of the present study were (1) to present the risk classifications of 18 aquatic alien species for The Netherlands using the Invasive Species Environmental Impact Assessment protocol, (2) to compare these with available risk classifications made for countries spanning similar climatic and biogeographical regions to the EU, and (3) to provide explanations for inconsistencies between different risk classifications. Five species were classified as high risk: Carassius gibelio (Prussian carp), Cyprinus carpio (common carp), Sander lucioperca (pike‐perch), Cabomba caroliniana (fanwort), and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (quagga mussel). Of the 14 species with existing risk classifications for countries spanning similar climatic and biogeographical regions to the EU, all but two of the assessed species (C. gibelio and D. rostriformis bugensis) were classified inconsistently. Reasons for these inconsistencies are the application of different risk assessment schemes, application on a national rather than biogeographical scale, differences in the definition and application of criteria, differences in habitat availability, and uncertainties that are intrinsic to risk assessment methodologies. Approaches that increase transparency by highlighting these methodological aspects, normative choices, and uncertainties are vital to the legitimacy of any risk assessment method and will increase acceptance among decision makers, nature managers, and stakeholders.},

	abstract = {Artificial reefs created by deliberately sinking ships off the coast of the Florida Keys island chain are providing new habitat for marine invertebrates. This newly developing fouling community includes the previously reported invasive orange tube coral Tubastraea coccinea and the non-native giant foam oyster Hyotissa hyotis. New SCUBA-based surveys involving five shipwrecks spanning the upper, middle, and lower Florida Keys, show T. coccinea now also established in the lower Keys and H. hyotis likewise extending to new sites. Two additional mollusks found on the artificial reefs, the amathinid gastropod Cyclothyca pacei and gryphaeid oyster Hyotissa mcgintyi, the latter also common in the natural reef areas, are discussed as potentially non-native. A new species of sessile, suspension-feeding, worm-snail, Thylacodes vandyensis Bieler, Rawlings \& Collins n. sp. (Vermetidae), is described from the wreck of the USNS Vandenberg off Key West and discussed as potentially invasive. This new species is compared morphologically and by DNA barcode markers to other known members of the genus, and may be a recent arrival from the Pacific Ocean. Thylacodes vandyensis is polychromatic, with individuals varying in both overall head-foot coloration and mantle margin color pattern. Females brood stalked egg capsules attached to their shell within the confines of their mantle cavity, and give rise to crawl-away juveniles. Such direct-developing species have the demonstrated capacity for colonizing habitats isolated far from their native ranges and establishing rapidly growing founder populations. Vermetid gastropods are common components of the marine fouling community in warm temperate and tropical waters and, as such, have been tagged as potentially invasive or with a high potential to be invasive in the Pacific Ocean. As vermetids can influence coral growth/composition in the Pacific and have been reported serving as intermediate hosts for blood flukes of loggerhead turtles, such new arrivals in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary are of concern. Growing evidence indicates that artificial reefs can act as permanent way-stations for arriving non-natives, providing nurseries within which populations may grow in an environment with reduced competition compared to native habitats. Consequently, artificial reefs can act as sentinels for the appearance of new species.

	abstract = {Overland transport of recreational boats is among the most important distribution vectors for aquatic invasive zebra and quagga mussels between inland waters. Simple measures such as instructing boat owners how to prepare their boat for transport so that the boat does not carry invasive species are considered to be important prevention measures. Nevertheless, the net effects of such measures are poorly understood and the boat cleaning behavior of boat owners has never been studied in detail before the implementation of such preventive measures. Using a “self-report” questionnaire, we investigated the boat cleaning behavior of boat owners in Switzerland where almost no preventive measures have been taken yet. We found that the self-reported boat cleaning rates are high, with 92\% of boaters cleaning their boat upon finding mussels attached to their boat and 84\% of them cleaning their boat before a transport. Nevertheless, only half of the boat owners report using high pressure washing to clean their boat before overland transport and many use ineffective cleaning methods. We show the importance of informing boat owners on the appropriate methods to remove invasive species from their boat and suggest that high pressure washing facilities should be made available at all potentially infested water bodies. Furthermore, our analysis shows that the boat cleaning behavior could be significantly improved by changing how boat owners value the perceived costs and benefits of cleaning, as well as by increasing their awareness of the potential negative impacts on aquatic ecosystems caused by non-native species. With regard to a possible spread of zebra mussels to uninfested alpine lakes and the imminent spread of quagga mussels in Switzerland, we conclude that the Swiss boating community would be open to accepting implementation of prevention measures.},

In the early stages of invasion, aquatic invasive species are typically rare and their detection using costly and time-consuming field surveys is often challenging. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods are increasingly applied in freshwater systems to detect and quantify target species with relative ease over large geographic scales and across the invasion fronts. In this study we test eDNA detection and quantification methods for invasive zebra and quagga mussels. Both mussel species have invaded widely in North America and Europe and show strong negative ecosystem-wide impacts. We extracted DNA from filtered water samples which we collected along the Rhine catchment in Switzerland, Germany and The Netherlands, including the known invasion area of the zebra mussel and the invasion front of the quagga mussel. Standard PCR and quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods were compared for detection and qPCR was used to quantify the eDNA signal for each species. Our results show that the invasion front of the quagga mussel has moved southwards, including areas where this species had not been detected previously with traditional benthic invertebrate sampling methods. Standard PCR and qPCR showed a similar performance in detecting both mussel species. Moreover, the eDNA quantification of the two species showed low variance within sampling site and matched with expected densities of zebra and quagga mussels based on previous field survey studies. The tested eDNA methods are cost effective and have the potential to be widely applied for the surveillance of zebra and quagga mussels in the future.},

Such models are relatively ``theory-free''. In contrast, theories for explaining species' distributions draw on concepts like fitness, niche, and environmental suitability. This paper proposes that environmental suitability be defined as the conditional probability of occurrence of a species given the state of the environment at a location. Any quantity that is proportional to this probability is a measure of relative suitability and the support of this probability is the niche. This formulation suggests new methods for presence-background modeling of species distributions that unify statistical methodology with the conceptual framework of niche theory. One method, the plug-and-play approach, is introduced for the first time. Variations on the plug-and-play approach were studied with respect to their numerical performance on 106 species from an exhaustively sampled presence/absence survey of vegetation in the Canton of Vaud, Switzerland. Additionally, we looked at the robustness of these methods to the presence of irrelevant information and sample size. Although irrelevant variables eroded the predictive performance of all methods, these methods were found to be both numerically and statistically robust.},

	abstract = {Ce projet de maîtrise fait partie du programme stratégique du CRSNG « Interactions entre la pollution et les changements climatiques (IPOC) ». Les modèles animaux utilisés dans ce projet comme organismes sentinelles sont les moules dreissenidae (Dreissena polymorpha et Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) en eau douce et les moules bleues (Mytilus edulis) en eau marine. La zone d’étude s’étend des Grands Lacs au golfe du Saint-Laurent et comprend un site dans l’arctique canadien. Les objectifs du projet étaient : 1) le développement analytique permettant la préparation d’échantillon pour des analyses simultanées pour les BPC, les HAP et les PBDE en vue d’un dosage par GC-EIHRMS; 2) La comparaison inter-sites des teneurs accumulées chez les moules en BPC, HAP et PBDE et de leurs compositions relatives; 3). Évaluer le potentiel de bioaccumulation à partir des sédiments de surface et; 4) Évaluer les différences d’accumulation entre les deux espèces de dreissènes retrouvées en eau douce (D. polymorpha/D. rostriformis bugensis) et en fonction de la taille en eau douce et en eau marine.Le projet a permis le développement d’une méthodologie d’analyse chimique. La validation méthodologique a montré des recouvrements obtenus près de 100 \% avec des écarts-types inférieurs à 10 \% et des pourcentages de recouvrement des étalons internes d’environ 70 \% avec des écarts-types situés entre 5 et 15 \%. Les limites de détection de méthode calculées (LDM) varient et sont d’environ 0,05 μg/kg pour les BPC, 0,2 μg/kg pour les HAP et les PBDE et de 1 ng/kg pour les PCDD/F. L’exactitude a été évaluée pour les BPC et les PCDD/F avec un matériau de référence certifié fourni par le Conseil national de recherches Canada (CNRC), la conformité des valeurs étant atteinte et l’absence de différence significative entre cette méthodologie et celle au Soxhlet.Quant aux moules, leur utilisation et la caractérisation des teneurs accumulées en BPC, PBDE et HAP ont permis d’évaluer les similarités et différences probables de sources de contamination anthropogéniques à travers les sites évalués. Les facteurs de bioaccumulation (BSAF) ont été évalués pour ces trois espèces à partir des sédiments de surface pour les BPC, les HAP et les PBDE pour les sites prélevés, les facteurs de bioaccumulation étant plus élevés pour Mytilus edulis que pour les dreissenidae, bien que les niveaux retrouvés en eau douce soient considérablement plus élevés. Les différences de composition pour les BPC, les HAP et les PBDE entre les sédiments de surface ont aussi été étudiées et discutées. Les résultats ont montré de la bioaccumulation plus élevée chez la moule quagga (Dreissena rostrifomis bugensis) que les moules zébrées (Dreissena polymorpha) pour les BPC et les PBDE, et qu’il n’y avait pas de différence pour les HAP. L’effet de la taille a aussi été évalué sur les facteurs de bioaccumulation pour les moules dreissenidae et les résultats ne semblent pas montrer d’effet de la taille sur le potentiel de bioaccumulation. Enfin, la bioaccumulation chez les moules invasives en eau douce semble être fortement influencés par le stade de reproduction, la période après la ponte étant marqué par une baisse significative des teneurs accumulées, alors que ce semble moins marqué chez la moule bleue.Alternate abstract:You are viewing a machine translation of selected content from our databases.

Hide full disclaimerThis master's project is part of the NSERC strategic program "Interactions between Pollution and Climate Change (IPOC)". The animal models used in this project as sentinel organisms are dreissenid mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) in fresh water and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in marine water. The study area extends from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and includes a site in the Canadian Arctic. The objectives of the project were: 1) analytical development allowing sample preparation for simultaneous analyzes for PCBs, PAHs and PBDEs for assay by GC-EIHRMS; 2) Inter-site comparison of accumulated PCB, PAH and PBDE levels in mussels and their relative compositions; 3). Assess the potential for bioaccumulation from surface sediments and; 4) Evaluate the differences in accumulation between the two species of dreissenes found in fresh water (D. polymorpha/D. rostriformis bugensis) and according to size in fresh water and in marine water.The project enabled the development of a chemical analysis methodology. The methodological validation showed recoveries obtained close to 100\% with standard deviations of less than 10\% and recovery percentages of internal standards of around 70\% with standard deviations between 5 and 15\%. Calculated method detection limits (MDLs) vary and are approximately 0.05 μg/kg for PCBs, 0.2 μg/kg for PAHs and PBDEs, and 1 ng/kg for PCDD/Fs. Accuracy was assessed for PCBs and PCDD/Fs with a certified reference material provided by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), with compliance values achieved and no significant difference between this methodology and that at the Soxhlet.As for the mussels, their use and the characterization of the accumulated levels of PCBs, PBDEs and PAHs made it possible to assess the similarities and probable differences of sources of anthropogenic contamination across the sites assessed. The bioaccumulation factors (BSAF) were evaluated for these three species from surface sediments for PCBs, PAHs and PBDEs for the sites sampled, the bioaccumulation factors being higher for Mytilus edulis than for the dreissenidae, although that the levels found in fresh water are considerably higher. Compositional differences for PCBs, PAHs and PBDEs between surficial sediments were also investigated and discussed. The results showed higher bioaccumulation in quagga mussels (Dreissena rostrifomis bugensis) than zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) for PCBs and PBDEs, and that there was no difference for PAHs. The effect of size was also evaluated on bioaccumulation factors for dreissenid mussels and the results do not seem to show any effect of size on bioaccumulation potential. Finally, bioaccumulation in invasive freshwater mussels seems to be strongly influenced by the stage of reproduction, the period after spawning being marked by a significant drop in accumulated levels, whereas this seems less marked in blue mussels.},

	abstract = {Vectors that underpin the natural dispersal of invasive alien species are frequently unknown. In particular, the passive dispersal (zoochory) of one organism (or propagule) by another, usually more mobile animal, remains poorly understood. Field observations of the adherence of invasive freshwater bivalves to other organisms have prompted us to assess the importance of zoochory in the spread of three prolific invaders: zebra mussel Dreissena polymorpha; quagga mussel Dreissena bugensis; and Asian clam Corbicula fluminea. An extensive, systematic search of the literature was conducted across multiple on-line scientific databases using various search terms and associated synonyms. In total, only five publications fully satisfied the search criteria. It appears that some fish species can internally transport viable adult D. polymorpha and C. fluminea specimens. Additionally, literature indicates that veligers and juvenile D. polymorpha can adhere to the external surfaces of waterbirds. Overall, literature suggests that zoochorous dispersal of invasive bivalves is possible, but likely a rare occurrence. However, even the establishment of a few individuals (or a single self-fertilising C. fluminea specimen) can, over-time, result in a substantial population. Here, we highlight knowledge gaps, identify realistic opportunities for data collection, and suggest management protocols to mitigate the spread of invasive alien species.
Les vecteurs qui sous-tendent la dispersion naturelle des espèces exotiques envahissantes sont souvent inconnus. En particulier, la dispersion passive (zoochorie) d'un organisme (ou propagule) par un autre, habituellement plus mobile, reste mal comprise. Les observations sur le terrain de l'adhésion des bivalves d'eau douce envahissants à d'autres organismes nous ont incité à évaluer l'importance de la zoochorie dans la propagation de trois envahisseurs prolifiques  : la moule zébrée Dreissena polymorpha ; Moule Quagga Dreissena bugensis ; et la palourde asiatique Corbicula fluminea. Une recherche approfondie et systématique de la littérature a été menée dans de multiples bases de données scientifiques en ligne utilisant différents termes de recherche et synonymes associés. Au total, seulement cinq publications ont pleinement satisfait les critères de recherche. Il semble que certaines espèces de poissons puissent transporter intérieurement des spécimens adultes viables de D. polymorpha et C. fluminea. En outre, la littérature indique que les véligères et les D. polymorpha juvéniles peuvent adhérer aux surfaces externes des oiseaux d'eau. Dans l'ensemble, la littérature suggère que la dispersion par zoochorie des bivalves invasifs est possible, mais probablement une occurrence rare. Cependant, même l'établissement de quelques individus (ou un seul spécimen autofécondant de C. fluminea) peut, au fil du temps, entraîner une population importante.

One approach to improve forecasts of how global change will affect ecosystem processes is to better understand how anthropogenic disturbances alter bacterial assemblages that drive biogeochemical cycles. Species invasions are important contributors to global change, but their impacts on bacterial community ecology are rarely investigated. Here, we studied direct impacts of invasive dreissenid mussels (IDMs), one of many invasive filter feeders, on freshwater lake bacterioplankton. We demonstrated that direct effects of IDMs reduced bacterial abundance and altered assemblage composition by preferentially removing larger and particle-associated bacteria. While this increased the relative abundances of many free-living bacterial taxa, some were susceptible to filter feeding, in line with efficient removal of phytoplankton cells of {\textless}2 μm. This selective removal of particle-associated and larger bacteria by IDMs altered inferred bacterial functional group representation, defined by carbon and energy source utilization. Specifically, we inferred an increased relative abundance of chemoorganoheterotrophs predicted to be capable of rhodopsin-dependent energy generation. In contrast to the few previous studies that have focused on the longer-term combined direct and indirect effects of IDMs on bacterioplankton, our study showed that IDMs act directly as a biological disturbance to which freshwater bacterial assemblages are sensitive. The negative impacts on particle-associated bacteria, which have been shown to be more active than free-living bacteria, and the inferred shifts in functional group representation raise the possibility that IDMs may directly alter bacterially mediated ecosystem functions.
IMPORTANCE Freshwater bacteria play fundamental roles in global elemental cycling and are an intrinsic part of local food webs. Human activities are altering freshwater environments, and much has been learned regarding the sensitivity of bacterial assemblages to a variety of these disturbances. Yet, relatively few studies have focused on how species invasion, which is one of the most important aspects of anthropogenic global change, affects freshwater bacterial assemblages. This study focuses on the impact of invasive dreissenid mussels (IDMs), a globally distributed group of invasive species with large impacts on freshwater phyto- and zooplankton assemblages. We show that IDMs have direct effects on lake bacterioplankton abundance, taxonomic composition, and inferred bacterial functional group representation.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is one of the main challenges affecting the globe, with particular implications for the oceans. Marine climate change research has moved forward rapidly in recent years, and a range of physical model outputs are available that can be used by ecologists to help predict how species might be affected into the future. Policy makers require a level of understanding of how certain species and their ranges might change so that they can respond with sustainable management actions. This thesis aims to make use of a number of modelling techniques to explore implications of past and future conditions for marine species, and to appraise those tools that can be used under differing circumstances. Policy questions are answered relating to changes in the abundance and distribution of marine species. The links between historical climatic conditions and Barents Sea cod abundance are explored using Generalised Additive Models using data collected in the middle of the 20th century. This valuable historical data indicated that cod have temperature preferences and expand and shift their distributions based on environmental conditions. A simpler modelling technique is used to examine how oxygen conditions have changed in recent decades in the North Sea, how they might change in the future, and what implications this has for commercial fish species. The models show that oxygen conditions have improved recently and that they will not decrease to levels that result in large negative effects in the coming century. Species distribution modelling using a combination of global and downscaled model outputs shows that the UK will become more suitable for some non-native and harmful algal species in the 21st century, and less suitable for others. The model outputs contribute to the understanding of climate change effects and development of management tools to ensure the resilience of marine ecosystems into the future.},

	abstract = {The Laurentian Great Lakes have experienced unprecedented ecological and environmental changes, especially after the introduction of invasive quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis). While impacts on ecological functions have been widely recognized, the response of carbon dynamics to invasive species remains largely unknown. We report new CO2 data showing significant increases in pCO2 (up to 800 μatm in Lake Michigan) and CO2 emission fluxes in most of the Great Lakes compared to those prior to or during the early stage of the colonization of invasive quagga mussels. The increased CO2 supersaturation is most prominent in Lakes Huron and Michigan, followed by Lakes Ontario and Erie, but no evident change was observed in Lake Superior. This trend mirrors the infestation extent of invasive quagga mussels in the Great Lakes and is consistent with the decline in primary production and increase in water clarity observed pre- and post-Dreissena introduction, revealing a close linkage between invasive species and carbon dynamics. The Great Lakes have become a significant CO2 source to the atmosphere, emitting {\textgreater}7.7 ± 1.0 Tg-C annually, which is higher than the organic carbon burial rate in global inland-seas and attesting to the significant role of the Laurentian Great Lakes in regional/global CO2 budget and cycling.},

	abstract = {Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) are known to increase water clarity and affect ecosystem processes in invaded lakes. During the last decade, the conspecific quagga mussels (D. rostriformis bugensis) have displaced zebra mussels in many ecosystems including shallow lakes such as Oneida Lake, New York. In this study, an eight-week mesocosm experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that the displacement of zebra mussels by quagga mussels leads to further decreases in phytoplankton and increases in water clarity resulting in increases in benthic algae. We found that the presence of zebra mussels alone (ZM), quagga mussels alone (QM), or an equal number of both species (ZQ) reduced total phosphorus (TP) and phytoplankton Chl a. Total suspended solids (TSS) was reduced in ZM and ZQ treatments. Light intensity at the sediment surface was higher in all three mussel treatments than in the no-mussel controls but there was no difference among the mussel treatments. There was no increase in benthic algae biomass in the mussel treatments compared with the no-mussel controls. Importantly, there was no significant difference in nutrient (TP, soluble reactive phosphorus and NO3-) levels, TSS, phytoplankton Chl a, benthic algal Chl a, or light intensity on the sediment surface between ZM, QM and ZQ treatments. These results confirm the strong effect of both mussel species on water clarity and indicate that the displacement of zebra mussel by an equivalent biomass of quagga mussel is not likely to lead to further increases in water clarity, at least for the limnological conditions, including summer temperature, tested in this experiment.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.2672},
	abstract = {Aggregations of the Ponto-Caspian invasive zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) constitute a suitable habitat for macroinvertebrates, considerably increasing their abundance and providing effective antipredator protection. Thus, the overall effect of a mussel bed on particular predator species may vary from positive to negative, depending on both prey density increase and predator ability to prey in a structurally complex habitat. Alien Ponto-Caspian goby fish are likely to be facilitated when introduced into new areas by zebra mussels, provided that they are capable of utilizing mussel beds as habitat and feeding grounds. We ran laboratory experiments to find which prey (chironomid larvae) densities (from ca. 500 to 2,000 individuals m−2) in a mussel bed make it a more beneficial feeding ground for the racer goby Babka gymnotrachelus (RG) and western tubenose goby Proterorhinus semilunaris (WTG) compared to sandy and stone substrata (containing the basic prey density of 500 ind. m−2). Moreover, we checked how food availability affects habitat selection by fish. Mussel beds became more suitable for fish than alternative mineral substrata when food abundance was at least two times higher (1,000 vs. 500 ind. m−2), regardless of fish size and species. WTG was associated with mussel beds regardless of its size and prey density, whereas RG switched to this habitat when it became a better feeding ground than alternative substrata. Larger RG exhibited a stronger affinity for mussels than small individuals. WTG fed more efficiently from a mussel bed at high food abundances than RG. A literature review has shown that increasing chironomid density, which in our study was sufficient to make a mussel habitat an attractive feeding ground for the gobies, is commonly observed in mussel beds in the field. Therefore, we conclude that zebra mussels may positively affect the alien goby species and are likely to facilitate their establishment in novel areas, contributing to an invasional meltdown in the Ponto-Caspian invasive community.},

	abstract = {Invasive non-native species are widespread in freshwaters but their capacity to establish in new lakes has seldom been assessed. In this four-year study (2006–2009), we used Side-scan Sonar and underwater video to illustrate how a 200 ha urban, amenity lake at Cardiff Bay (Wales, UK) was invaded extensively by zebra mussels Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas) within 2–3 years of creation in 2001. Veliger surveys and artificial substrates were used to assess conditions affecting juvenile settlement. Within 5–8 years of lake formation, all hard substrates at 0.5–7 m held mussel densities of 250–6600 m-2 which, coupled with a crude estimate of habitat available, suggested a lake-wide population of at least 9–31 million adults. Veligers reached 8 (± 2 SE) to 14 (± 4) L-1 during May–September when water temperatures were {\textgreater}14 °C, but densities and juvenile settlement declined at high discharge when lake flushing rates increased: settled densities in a drier year (2007) exceeded those in a wet year (2008) by 120× implying more effective colonisation under low flows and longer residence times. These data illustrate how rapid invasion by non-native species should be appropriately factored into planning and risk assessments for new water bodies, and potential effects on amenity, ecosystem processes and ecosystem services considered. Our data suggest that drought and low flow under future climates could be a particular risk factor affecting Dreissena colonisation.},

	abstract = {The discovery of quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis) in Lake Mead in 2007 was the catalyst for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to train their canines to detect adult quagga mussels by scent. The use of specialized detection dogs has increased the effectiveness of watercraft inspections and helped prevent further infestations by this invasive species. Since these canines are currently being utilized to detect adult and juvenile quagga mussels, we investigated if canines can detect the veliger larvae stage, as the transportation of larva via watercraft remains a potential pathway of introduction. Although the canines were already imprinted for adult quagga mussels, in which an odor is associated with reward, they required further training to reliably detect veliger larvae populations. Over the course of a 3-day study the canines’ detection rates became more sensitive as familiarity with the veliger odor training progressed. For the lowest concentration blind trial (31 veligers per jar), all canines used in the experiment were able to correctly identify samples with veligers larvae after training.},

Biodiversity protection is a major target of the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive, requiring assessment of the status of biodiversity on the level of species, habitats, and ecosystems including genetic diversity and the role of biodiversity in food web functioning and structure. This paper provides a summary of the development of new indicators and refinement of existing ones in order to address some of the observed gaps in indicator availability for marine biodiversity assessments considering genetic, species, habitat, and ecosystem levels. Promising new indicators are available addressing genetic diversity of microbial and benthic communities. Novel indicators to assess biodiversity and food webs associated with habitats formed by keystone species (such as macroalgae) as well as to map benthic habitats (such as biogenic reefs) using high resolution habitat characterization were developed. We also discuss the advances made on indicators for detecting impacts of non-native invasive species and assessing the structure and functioning of marine food-webs. The latter are based on indicators showing the effects of fishing on trophic level and size distribution of fish and elasmobranch communities well as phytoplankton and zooplankton community structure as food web indicators. New and refined indicators are ranked based on quality criteria). Their applicability for various EU and global biodiversity assessments and the need for further development of new indicators and refinement of the existing ones is discussed.},

D. rostiformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1897) that have limited effect on non-target species. Applications of low concentrations of potassium salt (as potash) have shown promise for use where the infestation and treatment can be contained or isolated. To further our understanding of such applications and obtain data that could support a pesticide registration, we conducted studies of the acute and chronic toxicity of potassium chloride to dreissenid mussels in four different water sources from infested and non-infested locations (ground water from northern Idaho, surface water from the Snake River, Idaho, USA, surface water from Lake Ontario, Ontario, Canada, and surface water from the Colorado River, Arizona, USA). We found short term exposure of veligers ({\textless} 24 h) to concentrations of 960 mg/L KCl produced rapid mortality in water from three locations, but veligers tested in Colorado River water were resistant. We used probit models to compare the mortality responses, predicted median lethal times and 95\% confidence intervals. In separate experiments, we explored the sensitivity of byssal stage mussels in chronic exposures ({\textgreater}29 d) at concentrations of 100 and 200 mg/L KCl. Rapid mortality occurred within 10 d of exposure to concentrations of 200 mg/L KCl, regardless of water source. Kaplan-Meier estimates of mean survival of byssal mussels in 100 mg/L KCl prepared in surface water from Idaho and Lake Ontario were 4.9 or 6.9 d, respectively; however, mean survival of mussels tested in the Colorado River water was {\textgreater} 23 d. The sodium content of the Colorado River water was nearly three times that measured in waters from the other locations, and we hypothesized sodium concentrations may affect mussel survival. To test our hypothesis, we supplemented Snake River and Lake Ontario water with NaCl to equivalent conductivity as the Colorado River, and found mussel survival increased to levels observed in tests of veliger and byssal mussels in Colorado River water. We recommend KCl disinfection and eradication protocols must be developed to carefully consider the water quality characteristics of treatment locations.},

The relatively arbitrary nature of terms such as "native" and "non-native", and the rather inconsistent ways in which such terms are applied to biological species, as well as the subjective boundaries of so-called "native ranges" are analyzed. The role of non-native species in their new environments can be considerably more complex than the anti-introduced species information would often suggest.

	abstract = {Biological invasions are commonly observed in both the natural habitats and those which are altered by human activities. An understanding of the mechanisms involved in the successful introduction, establishment and invasion of exotic taxa is essential in predicting of changes in biodiversity and community structure. Symbiont-mediated interactions between exotic and native hosts are of special interest due to the indirect effects on population dynamics. The aim of this study was to estimate the presence of symbionts in Chinese pond mussel Sinanodonta woodiana (Lea, 1834), an exotic species of mussel in European fresh waters. The number of 340 individuals of S. woodiana was collected from Polish water bodies, including thermally heated lakes and fish ponds with natural thermal regime. The examination of mussels revealed the presence of Rhipidocotyle campanula sporocysts and cercariae (Digenea: Bucephalidae), water mites Unionicola ypsilophora (Acari: Hydracarina), oligochaetes Chaetogaster limnaei limnaei (Oligochaeta: Naididae) and chironomids Glyptotendipes sp. (Diptera: Chironomidae). The global prevalence of mussels inhabited by Ch. limnaei limnaei was 7.6\%, by water mites and chironomids 3.5\%, and by R. campanula cercariae 2.0\%. The significant difference in the number of mussels with symbionts was identified between heated lakes and fish ponds (χ2=4.15; df=1, P=0.04), with a higher global prevalence of mussels in fish ponds (22.3\%) compared to heated lakes (13.7\%). R. campanula or U. ypsilophora were only found in mussels collected from thermally polluted lakes or fish ponds, respectively. Chironomid larvae and oligochaetes occurred in both types of water bodies. However, Glyptotendipes sp. inhabited mussels with a higher global prevalence in fish ponds than in thermally polluted lakes, while Ch. limnaei limnaei was observed mainly in hosts from heated lakes, and only from one fish pond that were not drained. Our findings indicate that the alien Chinese pond mussel S. woodiana can be inhabited by different groups of symbionts native to Europe, including digenetic trematodes. The results show that S. woodiana can affect directly and indirectly water habitats and the vulnerability of infection with symbionts depends on ecosystem conditions. It occurs that even considerable climate differences do not pose a barrier for exotic mussels to spread.},

However, environmental stress gradients may directly or indirectly decrease individual performance, such that the precise process delimiting a species range may not be revealed simply by studying abundance patterns. In the intertidal habitat the vertical ranges of marine species may be constrained by their abilities to tolerate thermal and desiccation stress, which may act directly or indirectly, the latter by limiting the availability of preferred trophic resources. Therefore, we expected individuals at greater shore heights to show greater variation in diet alongside lower indices of physiological condition. 
Methods: We sampled the grazing gastropod Echinolittorina peruviana from the desert coastline of northern Chile at three shore heights, across eighteen regionally-representative shores. Stable isotope values (δ13C and δ15N) were extracted from E. peruviana and its putative food resources to estimate Bayesian ellipse area, carbon and nitrogen ranges and diet. Individual physiological condition was tracked by muscle \% C and \% N.
Results: There was an increase in isotopic variation at high shore levels, where E. peruviana’s preferred resource, tide-deposited particulate organic matter (POM), appeared to decrease in dietary contribution, and was expected to be less abundant. Both muscle \% C and \% N of individuals decreased with height on the shore.
Discussion: Individuals at higher stress levels appear to be less discriminating in diet, likely because of abiotic forcing, which decreases both consumer mobility and the availability of a preferred resource. Abiotic stress might be expected to increase trophic variation in other selective dietary generalist species. Where this coincides with a lower physiological condition may be a direct factor in setting their range limit.},

	abstract = {Invasive species have substantial impacts across the globe. While management efforts should aim to minimize undesirable impacts, we have a poor understanding of how impacts of a given invasive species vary spatially. Here, we develop a framework for considering heterogeneity of invasive species impacts that allows us to explore the range of possible spatial patterns of impact. This framework incorporates two factors—how invasive species abundance varies among sites (i.e., abundance distributions) and how invasive species impact varies as a function of abundance (i.e., abundance–impact curves). Combining these two factors allows for the creation of probability distributions that represent how invasive species impacts may vary spatially among sites. We used published abundance distributions and inferred abundance–impact curves to generate impact distributions for two problematic invasive species—zebra mussel and Eurasian watermilfoil—across lakes in Wisconsin, USA. Impact distributions of these species tended to be right‐skewed (i.e., the majority of sites had low impacts), although the tail thickness varied. We also simulated how a broader range of combinations of invasive species abundance distributions and abundance–impact curves produce different patterns of invasive species impact. These simulations illustrate a remarkable diversity of invasive species spatial impact patterns—probability distributions of impact were left‐skewed, right‐skewed, bimodal, and normal. Total landscape‐level impacts, estimated by summing site‐level impacts, were similarly variable depending on the distribution of site‐level impacts. Our results indicate that invasive species abundance and abundance–impact curves ultimately affect how invasive species impacts are distributed across the landscape, which has important implications for invasive species management.},

Les résultats montrent l’intérêt d’analyser les activités hémocytaires à l’échelle des sous populations comparativement à l’approche globale ne tenant pas compte de la diversité cellulaire. Il a été observé que certains facteurs comme le statut reproducteur ou l’espèce échantillonnée (D. polymorpha vs D. bugensis) constituent des facteurs de confusion importants.

The zebra mussel has biological traits making it an interesting species for environmental monitoring. In this organism, hemocyte cells constitute an interesting target to develop a multi-biomarker approach. These cells possess multiple functionalities and are involved in all major physiological functions of the species and in homeostasis regulation. The objective of this work was to develop analytical tools to study hemocyte responses of zebra mussels. Experiments allowed characterizing structure of hemocyte populations and their functionalities linked with phagocytosis process. Use of these biomarkers in various contexts indicated an important adaptation capacity of the species to environmental conditions. Results highlighted interest to analyze hemocyte activities at subpopulation scale comparatively to global approach that does not consider hemocyte diversity. It was demonstrated that parameters such as reproductive status or sampled species (D. polymorpha vs D. bugensis) constitute important confounding factors. Studies also demonstrated a strong positioning of phagocytosis assay as a sensitive marker to contaminants.

	abstract = {The study of the copepod Eurytemora affinis has provided unprecedented insights into mechanisms of invasive success. In this invited review, I summarize a subset of work from my laboratory to highlight key insights gained from studying E. affinis as a model system. Invasive species with brackish origins are overrepresented in freshwater habitats. The copepod E. affinis is an example of such a brackish invader, and has invaded freshwater habitats multiple times independently in recent years. These invasions were accompanied by the evolution of physiological tolerance and plasticity, increased body fluid regulation, and evolutionary shifts in ion transporter (V‐type H+ ATPase, Na+, K+‐ATPase) activity and expression. These evolutionary changes occurred in parallel across independent invasions in nature and in laboratory selection experiments. Selection appears to act on standing genetic variation during invasions, and maintenance of this variation is likely facilitated through ‘beneficial reversal of dominance’ in salinity tolerance across habitats. Expression of critical ion transporters is localized in newly discovered Crusalis leg organs. Increased freshwater tolerance is accompanied by costs to development time and greater requirements for food. High‐food concentration increases low‐salinity tolerance, allowing saline populations to invade freshwater habitats. Mechanisms observed here likely have relevance for other taxa undergoing fundamental niche expansions.},

Native community structure and function can vary greatly in space and time, owing to abiotic variables that could potentially be affected by non‐native species. Here, we sought to determine the relative importance of abiotic variables and an invasive predatory fish, the Eurasian round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), on local macroinvertebrate assemblages and benthic algal production in the St. Lawrence River. We used structural equation modeling to evaluate the strength of interaction pathways between hypothesized biotic and abiotic factors driving trophic cascades. Our results indicate that biotic interactions with the round goby drive changes in the abundances of native grazers and non‐native dreissenid mussels in the St. Lawrence River. However, the directionality of these effects contradicts previous studies of round goby impacts that emphasized top‐down control. We found positive correlations between round goby density and prey (dreissenid and grazer) densities, suggesting complex interactions between round gobies and benthic communities, including strong bottom‐up forces. Together with previous studies, our results suggest that, although the interactions between round gobies and benthic communities remain strong, the direction of these interactions varies over space and time. Our results highlight the importance of disentangling the respective roles of biotic interactions and abiotic factors, in order to properly assess the impacts of non‐native species as well as the spatiotemporal variability of such impacts.},

	abstract = {The European population of Greater Scaup Aythya marila has experienced an alarming, {\textasciitilde}60\% decline in numbers over the last two decades. The brackish lagoons of the Odra River Estuary (ORE) in the south-western Baltic Sea, represent an important area for the species during the non-breeding season in Europe. The lagoons regularly support over 20 000 Scaup, with peaks exceeding 100 000 (38\%–70\% of the population wintering in NW Europe and the highest number recorded in April 2011–105 700). In the ORE, Scaup feed almost exclusively on the non-native Zebra Mussel Dreissena polymorpha. This mussel was present in the ORE already in the 19th century and continues to be superabundant. Using the results of 22 Scaup censuses (November to April 2002/2003 to 2013/2014) from the whole ORE (523 km2 of water), we show that Scaup flocks follow areas with the greatest area of occurrence and biomass of the Zebra Mussel, while areas with low mussel densities are ignored. The numbers of Scaup in the ORE are primarily related to the area of Zebra Mussel occurrence on the lagoon’s bottom (km2) in a non-linear fashion. Zebra Mussels were absolutely prevalent (97\% of biomass) in the digestive tracts of birds unintentionally by-caught in fishing nets (n = 32). We estimate that Scaup alone consume an average of 5 400 tons of Zebra Mussels annually, which represents 5.6\% of the total resources of the mussel in the ORE. Our results provide a clear picture of the strong dependence of the declining, migratory duck species on the non-native mussel, its primary food in the ORE. Our findings are particularly important as they can form the basis for the conservation action plan aimed at saving the north-western European populations of Scaup.},

	abstract = {The risk of quagga mussel (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis Andrusov 1897) establishment into water-bodies of the western US has expanded the geographic concern regarding the ecological and economic impacts this species will have in aquatic ecosystems. Thresholds based on calcium concentrations, an element critical for mussel growth and physiology, have been used as a primary predictor of quagga mussel establishment success to aid management decisions. We evaluated the invasion potential of quagga mussels in low calcium waters using laboratory experiments to compare the survival, growth and reproductive potential of adult mussels held for 90 days at low (9 and 12 ppm), moderate (15 to 32 ppm) and high (72 ppm) calcium water concentrations. In conjunction with adult experiments, veliger stage survival, growth and settlement were evaluated under similar low, moderate, and high calcium water treatments. Adult mussels survived, grew and showed reproductive potential in low calcium water (12 ppm). Veligers were also able to survive, grow and settle in low calcium water. Higher levels of natural seston biomass appeared to improve adult mussel life history performance in low calcium water. Survival curve analysis predicted that 99\% adult mortality could occur in {\textless}170 days at 9 ppm and 12 ppm, however water with {\textgreater}15 ppm could have adults surviving more than a year. The results from these bioassays provide further evidence that quagga mussels have higher risk of establishment in low calcium lakes if habitats exist that have slightly elevated calcium. These results should help emphasize the vulnerability of water-body in the 12 to 15 ppm calcium range that could potentially be at risk of establishing sustainable quagga mussel populations. Furthermore, these results provide insights into the uncertainty of using a single parameter in assigning establishment risk given the complexity of variables in specific water-bodies that influence life history performance of introduced species.},

	abstract = {Invasive alien aquatic species, including marine and freshwater macroinvertebrates, have become increasingly important in terms of both environmental and socio-economic impacts. In order to assess their environmental and economic costs, we applied the Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS) and performed a comparison with other taxa of invaders in Europe. Impacts were scored into six environmental and six socio-economic categories, with each category containing five impact levels. Among 49 aquatic macroinvertebrates, the most impacting species were the Chinese mitten crab, Eriocheir sinensis (Milne-Edwards, 1853) and the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771). The highest impacts found per GISS impact category were, separately; on ecosystems, through predation, as competitors, and on animal production. Eleven species have an impact score {\textgreater} 10 (high impact) and seven reach impact level 5 in at least one impact category (EU blacklist candidates), the maximum score that can be given is 60 impact points. Comparisons were drawn between aquatic macroinvertebrates and vertebrate invaders such as fish, mammals and birds, as well as terrestrial arthropods, revealing invasive freshwater macroinvertebrates to be voracious predators of native prey and damaging to native ecosystems compared with other taxa. GISS can be used to compare these taxa and will aid policy making and targeting of invasive species for management by relevant agencies, or to assist in producing species blacklist candidates.},

	abstract = {The Giant African Snail (Achatina fulica) is considered to be one the world’s 100 worst invasive alien species. The snail has an impact on native biodiversity, and on agricultural and horticultural crops. In India, it is known to feed on more than fifty species of native plants and agricultural crops and also outcompetes the native snails. It was introduced into India in 1847 and since then it has spread all across the country. In this paper, we use ecological niche modeling (ENM) to assess the distribution pattern of Giant African Snail (GAS) under different climate change scenarios. The niche modeling results indicate that under the current climate scenario, Eastern India, peninsular India and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are at high risk of invasion. The three different future climate scenarios show that there is no significant change in the geographical distribution of invasion prone areas. However, certain currently invaded areas will be more prone to invasion in the future. These regions include parts of Bihar, Southern Karnataka, parts of Gujarat and Assam. The Andaman and Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands are highly vulnerable to invasion under changed climate. The Central Indian region is at low risk due to high temperature and low rainfall. An understanding of the invasion pattern can help in better management of this invasive species and also in formulating policies for its control.},

	abstract = {Restricting the spread of invasive quagga and zebra mussels by decontaminating recreational watercraft is an important management practice in Europe and the United States. These mussels impact freshwater ecosystems and leave massive economic costs of restoration for ecological services and human infrastructure for each water body they invade. The authors investigated, at the request of the California Department of Fish and Game, whether decontaminating watercraft by placement into saline waters after coming into contact with freshwater bodies infested with invasive mussels eliminates the risk of spreading the species. Evaluating whether or not this is a viable management practice is critical where zebra and quagga mussel freshwater habitats are directly connected to brackish and saline water bodies, like the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (Delta), California United States of American (USA). In this study, quagga mussels were exposed to water collected from different locations within the Delta, with salinities ranging from 4 parts per thousand (ppt) to 33.4 ppt for up to fifteen days. We observed a mortality gradient correlating to salinity levels. The water with the highest salinity content killed 100\% of the quagga mussels within 40 hours. One hundred percent mortality was not observed until 70 hours of exposure for quagga mussels exposed to lower salinity concentrations of 21.3 ppt and 15.3 ppt. However, 99\% of mussels exposed to 4.0 ppt salinity brackish water remained alive for the 16 day duration of the study. These results are similar to mussels held in water with low salinity content similar to most freshwaters. In the Delta, salinity fluctuates naturally and travel time by boat between saline and freshwaters is a few hours or less. Therefore, it would be challenging if not impossible for watercraft operators to ensure the proper exposure time and salinity exposure. Based on these results, the authors do not recommend launching boats into salt water or brackish water prior to entry into freshwater as a decontamination option for watercraft or as a management tool for preventing invasive mussel infestations.},

	abstract = {The tunicate Ciona intestinalis is an opportunistic invader with high potential for causing economic losses in aquaculture centers. Recent phylogenetic and population genetic analysis support the existence of a genetic complex described as C. intestinalis with two main dominant species (sp A and B) occurring worldwide. In Chile, the species has been observed around 30o S of latitude, but no official reports exist for the presence of C. intestinalis in southern regions (above 40o S), where most of the mollusk aquaculture centers are located. Here, we used occurrences from multiple invaded regions and extensive field sampling to model and validate the environmental conditions that allow the species to persist and to find the geographic areas with the most suitable environmental conditions for the spread of C. intestinalis in the Chilean coast. By studying the potential expansion of C. intestinalis southward in the Chilean Coast, we aimed to provide valuable information that might help the development of control plans before the species becomes a significant problem, especially above 40o S. Our results highlight that, by using portions of the habitat that are apparently distinguishable, the species seem to be not only genetically distinct, but ecologically distinct as well. The two regional models fitted for sp A and for sp B showed disagreement on which sections of Chilean coastline are considered more suitable for these species. While the model for sp A identifies moderately to highly suitable areas between 30o and 40o S, the model for sp B classifies the areas around 45o S as the most appropriate. Data from field sampling show a positive linear relationship between density of C. intestinalis and the index of suitability for sp A in aquaculture centers. Understanding the relation of the distinct species with the surrounding environment provided valuable insights about probable routes of dispersion in Chile, especially into those areas considered suitable for aquaculture activities but where the species has not yet been recorded. We discuss the implications of our findings as a useful tool to anticipate the invasion of such harmful invasive species with regard to the most relevant environmental variables.},

The new resources mean an additional three mobile inspection and decontamination crews will be dedicated to stopping and ensuring boats are free of mussels. The teams will be based in Cranbrook, Valemount and Nelson, to target major entry points from Alberta and the U.S. The new teams join three other crews that are already operational, doubling the number of mobile units dedicated to protecting B.C.s lakes and rivers against the threat of quagga and zebra mussels.


Aquatic invasive species, such as zebra and quagga mussels, pose a significant threat to Canadas freshwater ecosystems and critical infrastructure such as hydroelectric and drinking water facilities.

We compiled and analyzed a database of natural history and ecological traits of 138 coastal marine invertebrate species, the environmental conditions at sites to which they have been introduced, and their date of first introduction. We found that time since introduction explained the largest fraction (20\%) of the variability in non-native range size, while traits of the species and environmental variables had significant, but minimal, influence on non-native range size. The positive relationship between time since introduction and range size indicates that non-native marine invertebrate species are not at equilibrium and are still spreading, posing a major challenge for management of coastal ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Invasive species can affect the function and structure of natural ecological communities, hence understanding and predicting their potential for spreading is a major ecological challenge. Once established in a new region, the spread of invasive species is largely controlled by their dispersal capacity, local environmental conditions and species interactions. The mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis is native to the Mediterranean and is the most successful marine invader in southern Africa. Its distribution there has expanded rapidly and extensively since the 1970s, however, over the last decade its spread has ceased. In this study, we coupled broad scale field surveys, Ecological Niche Modelling (ENM) and Lagrangian Particle Simulations (LPS) to assess the current invaded distribution of M. galloprovincialis in southern Africa and to evaluate what prevents further spread of this species. Results showed that all environmentally suitable habitats in southern Africa have been occupied by the species. This includes rocky shores between Rocky Point in Namibia and East London in South Africa (approx. 2800 km) and these limits coincide with the steep transitions between cool-temperate and subtropical-warmer climates, on both west and southeast African coasts. On the west coast, simulations of drifting larvae almost entirely followed the northward and offshore direction of the Benguela current, creating a clear dispersal barrier by advecting larvae away from the coast. On the southeast coast, nearshore currents give larvae the potential to move eastwards, against the prevalent Agulhas current and beyond the present distributional limit, however environmental conditions prevent the establishment of the species. The transition between the cooler and warmer water regimes is therefore the main factor limiting the northern spread on the southeast coast; however, biotic interactions with native fauna may also play an important role.},

Invasive dreissenid mussels have spread throughout southwestern United States at unprecedented speeds, and present a unique threat to native ecosystems. This book documents the efforts, both successful and unsuccessful, of individuals and agencies after dreissenid mussels invaded the West. Although the book is designed specifically for scientists and managers fighting invasive mussels in western waterbodies, it offers an opportunity for scientists and lake managers worldwide to compare successful strategies relevant to their unique situation. It includes guidance documents and protocols related to early detection, prevention, regulation, monitoring, and control of these invasive pests in the West. It compares quagga and zebra mussels in the western United States with those mussels colonizing the Great Lakes and European waters.},

	abstract = {Human activities such as transport, trade and tourism are likely to influence the spatial distribution of non-native species and yet, Species Distribution Models (SDMs) that aim to predict the future broad scale distribution of invaders often rely on environmental (e.g. climatic) information only. This study investigates if and to what extent do human activities that directly or indirectly influence nature (hereafter the human footprint) affect the global distribution of invasive species in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. We selected 72 species including terrestrial plants, terrestrial animals, freshwater and marine invasive species of concern in a focus area located in NW Europe (encompassing Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Belgium). Species Distribution Models were calibrated with the global occurrence of species and a set of high-resolution (9×9 km) environmental (e.g. topography, climate, geology) layers and human footprint proxies (e.g. the human influence index, population density, road proximity). Our analyses suggest that the global occurrence of a wide range of invaders is primarily limited by climate. Temperature tolerance was the most important factor and explained on average 42\% of species distribution. Nevertheless, factors related to the human footprint explained a substantial amount (23\% on average) of species distributions. When global models were projected into the focus area, spatial predictions integrating the human footprint featured the highest cumulative risk scores close to transport networks (proxy for invasion pathways) and in habitats with a high human influence index (proxy for propagule pressure). We conclude that human related information–currently available in the form of easily accessible maps and databases—should be routinely implemented into predictive frameworks to inform upon policies to prevent and manage invasions. Otherwise we might be seriously underestimating the species and areas under highest risk of future invasions.},

To examine mechanisms affecting species establishment within a large lake, we combined observations of recreational boater movements with empirical measurements of habitat suitability represented by nearshore wave energy to assess the relative risk of Eurasian watermilfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum) establishment. The model was evaluated using information from a 17 year (1995–2012) sequence of M. spicatum presence and absence monitoring. M. spicatum presence was not specifically correlated with recreational boater movements; however its establishment appears to be limited by wave action in Lake Tahoe. Of the sites in the “High” establishment risk category (n = 37), 54\% had current or historical infestations, which included 8 of the 10 sites with the highest relative risk. Of the 11 sites in the “Medium” establishment risk category, 5 had current or historical M. spicatum populations. Most (76\%) of the sites in the “Low” establishment risk category were observed in locations with higher wave action. Four sites that received zero boater visits from infested locations were occupied by M. spicatum. This suggests that the boater survey either represents incomplete coverage of boater movement, or other processes, such as the movement of propagules by surface currents or introductions from external sources are important to the establishment of this species. This study showed the combination of habitat specific and dispersal data in a relative risk framework can potentially reduce uncertainty in estimates of invasion risk.},

	abstract = {An evaluation of Zequanox® (a naturally derived biopesticide that is non-toxic to humans and other aquatic life and selectively kills dreissenid mussels) for controlling zebra mussel infestations in shallow-water habitats in lakes was conducted at Deep Quarry Lake in DuPage County, Illinois during summer 2012 and 2013. During the 2012 trial, three sets of paired 24-m² treatment and control sites were established within the lake, while a single 324-m² treatment site was established for the 2013 trial. Zequanox was applied to treatment plots, contained using PVC barrier curtains, and barriers were removed during the morning following application. Zebra mussel mortality and size distributions on natural substrates were assessed one day and one week post-treatment for 2012 trials and one day and two weeks post-treatment for 2013 trials; percent mortality of zebra mussels in mesh containers in treatment and control sites was also monitored up to 14 days and 48 days post-treatment in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Several water quality parameters were measured in control and treatment plots before and during application and up to 14 d post-treatment. Mean percent mortality for adult zebra mussels on natural and artificial substrates in treatment locations 7–48 d following Zequanox application ranged from 92–98\% during both years, while mortality was consistently ≤10\% in control locations. Mean percent mortality ranged from 15–76\% in locations {\textgreater} 5 m from and in water shallower than Zequanox application points ({\textless}0.6 m depth) during the 2013 trial likely due to limited product dispersal into these areas. There was no significant difference in the size distribution of live and dead zebra mussels in treatment plots. Mean veliger mortality was 94.4\% 20-h after the start of the 6-h Zequanox treatment period in the treatment area compared to 15.1\% in untreated locations during the 2013 trial. Temporary but substantial reductions in dissolved oxygen were observed in treatment locations during the morning following Zequanox treatment in both 2012 and 2013 trials, likely due to the presence of the barriers that prevented well-oxygenated water from circulating into treatment zones from adjacent areas in the lake. Dissolved oxygen concentrations quickly rebounded to levels consistent with control sites upon removal of barriers. No effects of Zequanox treatment on ammonia, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, biochemical oxygen demand, chlorophyll a, pH, or conductivity were observed. Results suggest that Zequanox has potential as a tool for controlling zebra mussels in shallow-water habitats in lakes without significant long-term effects on water quality.},

	abstract = {The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha, Pallas, 1771) is one of the most invasive species of freshwater bivalves, due to a combination of biological and anthropogenic factors. Once this species has been introduced to a new area, individuals form dense aggregations that are very difficult to remove, leading to many adverse socioeconomic and ecological consequences. In this study, we identified, tested, and validated a new set of polymorphic microsatellite loci (also known as SSRs, Single Sequence Repeats) using a Massive Parallel Sequencing (MPS) platform. After several pruning steps, 93 SSRs could potentially be amplified. Out of these SSRs, 14 were polymorphic, producing a polymorphic yield of 15.05\%. These 14 polymorphic microsatellites were fully validated in a first approximation of the genetic population structure of D. polymorpha in the Iberian Peninsula. Based on this polymorphic yield, we propose a criterion for establishing the number of SSRs that require validation in similar species, depending on the final use of the markers. These results could be used to optimize MPS approaches in the development of microsatellites as genetic markers, which would reduce the cost of this process.},

	abstract = {Biological invasions of aquatic systems disrupt ecological communities, and cause major changes in diversity and ecosystem function. The Laurentian Great Lakes of North America have been dramatically altered by such invasions, especially zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (D. rostriformis bugensis) mussels. Responses to mussel invasions have included increased water clarity, and decreased chlorophyll and phytoplankton abundance. Although not all systems have responded similarly, in general, mussels have changed nutrient dynamics and physical habitat conditions. Therefore examination of different impacts can help us further understand mechanisms that underlie ecosystem responses to biological invasions. To aid our understanding of ecosystem impacts, we sampled established locations along a well-studied trophic gradient in Green Bay, Lake Michigan, after the 1993 zebra mussel invasion. A strong trophic gradient remained during the period sampled after the mussel invasion (2000-2012). However, mean summer chlorophyll increased and other measures of phytoplankton biomass (microscope and electronic cell counting) did not change significantly. Multivariate analyses of phytoplankton community structure demonstrate a significant community shift after the invasion. Cyanobacteria increased in dominance, with Microcystis becoming the major summer taxon in lower Green Bay. Diatom diversity and abundance also increased and Chlorophyta became rare. Phytoplankton responses along the trophic gradient of Green Bay to zebra mussel invasion highlight the importance of mussel effects on nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton diversity and function.},

Over the past century, the decline of freshwater bivalves of the family Unionidae has been greatly accelerated by the invasion of Dreissena. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current infestation rates of unionids by zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (D. rostriformis bugensis) mussels in the lower Great Lakes region 25 years after they nearly extirpated native unionids. In 2011–2012, we collected infestation data for over 4000 unionids from 26 species at 198 nearshore sites in lakes Erie, Ontario, and St. Clair, the Detroit River, and inland Michigan lakes and compared those results to studies from the early 1990s. We found that the frequency of unionid infestation by Dreissena recently declined, and the number of dreissenids attached to unionids in the lower Great Lakes has fallen almost ten-fold since the early 1990s. We also found that the rate of infestation depends on the dominant Dreissena species in the lake: zebra mussels infested unionids much more often and in greater numbers. Consequently, the proportion of infested unionids, as well as the number and weight of attached dreissenids were lower in waterbodies dominated by quagga mussels. This is the first large-scale systematic study that revealed how minor differences between two taxonomically and functionally related invaders may have large consequences for native communities they invade.},

Model predictions for Eurasian Ruffe have been used to direct surveillance efforts within the Great Lakes and DNA evidence of ruffe presence was recently reported from one of three high risk port localities identified by our model. Predictions made for killer shrimp and golden mussel suggest that these two species have the potential to become rapidly widespread if introduced to the Great Lakes, reinforcing the need for proactive ballast water management.

	abstract = {The presence of the North American Marmorkrebs (Procambarus fallax f. virginalis) in European inland waters is entirely driven by ongoing propagule pressure from the ornamental trade. Since 2003 at least 25 independent introduction events have been confirmed, of which some have eventually resulted in established populations. This study links a maximum-entropy model that forecasts the probability of Marmorkrebs introduction based on socio-economic predictors to an updated species distribution model based on environmental predictors in order to explore the risk of further Marmorkrebs establishment in Europe. In line with related research, the probability of Marmorkrebs release was largely affected by gross domestic product and human population density, i.e. predictors very likely related to the density of Marmorkrebs owners, whereas environmental suitability was mostly influenced by minimum temperature and the availability of lentic habitats, which was indirectly assessed by terrain slope. While considerable parts of Europe were predicted as potentially suitable for establishment, high probabilities of introduction were forecasted in much smaller geographic areas. The consensus map of the model predictions suggests that introduction and subsequent establishment of Marmorkrebs is likely to occur in much of Germany, the Benelux countries, England, Italy, and areas of high human population density throughout France and Spain, as well as parts of southernmost Scandinavia and Southeastern Europe. Monitoring trades of Marmorkrebs in these high-risk regions is recommended and implications for proactive measures are discussed, including the need for consistent trade regulations at the EU level.},

	abstract = {With increasing human use of North American inland lakes for recreational purposes, there is a greater probability of the incidental transfer and introduction of aquatic invasive species within them. This raises concern over the potential ecological and economic impacts that invasive species could have in these highly valued freshwater ecosystems. In this study, we focus our interests on 63 inland lakes distributed across the Southern Ontario landscape in order to evaluate whether concerns are warranted over potential adverse impacts of a well-known aquatic invasive species (the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha)) on native fish assemblages and targeted game species (i.e., walleye (Sander vitreus), smallmouth bass (Micropterus dolomieu), lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and northern pike (Esox lucius)). Through the analysis of a comprehensive and multivariate dataset comprising lake morphometric, water chemistry, fish assemblage, fish metric, and zooplankton haul data, we examined the potential consequences of zebra mussel invasions in inland lakes. It was found that condition, growth, and relative abundance of some of the most highly valued game fish in inland lakes significantly varies among lakes with and without zebra mussel, though the nature of such effects differed for each of the fish species examined. In addition, it was shown that the species composition (i.e., identity and relative abundance) of active, large-bodied fish assemblages within a lake can indicate zebra mussel presence/absence with a high degree of certainty. Finally, while correlations between zebra mussel presence and the richness, abundance, growth, and condition of certain fish species were found, the results of this study indicate that the potential consequences of this well-known aquatic invader to fisheries in inland lakes may be less dramatic than those reported within the Great Lakes.},

	abstract = {Due to the invasion of zebra and quagga mussels in European and North American waters, there is a need for an environmentally benign mussel control method to replace chlorine and other currently used control products. Zequanox® is a natural product comprised of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain CL145A, which effectively controls zebra and quagga mussels. The objective of this study was to demonstrate an effective method of zebra mussel control in inland waterways using Zequanox. Water quality was monitored to determine any negative impacts and to observe product dispersion. A curtain made of an impermeable material was placed in the Grand Canal at Tullamore Harbour sealing off two 8 x 0.5 m sections of canal wall under the bridge, and a control site was chosen further down the docking area. Both sections were treated with Zequanox at a concentration of 150 mg active substance/L for an 8 hour treatment period. Water quality was monitored in the treatment area and in the selected control area before, during, and after treatment. Naturally settled and seeded adult zebra mussels were observed for mortality in the treatment and control areas and juveniles were monitored for survival in both the treatment and control areas. Naturally settled adult mussel numbers were reduced by approximately 46\% in treatment side 1, and 65\% in treatment side 2, seeded adult mussel mortality reached 75\% in treatment side 1 and 56\% in treatment side 2. These results demonstrate that under the optimum conditions Zequanox effectively controls zebra mussels in open water.},

While the aquatic plant can offer a food source and habitable location for some fish and invertebrates, Eurasian water milfoil is quick to become problematic. Rapid growth results in thick floating mats of the plant that prohibit light from penetrating the water body. Dissolved oxygen levels are reduced as the Eurasian water milfoil decomposes. These circumstances limit the growth of native beneficial aquatic plants and animals, reducing biodiversity.


Eurasian water milfoil, quagga mussels, and zebra mussels are just three examples of invasive species to watch for in our province. Species such as the New Zealand mudsnail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum), Asian carp, didymo (Didymosphenia geminate) aka Rock Snot and Salt Cedar (Tamarix spp.) are additional examples on the growing list of aquatic invaders.},

We conducted a detailed historical analysis of the mollusc community of Oneida Lake based on our comprehensive lakewide study in 2012 and previous surveys dating back to 1915. In the early 20th century, the lake had a high water clarity, with abundant macrophytes and benthic algae, and hosted the most diverse molluscan community in New York State, including 32 gastropod and 9 unionid species. By the 1960s, lake turbidity increased during a period of anthropogenic eutrophication, resulting in a 38\% decline in species richness and a 95\% reduction in abundance of native gastropods grazing on benthic algae. Following the invasion of Dreissena spp. in 1991 and subsequent increases in water clarity, native gastropod species richness expanded by 37\% and abundance increased 20-fold by 2012. In contrast, filter-feeding unionids were unaffected by increased turbidity during the period of eutrophication but were extirpated by dreissenids. Through contrasting effects on turbidity, eutrophication and Dreissena spp. have likely driven the observed changes in native grazing gastropods by affecting the abundance of light-limited benthic algae. Given the high species richness and ecological importance of benthic grazers, monitoring and managing turbidity is important in preserving molluscan diversity.},

	abstract = {Tanzania's Ruaha landscape is an international priority area for large carnivores, supporting over 10\% of the world's lions and important populations of leopards and spotted hyaenas. However, lack of ecological data on large carnivore distribution and habitat use hinders the development of effective carnivore conservation strategies in this critical landscape. Therefore, the study aimed to (i) identify the most significant ecogeographical variables influencing the potential distribution of lions, leopards and spotted hyaenas across the Ruaha landscape; (ii) identify zones with highest suitability for harbouring those species; and (iii) use species distribution modelling algorithms (SDMs) to define important areas for conservation of large carnivores. Habitat suitability was calculated based on environmental features from georeferenced presence-only carnivore location data. Potential distribution of large carnivores appeared to be strongly influenced by water availability; highly suitable areas were situated close to rivers and experienced above average annual precipitation. Net primary productivity and tree cover also exerted some influence on habitat suitability. All three species showed relatively narrow niche breadth and low tolerance to changes in habitat characteristics. From 21,050 km2 assessed, 8.1\% (1,702 km2) emerged as highly suitable for all three large carnivores collectively. Of that area, 95.4\% (1,624 km2) was located within 30 km of the Park-village border, raising concerns about human-carnivore conflict. This was of particular concern for spotted hyaenas, as they were located significantly closer to the Park boundary than lions and leopards. This study provides the first map of potential carnivore distribution across the globally important Ruaha landscape, and demonstrates that SDMs can be effective for understanding large carnivore habitat requirements in poorly sampled areas. This approach could have relevance for many other important wildlife areas that only have limited, haphazard presence-only data, but which urgently require strategic conservation planning.},

The management of pathways to prevent their introduction and establishment is a key target in the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi biodiversity targets for 2020. Freshwater environments are particularly susceptible to invasions as they are exposed to multiple introduction pathways, including non-native fish stocking and the release of boat ballast water. Since many freshwater INNS and aquatic pathogens can survive for several days in damp environments, there is potential for transport between water catchments on the equipment used by recreational anglers and canoeists. To quantify this biosecurity risk, we conducted an online questionnaire with 960 anglers and 599 canoeists to investigate their locations of activity, equipment used, and how frequently equipment was cleaned and/or dried after use. Anglers were also asked about their use and disposal of live bait. Our results indicate that 64\% of anglers and 78.5\% of canoeists use their equipment/boat in more than one catchment within a fortnight, the survival time of many of the INNS and pathogens considered in this study and that 12\% of anglers and 50\% of canoeists do so without either cleaning or drying their kit between uses. Furthermore, 8\% of anglers and 28\% of canoeists had used their equipment overseas without cleaning or drying it after each use which could facilitate both the introduction and secondary spread of INNS in the UK. Our results provide a baseline against which to evaluate the effectiveness of future biosecurity awareness campaigns, and identify groups to target with biosecurity awareness information. Our results also indicate that the biosecurity practices of these groups must improve to reduce the likelihood of inadvertently spreading INNS and pathogens through these activities.},

	abstract = {Invasions by non-native species are a threat to biodiversity because invaders can impact native populations, communities and entire ecosystems. To manage this threat, it is necessary to have a strong mechanistic understanding of how non-native species affect local species and communities. We reviewed 259 published papers (1972–2012) that described field experiments quantifying the impact of aquatic non-native species, to examine whether various types of study biases are limiting this understanding. Our review revealed that invasion impacts had been experimentally quantified for 101 aquatic non-native species, in all major freshwater and marine habitats, on all continents except Antarctica and for most higher taxonomic groupings. Over one-quarter (26\%) of studies included tests for impacts on local biodiversity. However, despite this extensive research effort, certain taxa, habitats and regions remain poorly studied. For example, of the over one hundred species examined in previous studies, only one was a marine fish and only six were herbivores. Furthermore, over half (53\%) of the studies were from the USA and two-thirds (66\%) were from experiments conducted in temperate latitudes. By contrast, only 3\% of studies were from Africa andgible ecological impacts. In conclusion, a future focus on poorly-studied taxa, habitats and regions, and enhanced reporting of results, should improve our understanding and management of impacts associated with aquatic non-native species.},

	abstract = {The tubenose goby, Proterorhinus semilunaris, has expanded its range throughout Europe. Comprehensive studies to identify its impact on native riverine ecosystems, however, are relatively scarce. Here, we evaluate dietary preferences of P. semilunaris on a non-native river to reveal any such impacts. Fish were sampled monthly over 2011–2012 from three sites along the River Dyje (Czech Republic; Danube basin) with differing population levels and food availability. Both the amount of food consumed and dietary composition varied seasonally, with site having a strong effect. Food consumed differed between males and females, but not dietary composition; while diet differed between age classes, but not food consumed. In general, Trichoptera, Chironomidae and zooplankton dominated the diet at all sites, with Trichoptera taken more often earlier in the year and zooplankton later. Mussels were always avoided, despite high abundance, while less preferred prey were occasionally taken in high numbers in response to increased availability or energy demand (e.g. spawning). Fish eggs and fry (all P. semilunaris) were only taken in high numbers at one site, being related to high population level and fry drift from a reservoir. Male feeding declined over the breeding season, presumably due to nest guarding, while female feeding declined over winter, possibly resulting in high mortality. Proterorhinus semilunaris is a feeding opportunist, which may facilitate colonisation in habitats with poor prey availability. No predation pressure on native species was observed through consumption of eggs or fry, though small/young indigenous fish may be affected through diet competition.Alternate abstract:Le gobie demi-lune, Proterorhinus semilunaris, a élargi son aire de répartition à travers l’Europe. Cependant, les études approfondies afin d’identifier son impact sur les écosystèmes lotiques indigènes, sont relativement rares. Ici, nous évaluons les préférences alimentaires de P. semilunaris dans une rivière où il n’est pas autochtone pour révéler ces impacts. Les poissons ont été échantillonnés mensuellement sur 2011–2012 à partir de trois sites le long de la rivière Dyje (République tchèque; bassin du Danube) avec différents niveaux de population et de disponibilité de la nourriture. À la fois la quantité de nourriture consommée et la composition alimentaire variaient saisonnièrement, le site ayant un effet important. La quantité d’aliments consommés différait entre les sexes, mais pas la composition alimentaire; le régime alimentaire différait entre les classes d’âge. En général, les trichoptères, les larves de chironomes et le zooplancton ont dominé le régime à tous les sites, avec les trichoptères consommés plus souvent plus tôt dans l’année et le zooplancton plus tard. Les moules ont été toujours évitées, malgré leur forte abondance, bien que cette proie moins préférée ait été parfois prise en grand nombre en réponse à sa disponibilité accrue ou à la demande d’énergie (par exemple, pour l’ovogénèse). Les œufs de poissons et les alevins (tous de P. semilunaris) n’ont été pris en grand nombre qu’à un seul site, étant lié à un niveau élevé de la population et à la dérive des alevins à partir d’un réservoir. L’alimentation des mâles a diminué au cours de la saison de reproduction, probablement en raison de la garde des nids, tandis que l’alimentation des femelles a baissé pendant l’hiver, ce qui peut entraîner une mortalité élevée. Proterorhinus semilunaris est un opportuniste dans son alimentation, ce qui peut faciliter la colonisation dans les habitats avec une faible disponibilité en proies. Aucune pression de prédation sur les espèces indigènes n’a été observée par la consommation d’œufs ou d’alevins, mais les petits/jeunes poissons indigènes peuvent être affectés par la concurrence alimentaire.},

Following this concept, we studied the genetic constitution of zebra mussel populations from a polluted (Dp) and reference sites (Cl) at the river Drava, Croatia, and applied microsatellite and DNA damage analyses (Comet assay, micronucleus test (MNT)). Additionally, mussels from both populations were exposed to polluted wastewater in the laboratory for three days, and DNA damage was analyzed to evaluate acclimatization and genetic adaptation of the investigated populations to the polluted environment.  The two populations differed in their genetic constitution. Microsatellite analysis suggested that Dp had undergone a genetic bottleneck. Comet assay did not indicate any difference in DNA damage between the two populations, but MNT revealed that Dp had an increased percentage of micronuclei in hemocytes in comparison to Cl. The laboratory experiment revealed that Dp had a lower percentage of tail DNA and a higher percentage of micronuclei than Cl. These differences between populations were possibly caused by an overall decreased fitness of Dp due to genetic drift and by an enhanced DNA repair mechanism due to acclimatization to pollution in the source habitat.},

	abstract = {The risk of species invasions in coastal Alaska is increasing due to the continued growth of global shipping and the expansion of trans-arctic trade routes. Coastal Alaska receives about 14 million metric tons of ballast water annually from 49 global ecoregions, including several highly invaded port systems along the west coast of North America. This study reviews the history and drivers of ballast water management policy in the United States and the impacts of policy changes and vessel practices on the risk of ballast-borne species invasions to coastal Alaska. We assessed spatial and temporal trends in ballast water discharge and management practices of vessels arriving to Alaska as reported to the National Ballast Information Clearinghouse from 2005 – 2012. Notably, the Environmental Protection Agency's 2008 Vessel General Permit (VGP) triggered a sharp increase in reporting and an apparent 440\% increase in total volume of ballast discharged between 2008 and 2009 by requiring previously exempted management and record keeping practices by crude oil tankers involved in coastwise trade, the dominant vessel type to discharge ballast in the state of Alaska. A vector-based risk assessment of post-VGP ballast water discharge to the top 15 ports of Alaska by volume indicates that the port of Valdez is most at risk of invasion. Klawock and Tolstoi Bay are least at risk. This is the first study to assess the risk of ballast-borne marine invasive species throughout coastal Alaska.},

	abstract = {Cascading trophic interactions are often defined as the indirect effects of a predator on primary producers through the effect of the predator on herbivores. These effects can be both direct through removal of herbivores [density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs)] or indirect through changes in the behavior of the herbivores [trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs)]. How the relative importance of these two indirect interactions varies with predator diversity remains poorly understood. We tested the effect of predator diversity on both TMIIs and DMIIs on phytoplankton using two competitive invasive dreissenid mussel species (zebra mussel and quagga mussel) as the herbivores and combinations of one, two or all three species of the predators pumpkinseed sunfish, round goby, and rusty crayfish. Predators had either direct access to mussels and induced both TMII and DMII, or no direct access and induced only TMII through the presence of risk cues. In both sets of treatments, the predators induced a trophic cascade which resulted in more phytoplankton remaining with predators present than with only mussels present. The trophic cascade was weaker in three-predator and two-predator treatments than in one-predator treatments when predators had direct access to dreissenids (DMIIs and TMIIs). Crayfish had higher cascading effects on phytoplankton than both pumpkinseed and round goby. Increased predator diversity decreased the strength of DMIIs but had no effect on the strength of TMIIs. The strength of TMIIs was higher with zebra than quagga mussels. Our study suggests that inter-specific interference among predators in multi-species treatments weakens the consumptive cascading effects of predation on lower trophic levels whereas the importance of predator diversity on trait mediated effects depends on predator identity.},

	abstract = {Of the 7,000 estimated non-native species present in North America, approximately 1,000 are invasive. Clearly, invasive species are in the minority, but their small numbers don't keep them from causing billions of dollars in economic and ecological harm each year. Policymakers and ecologists continue to try to figure out which species might be harmful, which invasive species are doing the most damage, and which of these might respond best to eradication efforts. Invasive species reports and case studies are prevalent in political, environmental, and scientific news cycles, and a significant portion of the public is concerned about the issue. In Invasive Species: What Everyone Needs to Know®, Simberloff will first cover basic topics such as how non-native species are introduced, which areas have incurred the most biological invasions, and how the rates of biological invasions have shifted in recent years. He then moves on to the direct and indirect impacts of the impacts of invasive species on various ecosystems, such as habitat and resource competition, how invasive species transmit pathogens, and how introduced plants and animals can modify a habitat to favor other non-native species. Simberloff's final chapters will discuss the evolution of invasive species, the policies we currently have in place to manage them, and future prospects for controlling their spread. The book will also contain a section dedicated to the more controversial topics surrounding invasive species: invasive natives, useful non-native species, animal rights versus species rights, and non-native species' impacts on the biodiversity of an ecosystem.

	abstract = {Two field experiments were carried out using a custom built flow-through laboratory to test the effect of elevated pH on dreissenid mussels as a potential control method. Both experiments tested the ability of dreissenid pediveligers to settle under conditions of elevated pH and the long-term survival of adult dreissenids under the same conditions. The two experimental sites had different water quality and different species of dreissenids present. The settlement of quagga mussel pediveligers at the lower Colorado River was inhibited with increasing pH. At the maximum achieved pH of 9.1, there was approximately 90\% reduction compared to the maximum settlement observed in the controls. Since the settlement was almost as low in pH 8.9 as at pH 9.1, the inhibition in settlement may have been due to the presence of a precipitate formed under high pH conditions rather than the increase in background pH. No mortality of quagga mussel adults was observed in the experimental pH levels at the lower Colorado River. At San Justo Reservoir, zebra mussel settlement decreased with increasing pH. New settlement was almost entirely absent at the highest pH tested (pH 9.6). The observed mortality of adult zebra mussels was low, but did tend to increase with increasing pH. We also tested the response of adult zebra mussels to short-term exposure to very high pH levels (i.e. pH 10, 11, and 12). Adult mussels in poor physical condition experienced 90\% mortality after 12 hours at pH 12. For unstressed adult zebra mussels, 90\% mortality was reached after 120 hours at pH 12. Significant mortalities were also observed both at pH 10 and pH 11. From this study, we conclude that pH elevation could be used both as a preventative treatment to eliminate settlement by dreissenid mussels and as an end of season treatment to eliminate adults. The high pH treatment would have to be tailored to the site water quality to prevent formation of precipitate during treatment and to minimize corrosive action on materials of construction.},

Zequanox® is a newly commercialised microbial biocide for zebra and quagga mussels comprised of killed Pseudomonas fluorescens CL145A cells. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of a developmental formulation of Zequanox (referred to as MBI 401 FDP) and chlorine treatments on adult and juvenile zebra mussels by running a biobox trial in conjunction with chlorine treatments at an infested Irish drinking water treatment plant. Since 2009, the plant management has used a residual chlorine concentration of 2 mg/L in autumn to control both adult zebra mussels and juvenile settlement in their three concrete raw water chambers. Juvenile mussel settlement was monitored in three bioboxes as well as in three treatment chambers in the plant for three months prior to treatment. Adult mussels were seeded into the chambers and bioboxes four days before treatment. In October 2011, the bioboxes were treated with MBI 401 FDP at 200 mg active substance/L, while chlorine treatment took place in the water chambers. The MBI 401 FDP treatment lasted only 8 hours while chlorine treatment lasted seven days. Juvenile numbers were reduced to zero in both the bioboxes and treated chambers within seven days. Adult mussel mortality reached 80\% for both the chlorine and MBI 401 FDP treatment; however, mortality was achieved faster in the chlorine treatment. These results provided important insights into zebra mussel control alternatives to chlorine and supported further development of the now commercial product, Zequanox.},

	abstract = {Habitat degradation and species introductions are two of the leading causes of species declines on a global scale. Invasive species negatively impact native species through predation and competition for limited resources. The impacts of invasive species may be increased in habitats where habitat degradation is higher due to reductions of prey abundance and distribution. Using stable isotope analyses and extensive measurements of resource availability we determined how resource availability impacts the long term carbon and nitrogen assimilation of the invasive red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) and a native, threatened species, the red-bellied turtle (Pseudemys rubriventris) at two different freshwater wetland complexes in Pennsylvania, USA. At a larger wetland complex with greater vegetative species richness and diversity, our stable isotope analyses showed dietary niche partitioning between species, whereas analyses from a smaller wetland complex with lower vegetative species richness and diversity showed significant dietary niche overlap. Determining the potential for competition between these two turtle species is important to understanding the ecological impacts of red-eared slider turtles in wetland habitats. In smaller wetlands with increased potential for competition between native turtles and invasive red-eared slider turtles we expect that when shared resources become limited, red-eared slider turtles will negatively impact native turtle species leading to long term population declines. Protection of intact wetland complexes and the reduction of introduced species populations are paramount to preserving populations of native species.},

	abstract = {We explored possible links between vector activity and genetic diversity in introduced populations of Limnoperna fortunei by characterizing the genetic structure in native and introduced ranges in Asia and South America. We surveyed 24 populations: ten in Asia and 14 in South America using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene, as well as eight polymorphic microsatellite markers. We performed population genetics and phylogenetic analyses to investigate population genetic structure across native and introduced regions. Introduced populations in Asia exhibit higher genetic diversity (HE = 0.667–0.746) than those in South America (HE = 0.519–0.575), suggesting higher introduction effort for the former populations. We observed pronounced geographical structuring in introduced regions, as indicated by both mitochondrial and nuclear markers based on multiple genetic analyses including pairwise ФST, FST, Bayesian clustering method, and three-dimensional factorial correspondence analyses. Pairwise FST values within both Asia (FST = 0.017–0.126, P = 0.000–0.009) and South America (FST = 0.004–0.107, P = 0.000–0.721) were lower than those between continents (FST = 0.180–0.319, P = 0.000). Fine-scale genetic structuring was also apparent among introduced populations in both Asia and South America, suggesting either multiple introductions of distinct propagules or strong post-introduction selection and demographic stochasticity. Higher genetic diversity in Asia as compared to South America is likely due to more frequent propagule transfers associated with higher shipping activities between source and donor regions within Asia. This study suggests that the intensity of human-mediated introduction vectors influences patterns of genetic diversity in non-indigenous species.},

	abstract = {In an effort to develop an efficacious and environmentally safe method for managing zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussels (Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), we initiated a research project investigating the potential use of bacteria and their natural metabolic products as biocontrol agents. This project resulted in the discovery of an environmental isolate lethal to dreissenid mussels, Pseudomonas fluorescens strain CL145A (Pf-CL145A). In previous published reports we have demonstrated that: 1) Pf-CL145A’s mode of action is intoxication (not infection); 2) natural product within ingested bacterial cells lyse digestive tract epithelial cells leading to dreissenid death; and 3) high dreissenid kill rates ({\textgreater}90\%) are achievable following treatment with Pf-CL145A cells, irrespective of whether the bacterial cells are dead or alive. Investigating the environmental safety of Pf-CL145A was also a key element in our research efforts, and herein, we report the results of non-target trials demonstrating Pf-CL145A’s high specificity to dreissenids. These acute toxicity trials were typically single-dose, short-term (24-72 h) exposures to Pf-CL145A cells under aerated conditions at concentrations highly lethal to dreissenids (100 or 200 mg/L). These trials produced no evidence of mortality among the ciliate Colpidium colpoda, the cladoceran Daphnia magna, three fish species (Pimephales promelas, Salmo trutta, and Lepomis macrochirus), and seven bivalve species (Mytilus edulis, Pyganodon grandis, Pyganodon cataracta, Lasmigona compressa, Strophitus undulatus, Lampsilis radiata, and Elliptio complanata). Low mortality (3-27\%) was recorded in the amphipod Hyalella azteca, but additional trials suggested that most, if not all, of the mortality could be attributed to some other unidentified factor (e.g., possibly particle load or a water quality issue) rather than Pf-CL145A’s dreissenid-killing natural product. In terms of potential environmental safety, the results of these invertebrate and vertebrate non-target trials are encouraging, but it would be unrealistic to think that dreissenids are the only aquatic organisms sensitive to Pf-CL145A’s dreissenid-killing natural product. Additional testing is needed to better define Pf-CL145A’s margin of safety by identifying the sensitivity of other susceptible organisms. The results of these non-target safety trials – in combination with equally promising mussel control efficacy data – have now led to Pf-CL145A’s commercialization under the product name Zequanox®, with dead cells as the product’s active ingredient. The commercial availability of only dead-cell Zequanox formulations will eliminate the risk of any possible non-target infection by Pf-CL145A, further reducing environmental concerns. During the non-target project reported herein, the limited quantities of Pf-CL145A cells that we were able to culture severely restricted the number and size of our trials. In contrast, the availability of Zequanox will now greatly expand the opportunities for non-target testing. The trials reported herein – exposing non-target organisms under aerated conditions to unformulated, laboratory-cultured cells – clearly point to Pf-CL145A’s potential for high host specificity, but non-target trials with Zequanox – using Pf-CL145A cells cultured, killed, and formulated using industrial-scale protocols – will be even more important as they will define the non-target safety limits of the actual commercial products under a wide range of environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {On 6 January 2007, invasive quagga mussels [Dreissena rostriformis bugensis (Andrusov, 1897)] were discovered in the Boulder Basin of Lake Mead, Nevada, a popular site for recreational boating in the southwestern United States. Recreational watercraft are considered a primary vector for overland dispersal of quagga mussel veliger larvae between water bodies. Thus, effective decontamination of veligers in residual water carried by trailered recreation boats is critical to controlling this species’ spread. The survival rate of quagga mussel veligers was measured during exposure to environmental temperature conditions mimicking those experienced in the residual water of trailered vessels during warm summer and cooler autumn months in the semi-arid southwestern United States. Under warm summer conditions, quagga mussel veligers survived approximately five days while under cooler autumn conditions they survived 27 days. When tested under autumn temperature conditions veliger survival times increased with increased level of larval development. The results suggested a greater likelihood of veliger transport in the residual water of trailered watercraft during autumn months. The results indicated that presently recommended vessel quarantine times to kill all externally attached juvenile and adult dreissenid mussels prior to launching in an uninfested water body should be increased to generate 100\% veliger mortality in residual water unable to be fully drained from the internal areas of watercraft.},

As numbers increased, a filtering-collector caddisfly (Smicridea fasciatella McLachlan, 1871) declined significantly in abundance. After two years of colonization, freshwater sponges were detected and associated with a decline in D. r. bugensis numbers. Periphyton biomass increased considerably on substrates; perhaps partially, the result of decreased turbidity. Aqueduct biofoulers could have major impacts on costs associated with aqueduct maintenance. From an operations viewpoint, mussels are undesirable due to flow restriction associated with increased friction. Augmented sponge and periphyton biomass may also influence aqueduct operations and efficiencies.},

	abstract = {Predicting the potential range of invasive species is essential for risk assessment, monitoring, and management, and it can also inform us about a species’ overall potential invasiveness. However, modeling the distribution of invasive species that have not reached their equilibrium distribution can be problematic for many predictive approaches. We apply the modeling approach of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) that is effective with incomplete, presence-only datasets to predict the distribution of the invasive island apple snail, Pomacea insularum. This freshwater snail is native to South America and has been spreading in the USA over the last decade from its initial introductions in Texas and Florida. It has now been documented throughout eight southeastern states. The snail’s extensive consumption of aquatic vegetation and ability to accumulate and transmit algal toxins through the food web heighten concerns about its spread. Our model shows that under current climate conditions the snail should remain mostly confined to the coastal plain of the southeastern USA where it is limited by minimum temperature in the coldest month and precipitation in the warmest quarter. Furthermore, low pH waters (pH {\textless}5.5) are detrimental to the snail’s survival and persistence. Of particular note are low-pH blackwater swamps, especially Okefenokee Swamp in southern Georgia (with a pH below 4 in many areas), which are predicted to preclude the snail’s establishment even though many of these areas are well matched climatically. Our results elucidate the factors that affect the regional distribution of P. insularum, while simultaneously presenting a spatial basis for the prediction of its future spread. Furthermore, the model for this species exemplifies that combining climatic and habitat variables is a powerful way to model distributions of invasive species.},

We combined information about pre- and postdreissenid abundance, biomass, and secondary production of the littoral benthos with results of carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis of archival (predreissenid) and recent (postdreissenid) samples of all common benthic taxa. This approach enabled us to determine the importance of benthic and sestonic carbon to the littoral food web before, and more than a decade after dreissenid establishment. Long term dreissenid presence was associated with a 32-fold increase in abundance, 6-fold increase in biomass, and 14-fold increase in secondary production of the littoral benthos. Dreissenids comprised a large portion of the post-invasion benthos, making up 13, 38, and 56\% of total abundance, biomass, and secondary production, respectively. The predreissenid food web was supported primarily by benthic primary production, while sestonic material was relatively more important to the postdreissenid food web. The absolute importance of both sestonic material and benthic primary production to the littoral benthos increased considerably following dreissenid establishment. Our results show drastic alterations to food web structure and suggest that dreissenid mussels redirect energy and material from the water column to the littoral benthos both through biodeposition of sestonic material as well as stimulation of benthic primary production.},

A total of 981 sites located in streams and rivers in Germany. Therefore we analyzed presence–absence data of alien and indigenous amphipods, isopods, gastropods, and bivalves from 981 sites located in small to large rivers in Germany with regard to eight environmental variables: chloride, ammonium, nitrate, oxygen, orthophosphate, distance to the next navigable waterway, and maximum and minimum temperature. Degraded sites close to navigable waters were exposed to an increased invasion risk by all major groups of alien species. Moreover, invaded sites by all four groups of alien species were similar, whereas the sites where indigenous members of the four groups occurred were more variable. Increased temperature and chloride concentration as well as decreased oxygen concentration were identified as major factors for the invasibility of a site. Species‐specific analyses showed that chloride was among the three most predictive environmental variables determining species assemblage in all four taxonomic groups. Also distance to the next navigable waterways was similarly important. Additionally, the minimum temperature was among the most important variables for amphipods, isopods, and bivalves. The bias in the occurrence patterns of alien species toward similarly degraded habitats suggests that the members of all four major groups of freshwater alien species are a non‐random, more tolerant set of species. Their common tolerance to salinity, high temperature, and oxygen depletion may reflect that most alien species were spread in ballast water tanks, where strong selective pressures, particularly temperature fluctuations, oxygen depletion, and increased salinity may create a bottleneck for successful invasion. Knowledge on the major factors that influence the invasion risk of a habitat is needed to develop strategies to limit the spread of invasive species.},

In freshwater systems, degradation of adjacent terrestrial vegetation may facilitate introduced species by altering resource availability. Here we examine how the presence of intact riparian cover influences the impact of an invasive herbivorous snail, Tarebia granifera, on nitrogen (N) cycling in aquatic systems on the island of Trinidad. We quantified snail biomass, growth, and N excretion in locations where riparian vegetation was present or removed to determine how snail demographics and excretion were related to the condition of the riparian zone. In three Neotropical streams, we measured snail biomass and N excretion in open and closed canopy habitats to generate estimates of mass- and area-specific N excretion rates. Snail biomass was 2 to 8 times greater and areal N excretion rates ranged from 3 to 9 times greater in open canopy habitats. Snails foraging in open canopy habitat also had access to more abundant food resources and exhibited greater growth and mass-specific N excretion rates. Estimates of ecosystem N demand indicated that snail N excretion in fully closed, partially closed, and open canopy habitats supplied 2\%, 11\%, and 16\% of integrated ecosystem N demand, respectively. We conclude that human-mediated riparian canopy loss can generate hotspots of snail biomass, growth, and N excretion along tropical stream networks, altering the impacts of an invasive snail on the biogeochemical cycling of N.},

Interactions occurring among these invaders have important implications for ecosystem structure and functioning, yet they are poorly understood. Here we apply newly developed metrics derived from stable isotope data to provide quantitative measures of trophic diversity within populations or species. We then use these to test the hypothesis that sympatric invaders belonging to the same functional feeding group occupy a smaller isotopic niche than their allopatric counterparts. Two introduced, globally important, benthic omnivores, Louisiana swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) and carp (Cyprinus carpio), are sympatric in Lake Naivasha, Kenya. We applied our metrics to an 8-year data set encompassing the establishment of carp in the lake. We found a strong asymmetric interaction between the two invasive populations, as indicated by inverse correlations between carp abundance and measures of crayfish trophic diversity. Lack of isotopic niche overlap between carp and crayfish in the majority of years indicated a predominantly indirect interaction. We suggest that carp-induced habitat alteration reduced the diversity of crayfish prey, resulting in a reduction in the dietary niche of crayfish. Stable isotopes provide an integrated signal of diet over space and time, offering an appropriate scale for the study of population niches, but few isotope studies have retained the often insightful information revealed by variability among individuals in isotope values. Our population metrics incorporate such variation, are robust to the vagaries of sample size and are a useful additional tool to reveal subtle dietary interactions among species. Although we have demonstrated their applicability specifically using a detailed temporal dataset of species invasion in a lake, they have a wide array of potential ecological applications.},

	abstract = {Campaigns designed to foster stewardship have been executed with some success; however, a disproportionate number of examples come from urban, affluent communities. Using a case study in northeast Michigan, I created a transferable conservation campaign model that helps practitioners perform elements of successful campaign design by providing considerations for both urban and rural audiences based on capacity, culture, and land use. I interviewed 30 participants from three groups—natural resource managers, communication practitioners, and citizen stakeholders—to investigate stewardship motivation and whether differences between urban and rural communities impact the transferability of conservation campaigns. I found that differences in capacity (financial and human resources) and land use and culture between urban and rural communities strongly affect motivations for stewardship and should inform conservation campaign design. For example, interviewees said the way people use and relate to natural resources affects their value of conservation (56.7\%) and recommended framing conservation messaging around the audience's interests (50.0\%). However, interviewees also said urban and rural communities use and relate to natural resources in different ways (70.0\%) and that rural connection with natural resources is often based on economics and livelihood, while urban residents connect on a social or recreational level (40.0\%). These and other findings helped inform the conservation campaign model I created, with the objectives of (1) incorporating a broad spectrum of community capacities and cultures; and (2) supplementing current campaign models to increase efficacy and transferability. This preliminary work suggests future research that could involve fitting this model with data.},

	abstract = {The highly endemic native fish fauna has experienced dramatic reductions in abundance and range because of anthropogenic activity.  In addition to a highly altered flow, temperature, and physical habitat template, many non-native fish species have established populations throughout the basin.  The San Rafael River, a tributary of the Green River in southeastern Utah, is home to populations of flannelmouth sucker (Catostomus latipinnis), bluehead sucker (C. discobolus), and roundtail chub (Gila robusta), and has experienced degradations representative of many rivers throughout the Colorado River Basin.  Using the San Rafael River as a template, I examined (1) the effect of the non-native fishes on the food web structure of a Colorado River tributary and (2) whether any changes to the food web structure by non-native fishes impact fitness-related vital rates of native fishes in the river.  Stable isotope analysis revealed that the non-native fishes present novel predator archetypes to the "three species," but size-at-age and body condition analyses did not reveal any reduction in fitness between native fishes captured in the presence of the non-native fishes.     Additionally, I used site-specific biotic and abiotic measurements to develop a model predicting "three species" relative abundance.  Non-native fish abundance and spatially auto-correlated measures of physical habitat were found to be particularly important predictors of "three species" relative abundance.  The model was used in combination with a longitudinal habitat survey to predict the current continuous distribution along the length of the lower San Rafael River, as well as to simulate population-level effects of relevant restoration actions.  The eradication of non-native fishes resulted in significant population increases for each of the 'three species,' and physical habitat restoration resulted in significant population increases when executed in certain reaches, but significant population reductions if executed in other reaches.  These results suggest that the restoration of physical habitat without addressing populations of non-native fishes will likely result in a limited response by the "three species," and that the choice of restoration location is critical to its success.},

	abstract = {Dreissenid bivalves, Dreissena polymorpha (zebra mussel) and Dreissena bugensis (quagga mussel) are biofouling species that invaded the Great Lakes region of North America from source populations in Europe in the 1980s. Initially, D. polymorpha spread faster and farther; however, D. bugensis have recently displaced D. polymorpha in many areas of the Great Lakes and was the first to be found west of the Continental Divide. Early detection of dreissenids is important in anticipating and preventing potentially high economic impacts. To study population dynamics and to enhance detection methods, we assessed “spawnability” using a serotonin bioassay and developed a new, sensitive, multiplex PCR method to identify veligers and verify adult species. Contrasting riverine populations were identified in the Saginaw River (100\% D. polymorpha) and the Detroit River at Belle Isle (100\% D. bugensis in 2010), and mixed populations of mussels (10\% to ∼50\% D. polymorpha) were found in Saginaw Bay, Lake Huron. In 1994, when the Detroit River population at Belle Isle was virtually all D. polymorpha (Ram et al. 1996), spawning could not be induced by serotonin until late May, and peak spawnability did not occur until early June. In 2010, D. bugensis at the same site could be induced to spawn in the first week of April, and reached near maximal spawning intensity by mid‐May. In 2010, Detroit River veligers were first observed in April and, by PCR species‐specific detection, were 100\% D. bugensis. Veligers changed to a mixed population of both species later in May and rose to a peak, mixed population in early June. These experiments demonstrate a quantitative, species‐specific detection of dreissenid veligers, and lay the groundwork for determining the role of early reproduction and other mechanisms in mediating the displacement of one species by a closely related “cousin.”},

Here, we present an example of a substantial change in the impact of an alien species that appeared more than a decade after initial invasion. We studied an invasion of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) into the Hudson River (New York, USA) over a 22 year period (1987–2008) including five years of pre‐invasion observations. Zebra mussels caused a substantial and sustained decline in phytoplankton, and until recently, zooplankton. However from 2005–2008, the abundance of copepods, copepod nauplii, and rotifers recovered while tintinnid ciliates partially recovered. These changes are consistent with an increased mortality of larger ({\textgreater} 20 mm) zebra mussels that has altered the filter‐feeding impact of the population. Large mussels had a threshold relationship with the abundance of nauplii, rotifers, and zebra mussel veligers suppressing these microzooplankton when filtration by large mussels was {\textgreater} 0.5 m3 m−2 d−1. Zooplankton biomass declined approximately 50\% after the zebra mussel invasion but has recovered to pre‐invasion levels. Overall, while zebra mussels are still present and abundant in the Hudson River, their impact on zooplankton has significantly diminished.},

	abstract = {The degree to which invasive species have altered the demography, ranges, and microhabitat occupation of native species is poorly known. Yet, the competitionmediated decline of native populations, in concert with other factors such as habitat degradation, can place native species at risk of extirpation. Understanding whether competition between native and non-native species can take place under ordinary environmental conditions can allow us to extrapolate whether native species are likely to have experienced harm in the past and/or if they are likely to do so in the future. The native slug Philomycus carolinianus is likely to compete for resources with the aggressive non-native slug Arion subfuscus in central Maryland forests. In order to establish whether competition occurs between these two species, I tested for the following criteria: the existence of competitive displacement in the field, overlap in the use of limited resources (shelter and food), a decline in the fitness of P. carolinianus in the presence of A. subfuscus, and the action of competition mechanisms (interference and exploitation) between them. Field surveys showed that displacement between A. subfuscus and P. carolinianus does not apparently occur within mixed natural populations. Resource use of the two slugs overlapped, with part of the diet (i.e. fungus) and a large proportion of the microhabitats occupied (i.e. coarse woody debris) in common. A lab experiment established that low natural levels of food (fungus) can limit the fitness of each slug species, while shelter (coarse woody debris) was not limiting. When sharing a low-resource lab cage with either A. subfuscus or conspecifics, P. carolinianus experienced a similar decline in fitness, suggesting that exploitative resource competition was no greater between heterospecifics than between conspecifics. No evidence of heterospecific interference (competition independent of resource levels) was found. Given the limited support for the criteria of competition,  A. subfuscus was not shown to be an immediate threat to the persistence of P. carolinianus.},

	abstract = {The surf scoter, Melanitta perspicillata, is a declining sea duck species that relies on multiple habitats for wintering, breeding, and migrating. Conservation of this species may depend on understanding and protecting networks of critical habitats, including those in urban estuaries. I examined habitat use and movements of scoters at several spatial and temporal scales, and evaluated the influence of an invasive species on diet, contaminant accumulation, and body condition, focusing particularly on birds wintering in San Francisco Bay (SFB).      I compared spring migration routes, chronology, and stop-over sites among satellite-marked surf scoters from four wintering estuaries along the Pacific coast. Eighty-three percent of scoters followed two distinct routes to the breeding area. Route choice was related to nesting site latitude in the Canadian Northern Boreal Forest.  Scoters had strong route fidelity, but altered chronology and stopovers between years.  Departure date varied by wintering site, but arrival and apparent settling dates were synchronous.     I modeled relationships between environmental variables and scoter occurrence and density, and determined distributions and movements of radio-marked surf scoters in SFB. Herring roe was the strongest predictor of scoter presence and density; however salinity, depth, and eelgrass presence also ranked highly. Scoters restricted their movements and used small areas within the marine Central Bay later in winter, potentially related to prey depletion elsewhere.       I evaluated the role of an invasive bivalve, Corbula amurensis , in nutrient acquisition and contaminant accumulation in SFB surf scoters.  Scoter diets were dominated by Corbula in the northern estuary, and Japanese littleneck clam, Venerupis philipinarium, and Pacific herring, Clupea pallasi, roe in the Central Bay.  Scoter lipids were negatively correlated to δ15Nplasma and positively correlated to δ 13Cmuscle, suggesting bivalves contributed more to lipid acquisition than other prey, and scoters foraging on Venerupis versus Corbula attained higher lipids.  Selenium concentrations were similar between Corbula and Venerupis.  Stable isotope mixing models indicated higher selenium concentrations in North Bay scoters were related to the proportion but not the species of bivalves in diet.  I found little effect of selenium, cadmium or total mercury on scoter lipid or protein content.},

Model parameters were derived by laboratory evaluation of consumption and respiration rates from 14 to 32°C and fish size ranging from 19 to 400 g. The model was calibrated with laboratory growth and consumption data, and model performance was analyzed to evaluate the parameters most sensitive to error. The optimal temperature for lionfish consumption is 29.8°C. Energy allocated to gamete production reduces female lionfish growth rate compared to males and limits maximum body size. Based on the environmental conditions and observed growth, daily consumption estimates of 393 lionfish ˙ ha-1 could remove up to 2.186 kg prey ˙ d-1 during the summer in the Bahamas.

	abstract = {Background  
Invasive species are a serious problem in ecosystems, but are difficult to eradicate once established. Predictive methods can be key in determining which areas are of concern regarding invasion by such species to prevent establishment [1]. We assessed the geographic potential of four Eurasian cyprinid fishes (common carp, tench, grass carp, black carp) as invaders in North America via ecological niche modeling (ENM). These “carp” represent four stages of invasion of the continent (a long-established invader with a wide distribution, a long-established invader with a limited distribution, a spreading invader whose distribution is expanding, and a newly introduced potential invader that is not yet established), and as such illustrate the progressive reduction of distributional disequilibrium over the history of species' invasions.
Methodology/Principal Findings
We used ENM to estimate the potential distributional area for each species in North America using models based on native range distribution data. Environmental data layers for native and introduced ranges were imported from state, national, and international climate and environmental databases. Models were evaluated using independent validation data on native and invaded areas. We calculated omission error for the independent validation data for each species: all native range tests were highly successful (all omission values {\textless}7\%); invaded-range predictions were predictive for common and grass carp (omission values 8.8 and 19.8\%, respectively). Model omission was high for introduced tench populations (54.7\%), but the model correctly identified some areas where the species has been successful; distributional predictions for black carp show that large portions of eastern North America are at risk.
Conclusions/Significance
ENMs predicted potential ranges of carp species accurately even in regions where the species have not been present until recently. ENM can forecast species' potential geographic ranges with reasonable precision and within the short screening time required by proposed U.S. invasive species legislation.},

	abstract = {Background  
Elemental imbalances of carbon (C): nitrogen (N): phosphorus (P) ratios in food resources can constrain the growth of grazers owning to tight coupling between growth rate, RNA allocation and biomass P content in animals. Testing for stoichiometric constraints among invasive species is a novel challenge in invasion ecology to unravel how a successful invader tackles ecological barriers in novel ecosystems.
Methodology/Principal Findings
We examined the C∶P and N∶P ratios and the condition factor of a successful invader in lakes, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), collected from two Swedish lakes. Concurrently, we analyzed the elemental composition of the food (seston) and tissue of the mussels in which nutrient composition of food and mussels varied over time. Zebra mussel condition factor was weakly related to the their own tissue N∶P and C∶P ratios, although the relation with the later ratio was not significant. Smaller mussels had relatively lower tissue N∶P ratio and higher condition factor. There was no difference in C∶P and N∶P ratios between seston and mussels' tissues. Our results indicated that the variation in nutrient stoichiometry of zebra mussels can be explained by food quality and quantity.
Conclusions/Significance
Our study suggests that fitness of invasive zebra mussels is not constrained by nutrient stoichiometry which is likely to be important for their proliferation in novel ecosystems. The lack of imbalance in C∶P and N∶P ratios between seston and mussels along with high tissue C∶P ratio of the mussel allow them to tolerate potential P limitation and maintain high growth rate. Moreover, zebra mussels are able to change their tissue C∶P and N∶P ratios in response to the variation in elemental composition of their food. This can also help them to bypass potential nutrient stoichiometric constraints. Our finding is an important step towards understanding the mechanisms contributing to the success of exotic species from stoichiometric principles.},

While there may be countless vectors of transportation for these species, it remains a fact that transient recreational boating is the primary mechanism of overland dispersal. This regional study is the current representation (2008) of the specific pattern of spread among waterbodies that will be experienced in the Southwestern region of the United States, should the Zebra/Quagga mussel show up via recreational boating. This study has fully examined the greater details involved in the travel and tourism of recreational boaters in SW US from the exquisite vantage point of Lake Powell. It has been determined that regional expansion of the Zebra/Quagga mussel will likely continue in the area due careless recreational boating practices. Without the knowledge of the spatial patterns of dispersal, regional non-indigenous species prevention and management strategies will be lost and the Colorado River will thus disperse the mussel throughout the entire region. With the combined efforts of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area prevention partners and the different jurisdictions commitment to funding enforcement, Lake Powell has become a major influence of knowledge and authority for other agencies who have only just begun to develop a defense plan. By and large, the results of this study represent the pervasive threat of a complete invasion that lingers over Lake Powell, the Colorado River Drainage Basin, and the entire region.},

	abstract = {This research addresses the relationship between environmental conditions, ecological patterns, and physiological stress characteristics in two eastern Pacific mussel congeners, Mytilus galloprovincialis  and Mytilus trossulus. While M. trossulus  is native to the region, M. galloprovincialis is an invasive species introduced to the eastern Pacific nearly a century ago. The two species overlap in range and compete for resources in central California, but species abundances are largely segregated across habitats and latitude. It is thought that differential environmental tolerances may play a significant role in setting the distributions of these species.   Using a combination of field surveys and molecular laboratory analyses, this research correlated environmental conditions with physiological functioning to identify how evolved tolerances map on to ecological patterns. Results support the hypothesis that M. galloprovincialis and  M. trossulus differ in their environmental tolerances. The native species exhibited more cool-adapted and euryhaline traits, while the invader suggested a more stenohaline and warm-adapted physiology. These differences were observed in stress response profiles across seasons, habitats, and laboratory acclimations. In Bodega Bay, CA, field surveys also showed the two species to segregate across littoral zones, a pattern which had not previously been reported and has significant implications for future monitoring of these species.    An analysis of field condition across latitude was also undertaken using  M. galloprovincialis, intended to measure the extent and nature of acclimatization patterns across large spatial scales. The study found  M. galloprovincialis to vary in standing stocks of stress proteins across sites, correlated with relative water temperatures in each region. The relationship between constitutive stress proteins and the inducible "heat shock" response was also explored and results suggested that constitutive proteins may provide a protective role in high-stress environments.   These studies collectively help to characterize the physiological traits that may underlie many of the distribution patterns observed between M. galloprovincialis and M. trossulus. By considering questions of ecology and individual functioning within the context of one another, these types of macro-physiological studies may inform our understanding of the M. galloprovincialis invasion, and perhaps also address larger ecological questions such as species ranges, competition, and responses of organisms to climate change.},

	abstract = {The historical spatio-temporal distribution of invasive species is rarely documented, hampering efforts to understand invasion dynamics, especially at regional scales. Reconstructing historical invasions through use of herbarium records combined with spatial trend analysis and modeling can elucidate spreading patterns and identify susceptible habitats before invasion occurs. Two perennial species were chosen to contrast historic and potential phytogeographies: Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum), introduced intentionally across the US; and mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris), introduced largely accidentally to coastal areas. Spatial analysis revealed that early in the invasion, both species have a stochastic distribution across the contiguous US, but east of the 90th meridian, which approximates the Mississippi River, quickly spread to adjacent counties in subsequent decades. In contrast, in locations west of the 90th meridian, many populations never spread outside the founding county, probably a result of encountering unfavorable environmental conditions. Regression analysis using variables categorized as environmental or anthropogenic accounted for 24\% (Japanese knotweed) and 30\% (mugwort) of the variation in the current distribution of each species. Results show very few counties with high habitat suitability (≥80\%) remain un-invaded (5 for Japanese knotweed and 6 for mugwort), suggesting these perennials are reaching the limits of large-scale expansion. Despite differences in initial introduction loci and pathways, Japanese knotweed and mugwort demonstrate similar historic patterns of spread and show declining rates of regional expansion. Invasion mitigation efforts should be concentrated on areas identified as highly susceptible that border invaded regions, as both species demonstrate secondary expansion from introduction loci.},

	abstract = {Many ecological models quantify patterns that result from biological processes, extrapolate the patterns to make predictions into the future, and infer causality. These models describe the results of biological processes but are limited in understanding the interactions within the system. However, many ecological processes are complex systems comprised of many heterogeneous components that learn and adapt to a changing landscape that create patterns as emergent properties from individual decisions. This dissertation proposes a generic framework of how biological processes work. From this framework a modeler can capture biological processes by explicitly modeling time, space, and the essence of the decision making of the components of a biological process to understand causality.    Three models are presented exploring the continuum of capturing biological realism. The first explores the potential effects the doubling of CO 2 will have on four wildlife species. Through a logistic regression, the model quantifies current wildlife distribution patterns and projects these characteristics onto the changed landscape after the doubling of CO2 . Causality is inferred and little is understood of the biological interactions.    The second model places virtual moose onto a Geographic Information System (GIS) landscape and based on a series of physiological characteristics the moose select the optimum activity budget to maximize fitness within the landscape. The model simulates space and the decision making in a more biological realistic manner than the first model, but time is generalized.    The third model is agent-based in which virtual cougars are placed in a GIS landscape and make tradeoffs each time step as they move through the landscape. The tradeoffs include hunting, mating, and remaining safe. The model explicitly models time, space, and the essence of a cougar decision making thus modeling in a more biological realistic manner.    Due to the magnitude and speed at which change is now occurring, models based on observations that quantify and describe processes and patterns and attempt to replicate these processes may no longer suffice. In order to predict the success or survival of the ecological elements in these new situations, we must understand the mechanisms that drive the elements.},

	abstract = {ALGAE AND CYANOBACTRIA IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS is a unique collection of essays, contributed by leading scientists from around the world, devoted to algae - and some related microbes - observed in unexpected harsh habits, which it seems are an oasis or Garden of Eden for these organisms. This timely book on Extremophilic alga, including its especially impressive micrographs, may provide clues about the edges of life on Earth and possibly elsewhere in the universe. 
Defining locations from the anthropomorphic point of view, the environments explored ranges from severe and distant to "normal" places. The algae discussed, microbial oxygenic phototrophs, are classified into various categories according to their habitats. They thrive in various temperature ranges, at the limits of pH values, in salt solutions, under UV radiation, dryness, heavy metals, anaerobic niches, under various levels of illuminations, and under hydrostatic pressure. Authors discuss bio-diversely algal territories ecologically - the hot springs with the thermophiles or acido-thermophiles; Antarctica, the Artic, and permafrost zones with their cold lovers (Psychrophiles); soda lakes with the alkaliphiles, saltine areas with halophiles. In addition to general essays, Algal species discussed in detail include diatoms, Cyanidium, Galdieria, Dunaliella, and Chroococcidiopsis.
This volume is a must for students of the field of biodiversity, as well as those in Phycology, ecology and general biological research.Invaluable collection of essays on the life of extremophilic algae Unique reading about algae living at the edge of life Leading scientists' contributions cover all aspects of algae in servere habitats Modern science knowledge of phototrophic microbes Impressive photos and micrographs of various algae},

A 1993 demonstration project showed that substrate and habitat modifications with a wind-break attracted fish nesting and juvenile fishes. The subsequent installation of a permanent wind-break at a site with a wetland re-connection in 2001 resulted in increased wetland-like habitat, reduced diversity and numbers of macroinvertebrates and had inconclusive results for fishes. Analysis of nest and juvenile fish data for Lepomis spp., largemouth and smallmouth bass found relationships between habitat and densities of nests and juvenile fish. Maps were generated to identify locations of the highest densities of nests and juveniles for use in lake restoration efforts. The construction of more habitat modules is not recommended.},

	abstract = {Stream flow is a major vector for zebra mussel spread among inland lakes. I hypothesized that vegetated waterways, i.e. wetland streams, would hinder downstream dispersal of zebra mussels in connected inland lake systems. To test this hypothesis, veliger (larva) abundance, recruitment, and adult mussels were surveyed in four lake-wetland systems in southeastern Michigan, USA from May through August 2006. Sampling was conducted downstream of the zebra mussel invaded lakes, beginning at the upstream edge of aquatic vegetation and continuing downstream through the wetland streams. Results showed that veliger abundance decreased rapidly in vegetated waterways compared to their previously reported rates of decrease in non-vegetated streams. Veligers were rarely found more than 1 km downstream from where vegetation began. Newly recruited individuals and adults were extremely rare beyond open water in the study systems. These results suggest that densely vegetated aquatic ecosystems limit the dispersal of zebra mussels downstream from invaded sources. Natural, remediated and constructed wetlands may therefore serve as a protective barrier to help prevent the spread of zebra mussels and other aquatic invasive species to other lakes and ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Herein, I describe research that quantifies how native and non-native (henceforth exotic) benthic organisms influence community and ecosystem processes. As aquatic ecosystems are recovering from years of excessive inputs of nutrients and industrial pollution, the influence of benthic food webs on the overall ecosystem likely will increase. By conducting a series of laboratory and outdoor experiments, observational studies, and field assessments in small reservoirs, I quantified how benthic organisms transfer material to higher trophic levels. For the native omnivore, gizzard shad Dorosoma cepedianum, growth and survival depended on the quality of sediment detritus, suggesting that detritus quality ultimately can regulate community and ecosystem productivity, mediated by its influence on gizzard shad biomass available for trophic transfer to piscivorous fish (Chapter 2). The addition of an exotic, benthic fish, round goby Neogobius melanostomus to the Lake Erie ecosystem, by being preferentially consumed over native prey by smallmouth bass  Micropterus dolomieu appears to transfer benthic energy and contaminants to the pelagic food web (Chapter 3). A field study and historical data in Lake Erie revealed biomagnification of PCBs by an exotic species component (comprising round goby and dreissenid mussels Dreissena spp.) to native terminal predators, smallmouth bass and largemouth bass  Micropterus salmoides (Chapter 4). Recovering benthic macroinvertebrate communities in Lake Erie appear influenced by dreissenid mussels and dreissenid mussel interactions with PCBs and organic content of sediments (Chapter 5). As nutrient and contaminant inputs continue to decline and exotic species continue to proliferate, I predict an increase in the relative importance of such benthic transfer pathways in influencing variability in transfer of energy and contaminants from to the pelagic food web.},

	abstract = {Distinct changes have occurred in the size and composition of the spring phytoplankton community in the eastern basin of Lake Erie following the introduction of Dreissena. Since 1996, total phytoplankton biovolume has decreased to approximately 20\% of pre-Dreissena levels, whereas postinvasion concentrations of spring soluble nutrients, particularly silica, have been substantially elevated compared with earlier years. Spring dominance has shifted from a mix of pennate and large centric diatoms and pyrrophytes to three centric diatoms with high silica requirements: Aulacoseira islandica, Stephanodiscus hantzschii, and Stephanodiscus parvus, and the overall diversity and species richness of the spring phytoplankton community has declined significantly. In addition, current April silica concentrations are approximately twice as high as historical (i.e., 1960s-1980s) winter maxima, indicating that the silica content of the lake has increased since the dreissenid invasion. These results suggest that the severe silica depletion caused by increased anthropogenic inputs of nutrients during the last century has been mitigated through a decrease in diatom production, most likely brought about by dreissenid grazing.

Denitrification assays were amended with nutrients to characterize variation in nutrient limitation of denitrification in the presence or absence of zebra mussels. Denitrification rates at zebra mussel sites were high relative to sites without zebra mussels in February 2004 (repeated measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA), p = 0.005), potentially because of high NO{\textasciicircum}sub 3{\textasciicircum}{\textasciicircum}sup -{\textasciicircum}-N variability from nitrification of high NH{\textasciicircum}sub 4{\textasciicircum}{\textasciicircum}sup +{\textasciicircum} zebra mussel waste.

Denitrification was always N-limited, but sites without zebra mussels showed the strongest response to N amendments relative to sites with zebra mussels (two-way ANOVA, p ≤ 0.01).

This view prevails even though honey is the oldest wound dressing known to medicine, with recorded use back to the time of the Egyptians.

	abstract = {Twenty sites along the St. Lawrence River were sampled to determine if the distribution and abundance of invasive mussels (zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga mussel (Dreissena bugensis)) are explained by physicochemical variables. Calcium concentration, substrate size, and depth independently explained significant proportions of variation in biomass for both species. Zebra mussel populations occurred at calcium levels as low as 8 mg Ca.L{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}, but quagga mussels were absent below 12 mg Ca.L{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}, suggesting that they have higher calcium requirements. Both species increased in biomass with increasing substrate size but displayed contrasting patterns with depth. Using combinations of these environmental variables, we developed stepwise multiple regression models to predict zebra mussel biomass and quagga mussel biomass. The zebra mussel model included calcium concentration, substrate size, and depth (r{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} = 0.36, P {\textless} 0.0001), while the quagga mussel model included only substrate size and depth (r{\textasciicircum}sup 2{\textasciicircum} = 0.32, P {\textless} 0.0001). These results suggest that dreissenid mussel abundance (and correlated impacts) will vary predictably across environmental gradients, but the same predictive model will not be accurate for both species.

Stable-isotope ratios ({\textasciicircum}sup 15{\textasciicircum}N/{\textasciicircum}sup 14{\textasciicircum}N and {\textasciicircum}sup 13{\textasciicircum}CV{\textasciicircum}sup 12{\textasciicircum}C) were used to identify likely food sources and estimate relative trophic position. For Lake Erie, stable-isotope ratios indicated no diet differences between the two mussel species. For all lakes, zooplankton δ{\textasciicircum}sup 13{\textasciicircum}C was indicative of phytoplanktivory. The {\textasciicircum}sup 13{\textasciicircum}C stable isotope ratios indicated that seston comprised {\textasciitilde}50\% of food sources for mussels in Lake Erie, but 73\%-97\% and 52\%-100\% of the diet of mussel populations in Lake Wawasee and Clark Lake, respectively. Stable nitrogen isotope ratios placed zooplankton at trophic levels equal to or higher than those of mussels in seven of eight comparisons. Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis are able to exploit suspended detritus as a significant energy source, as well as compete directly with zooplankton for seston as a food source and with each other in areas of sympatry.

	abstract = {Conservation biologists and other environmentalists confront five obstacles in building support for regulatory policies that seek to exclude or remove introduced plants and other non-native species that threaten to harm natural areas or the natural environment. First, the concept of "harm to the natural environment" is nebulous and undefined. Second, ecologists cannot predict how introduced species will behave in natural ecosystems. If biologists cannot define "harm" or predict the behavior of introduced species, they must target all non-native species as potentially "harmful." an impossibly large regulatory task. Third, loss of species richness may constitute harm to an environment, but introduced organisms typically, generally, and significantly add to species richness in ecosystems. If species richness correlates with desirable ecosystem properties, moreover, such as stability and productivity, as some ecologists believe, then introduced organisms, by increasing species richness, would support those desirable properties. Fourth, one may plausibly argue that extinction constitutes environmental harm, but there is no evidence that non-native species, especially plants, are significant causes of extinction, except for predators in certain lakes and other small island-like environments. Fifth, while aesthetic, ethical, and spiritual values may provide a legitimate basis for invasive species policy, biologists often cite concepts such as "biodiversity" and ecosystem "health" or "integrity" to provide a scientific justification. To assert that non-native species threaten biodiversity or undermine ecosystem health, however, may be to draw conceptual entailments or consequences from definitions of "biodiversity" and "integrity" that arbitrarily exclude non-native species or make the presence of exotic species a per se indicator of decline.

	abstract = {Large numbers of the filter-feeding larval stage of zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) (veligers) have been advected into the estuarine transition zone (ETZ) of the St. Lawrence River. In 1994, they became the dominant member of the tidal freshwater zooplankton assemblage of the ETZ (and subsequently the true estuarine assemblage) during summer months. These changes in community structure have not, however, been reflected in changes in the abundance of preinvasion taxa. Abundance of potential planktonic competitors such as rotifers and the cladoceran Bosmina longirostris fluctuated between years but did not decline following the invasion. Only densities of the copepod Eurytemora affinis declined in 2000 and 2001, but this could not be definitively associated with the invasion. Synchronous variation among different zooplankton groups suggests that environmental forcing related to or correlated with temperature anomalies is the major cause of interannual variation in the abundance of zooplankton taxa. The negative correlation between veliger abundance and salinity indicates that the ETZ acts as a sink for the larval stages of the zebra mussel. Their precise fate remains uncertain, but our study suggests that this invasion has had little or no impact on this pelagic community in spite of the numerical dominance of veligers.

	abstract = {The potential transfer of heavy metals via trophic transfer (bioaccumulation) in global aquatic ecosystems is of growing concern amongst members of today's society. Therefore it is important to examine contaminated ecosystems beginning with the organisms that have the highest potential for exposure. Bivalve species have traditionally been considered excellent biomonitors of metal levels in marine environments. My research examines the combined influences of abiotic (salinity, ecosystem quality) and biotic factors (food quality and selection) on heavy metal uptake and availability in the West coast blue mussel Mytilus trossulus.    Flow-through (48) and pulse-feeding (66) experiments were conducted using either single or combinations of marine bacteria, phytoplankton, natural sediments and clay food sources. Flow-through experiments involved feeding  M. trossulus a marine bacterium containing non-radioactive Mn, Cd, or Pb oxides and varying amounts of carbon. Bacteria containing higher amounts of carbon had enhanced metal uptake due to an increased clearance rate of the organic rich particles. Pulse-feeding experiments involved feeding  M. trossulus combinations of radiolabelled 109Cd phytoplankton, clay and natural sediments containing varying amounts of carbon. To obtain natural, biologically-relevant sediments unique intertidal sediment traps were designed and deployed at two estuarine habitats. The sediment quality and salinity of these habitats (Boundary Bay and Deep Bay) differed significantly (24\% C and 25 ppt vs. 15\% C and 15 ppt., respectively). Results indicated that lower salinity environments may result in significantly lower dietary cadmium uptake and assimilation efficiencies in M. trossulus when compared to higher salinity environments.    My research demonstrated that the active selection of food particles by M. trossulus significantly affected the extent of metal uptake and assimilation. In addition, the bioaccumulation of metals by  M. trossulus inhabiting different marine habitats varied depending on the natural abiotic conditions within that habitat, such as salinity. I conclude that using M. trossulus as a biomonitor of marine metal levels is useful so long as the feeding behaviour and abiotic habitat parameters are considered when comparing metal levels in M. trossulus  between different habitats.},

	abstract = {We used an individual-based bioenergetic model to simulate the phosphorus flux of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) population in central Lake Erie during 1995-2002. Estimates of round goby diet composition, growth rates, and population abundance were derived from field sampling. As an abundant introduced fish, we predicted that round gobies would influence phosphorus cycling both directly, through excretion, and indirectly, through consumption of dreissenid mussels, whose high mass-specific phosphorus excretion enhances recycling. In 1999, when age-1+ round gobies reached peak abundance near 350 million (2.4 kg.ha{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}), annual phosphorus excretion was estimated at 7 t (1.4 × 10{\textasciicircum}sup -3{\textasciicircum} mg P.m{\textasciicircum}sup -2{\textasciicircum}.day{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}). From an ecosystem perspective, however, round gobies excreted only 0.4\% of the phosphorus needed by the benthic community for primary production. Indirectly, round gobies consumed {\textless}0.2\% of dreissenid population biomass, indicating that round gobies did not reduce nutrient availability by consuming dreissenids. Compared with previous studies that have revealed introduced species to influence phosphorus cycling, round gobies likely did not attain a sufficiently high biomass density to influence phosphorus cycling in Lake Erie.

	abstract = {Despite predictions that the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion of North America would damage fisheries, analyses of actual effects on fish have been few and equivocal. We analyze 26 years of data on fish populations in the Hudson River to quantify changes associated with the zebra mussel invasion. Based on our measurements of changes in the lower food web, we predicted that populations of open-water fish species (e.g., Alosa spp.) would suffer and populations of littoral fish species (e.g., Centrarchidae) would prosper from the zebra mussel invasion. We found that the median decrease in abundance of open-water species was 28\%, whereas the median increase in abundance of littoral species was 97\%. Populations of open-water species shifted downriver away from the zebra mussel population, whereas those of littoral species shifted upriver. Median apparent growth rates fell by 17\% among open-water species and rose by 12\% in the single littoral species studied. Many of the observed changes were large and involved species of commercial or recreational importance (e.g., American shad (Alosa sapidissima), black basses (Micropterus spp.)). The influence of zebra mussels on fish should vary widely across ecosystems as a function of system morphology, factors that limit primary production, and diets of the fish species.

Chlorophyll a, other limnological variables, and Zooplankton abundance and biomass (including copepod nauplii and rotifers) were monitored over time. During their first 2 weeks of life, larval fish reared in the presence of mussels grew 24\% more slowly than fish reared alone. Differential growth rates can be explained by competition between mussels and bluegill for food in the form of microzooplankton. Also likely was an indirect competition via starvation of the Zooplankton community as zebra mussels consumed phytoplankton. Either direct or indirect trophic competition between zebra mussels and obligate planktivores may result in ecological harm as zebra mussels spread throughout inland lakes of North America.

Since 1994, Dreissena polymorpha veligers have become the dominant Zooplankton (up to 260 individuals-L{\textasciicircum}sup -1{\textasciicircum}). The environmental factors controlling their distribution across the ETZ and their potential impact on the plankton were determined. Their horizontal distribution was limited by salinity, with maximum decreases in concentration at 2[per thousand]. A sharp decline in prey availability at {\textgreater}2[per thousand] may be a secondary Stressor for the veligers, in addition to the direct effects of salinity. Their vertical distribution was homogeneous throughout the water column, even in the presence of a pycnocline. Redundancy analysis showed that veliger concentrations were positively correlated with temperature and turbidity and negatively correlated with salinity and total phosphorus. Veligers were also positively correlated with chlorophyll a and picophytoplankton concentrations, suggesting little effect on their phytoplankton prey. Moreover, the veligers were positively correlated with the sestonic ratio of paniculate to total phosphorus, indicating their positive association with good food quality. The veligers appear to have no severe negative impacts on the ETZ plankton community and are restricted to favourable conditions for their survival in the upstream, low salinity region of the ETZ.

Between May and August, I measured respiration (1998), shell growth of marked mussels suspended in cages in the lake (1999-2000), soft body mass and mass of gametes released (1998-2001), and the number of gametes released by individual mussels (1999). Quagga mussels had lower respiration rates and greater shell growth and body mass. There was no difference in the percentage of spawning mussels or the number of sperm released by individuals, but zebra mussels generally released more eggs and a greater mass of gametes than did quagga mussels. Similar reproduction at a lower body mass indicates that zebra mussels devote a greater proportion of body tissue to reproduction. Lower respiration rates and larger size give quagga mussels a competitive advantage and may explain their displacement of zebra mussels.},

	abstract = {We describe, explain, and "predict" dispersal and ecosystem impacts of six Ponto-Caspian endemic species that recently invaded the Great Lakes via ballast water. The zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, and quagga mussel, Dreissena bugensis, continue to colonize hard and soft substrates of the Great Lakes and are changing ecosystem function through mechanisms of ecosystem engineering (increased water clarity and reef building), fouling native mussels, high particle filtration rate with selective rejection of colonial cyanobacteria in pseudofeces, alteration of nutrient ratios, and facilitation of the rapid spread of their Ponto-Caspian associates, the benthic amphipod Echinogammarus ischnus and the round goby, Neogobius melanostomus, which feeds on zebra mussels. The tubenose goby, Proterorhinus marmoratus, which does not feed on zebra mussels, has not spread rapidly. Impacts of these benthic invaders vary with site: in some shallow areas, habitat changes and the Dreissena to round goby to piscivore food chain have improved conditions for certain native game fishes and waterfowl; in offshore waters, Dreissena is competing for settling algae with the native amphipod Diporeia spp., which are disappearing to the detriment of the native deep-water fish community. The predatory cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi may compete with small fishes for zooplankton and increase food-chain length.},

This hypothesis was evaluated for invasive aquatic species in North America, particularly Asian clams, Corbicula fluminea, and zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha. Both species have rapid growth, early maturity, short life spans, and elevated fecundity, allowing rapid population recovery after reductions by rarefractive, environmental extremes. Extensive resistance capacities offer little adaptive value to invasive, r-selected species, because population reductions occur in their unstable habitats regardless of degree of stress tolerance. Thus, both species have relatively poor physiologic resistance, depending instead on elevated growth and fecundity for rapid population recovery. In contrast, native North American bivalve species are often adapted to stable habitats where perturbation is infrequent (i.e., freshwater unionoidean bivalves). They are characterized by slow growth, extended life spans, and low effective fecundities, slowing population recoveries (K-selected), and have evolved extensive resistance adaptations to avoid extirpation during environmental extremes. Review of resistance adaptations in other North American aquatic invaders revealed poorer or equivalent physiological tolerance relative to taxonomically related native species, suggesting that extensive physiological tolerance is not required for invasive success.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) in Lake Champlain have colonized the shells of many native unionids, causing declines in their abundance. Periodically cleaning zebra mussels from unionids may be an effective conservation technique, if unionids can recover from the stress induced by zebra mussels. Efforts will need to target species that are most vulnerable to fouling and subsequent energetic losses. We used glycogen as a biochemical indicator of energetic stores to assess species-specific differences in tolerance to zebra mussels. There was no evidence that glycogen levels decreased as dreissenid/unionid mass ratios increased in Elliptio complanata. However, dreissenid/ unionid mass ratios as low as 0.25 in Lampsilis radiata were correlated with a significant decline in glycogen content. The ability of these species to recover glycogen after zebra mussel removal and replacement in situ was also evaluated. Mussels were cleaned of zebra mussels and replaced in situ. After 10 weeks, cleaned, heavily fouled, and never-fouled (control) mussels were collected. Glycogen levels in fouled mussels were lower than in the control mussels, while glycogen levels in cleaned mussels did not differ from the control mussels. Results suggest that heavily fouled               The relationship between the magnitude of zebra mussel fouling and glycogen content was determined for E. complanata and L. radiata in Lake Champlain, Vt. These two species are the most abundant unionids in Lake Champlain (Fiske and Levy 1996). The magnitude of fouling was expressed using the dreissenid/unionid mass ratio (Ricciardi et al. 1996), which was determined by dividing the blotted wet mass of the removed zebra mussels by the blotted wet mass of the unionid. Dreissenid/unionid mass ratios were obtained using 56 E. complanata and 92 L. radiata during the 1st week of July from Button Bay. An additional 29 E. complanata and 18 L. radiata were collected for glycogen analysis from Button Bay during the first 2 weeks of August 1997, using SCUBA (Fig. 1). Collections were made 100 m west of the boating access ramp in 0.5-1.5 m of water. Efforts were made to collect unionids that exhibited a range of zebra mussel fouling. Unionids were sacrificed after zebra mussel removal and a sample of mantle tissue, lining the mantle cavity, was removed. We examined the relationship between observed dreissenid/unionid mass ratios and glycogen content with a Spearman's rank correlation (Zar 1984). After plotting glycogen data, a post hoc analysis was used to determine the fouling threshold at which glycogen content began to significantly decline. A Welch's t test was used to examine differences between selected groups.               To determine the ability of L. radiata and E. complanata to recover glycogen after zebra mussel removal, a cleaning experiment was performed at the Lewis Creek delta on July 15, 1997, in an area where heavily fouled mussels were observed (Fig. 1). The experimental area was located 100 m west of the mouth. SCUBA was used to collect 35 heavily fouled E. complanata and 35 L. radiata individuals from the sand-silt substrate in 1-2 m of water. All zebra mussels were removed and each unionid shell was thoroughly scrubbed with a small brush. The dreissenid/unionid mass ratio was obtained for each cleaned unionid. Mussels were individually marked by scribing through the periostracum with a dental pick. The mussels were replaced in a 4-m2 open-topped chicken wire pen that was secured to the substrate with eight rebar stakes. The diameter of the chicken wire (25 mm) and open top allowed normal water flow through the area. The pen was inspected every 2 weeks for dead mussels. All mussels were removed from the pen on September 30, 1997, and an equivalent number of zebra mussel fouled unionids of each species was collected in close proximity to the pen. During the same week, 20 E. complanata and 20 L. radiata were collected from the Lamoille River delta, approximately 30 miles (48 km) north of Lewis Creek. Zebra mussels were not present at the Lamoille River delta, so this sample represented unionids living in a delta environment that had never been fouled by zebra mussels.},

	abstract = {Larvae of the invading mussels travelled from their native European waters to the Great Lakes in the bilge holds of cargo ships in the 1980s. Since then, like many other types of exotic or imported plants and animals, the mussel has taken to its new surroundings with a reproductive vengeance. Colonies with as many as 700,000 of the tiny fan-shaped creatures per square metre have been reported in the western basin of Lake Erie. The long-term cost of keeping the mussel away from beaches, boats, and water pipes has been estimated at billions of dollars.                 Today, Prof. [Richard Knapton] believes the ducks have some effect on controlling zebra mussel populations at Long Point, a critical stopover point for migrating birds. A more important factor in controlling mussel numbers, he believes, is a shortage of the micro- organisms the mussels eat. The mussels' food supply is diminished, especially in the summer, he says, when the currents that bring the micro-organisms to the mussels are not as strong.                 Researchers are still evaluating the impact all these birds might have on long-term zebra mussel populations in the Great Lakes, says David Ankney, a professor of zoology at the University of Western Ontario. A study of zebra mussel beds at Point Pelee by one of Prof. Ankney's graduate students, Diana Hamilton, found that waterfowl could eat as much as 40\%-50\% of the mussels in a given area.},

	abstract = {It's helped repel an expected invasion of zebra mussels, the dime- sized pests that encrust boat hulls, clog water intake pipes and interfere with fish feeding and spawning, says Ontario's Environment Ministry.                 The mussels haven't been spotted in any new locations this year and seem to be missing from most of the lakes in Muskoka and neighboring Haliburton area, where their discovery last year had cottagers and boaters fearing the worst.                 Researchers suspect the cool summer has slowed the spread of zebra mussels in the Great Lakes, which means it takes the creatures longer to find their way into inland waterways, where temperatures in shallow lakes are generally above the 12C (54F) the mussels need to reproduce.},

	abstract = {While the mute swan, the swan species most likely to be encountered along Toronto's waterfront, appears to be here to stay, if a co-ordinated effort were made in the relatively small number of provinces and states where the species has become established, it could be slowly and humanely eliminated, without a single bird being killed, by sterilizing the eggs.                 The other species I see as a potential threat to the environment is the red deer. Like the mute swan (plus the starling, pigeon, house sparrow, house mouse, purple loosestrife and zebra mussel) the red deer is native to Europe. It's kept on game farms in the province to provide venison to restaurants. It's a species with a track record of being able to establish itself in other regions, where its abundance has caused it to become a hated nuisance.                 We didn't know any better 101 years ago, but we should know better now, and yet we constantly run risks. I don't want to see our native wildlife replaced by non-native species. I don't want to see people hating red deer and mute swans. I don't want to see animal protectionists and conservationists fighting each other over relatively small differences in value systems, as has happened over the issue of culling deer threatening rare vegetation in isolated refugia in southwestern Ontario.},
