T1  - Managing biological invasions: the cost of inaction
AN  - 2706275679
AB  - Ecological and socio-economic impacts from biological invasions are rapidly escalating worldwide. While effective management underpins impact mitigation, such actions are often delayed, insufficient or entirely absent. Presently, management delays emanate from a lack of monetary rationale to invest at early invasion stages, which precludes effective prevention and eradication. Here, we provide such rationale by developing a conceptual model to quantify the cost of inaction, i.e., the additional expenditure due to delayed management, under varying time delays and management efficiencies. Further, we apply the model to management and damage cost data from a relatively data-rich genus ( Aedes mosquitoes). Our model demonstrates that rapid management interventions following invasion drastically minimise costs. We also identify key points in time that differentiate among scenarios of timely, delayed and severely delayed management intervention. Any management action during the severely delayed phase results in substantial losses of the potential maximum loss). For Aedes spp., we estimate that the existing management delay of 55 years led to an additional total cost of approximately $ 4.57 billion, compared to a scenario with management action only 7 years prior. Moreover, we estimate that in the absence of management action, long-term losses would have accumulated to US$ 32.31 billion. These results highlight the need for more timely management of invasive alien species — either pre-invasion, or as soon as possible after detection — by demonstrating how early investments rapidly reduce long-term economic impacts.

T1  - Development of a Binary Digestion System for Extraction Microplastics in Fish and Detection Method by Optical Photothermal Infrared
AN  - 2627870584
AB  - Accumulating evidence indicates that aquatic organisms ingest microplastics (MPs), which may be a threat to essentially the entire global ecosystem. In current detection methods, even in cutting-edge nanoplastic technology, a major challenge for detecting microplastics (MPs) in aquatic organisms is removing complex biological matrices, such as fat. Herein we report combining HNO3 and H2O2 to form a binary digestive reagent system to determine MPs in biological tissue. With insights obtained from a Gaussian model, the adding manners of two reagents were discussed. Thus, in the final protocol, we mixed MPs and tissue with 20 mL of 30% (v/v) aqueous H2O2, 10 mL 0.5 M NaOH,1 mL 5 mM Fe2+, and 40 mL 11.5% (v/v) aqueous HNO3, in sequence at different time intervals. What’s more, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and ultrasound—alone or together—were explored to solve the problem of removing fat residues and thus membrane blockage during filtration. In this paper, we used the O-PTIR microscope to verify the feasibility of the protocol. Compared with traditional detection methods, the O-PTIR spectroscopy can significantly improve the lateral resolution, down to sub and super-micrometer, and the ability to quickly obtain high spatial resolution far-field non-contact infrared spectra, which provide a novel method for qualitative analysis of MPs. In field applications, in our attempt, the fixed wavenumber image by O-PTIR can realize sub and super-micrometer MPs in-situ, far-field measurements. The present method is highly efficient, and facilitates the identification of plastic particles.

T1  - Cargoes in Motion:&nbsp;Materiality and Connectivity Across the Indian Ocean
AN  - 2617850056
AB  - An innovative collection of essays that foregrounds specific cargoes as a means to understand connectivity and mobility across the Indian Ocean world. 
Scholars have long appreciated the centrality of trade and commerce in understanding the connectivity and mobility that underpin human experience in the Indian Ocean region. But studies of merchant and commercial activities have paid little attention to the role that cargoes have played in connecting the disparate parts of this vast oceanic world. Drawing from the work of anthropologists, geographers, and historians, Cargoes in Motion tells the story of how material objects have informed and continue to shape processes of exchange across the Indian Ocean. 
By following selected cargoes through both space and time, this book makes an important and innovative contribution to Indian Ocean studies. The multidisciplinary approach deepens our understanding of the nature and dynamics of the Indian Ocean world by showing how transoceanic connectivity has been driven not only by economic, social, cultural, and political factors but also by the materiality of the objects themselves.

T1  - Tailings Management Handbook:&nbsp;A LifeCycle Approach
AN  - 2611289311
AB  - As long as we have mining and mineral processing, tailings and the responsible management thereof will remain at the forefront, with a company's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance in part a reflection of how well tailings risks are being managed. The Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) was published in August 2020, aiming to prevent catastrophic failure of tailings facilities by providing operators with specified measures and approaches throughout the mine life cycle, taking into account multiple stakeholder perspectives. In 2021, the International Council on Mining & Metals (ICMM) published the Tailings Management: Good Practice Guide intended to support safe, responsible management of tailings across the global mining industry, providing guidance on good governance and engineering practices to support continual improvement in tailings storage facility (TSF) management and help foster and strengthen the safety culture of mining companies. The Tailings Management Handbook is important and timely because there is no other comprehensive resource rooted in these new fundamentals and global principles for tailings management. Tailings management requires interdisciplinary and cross-functional understanding and support, which is apparent throughout this handbook. Dive into the wealth of information contributed by more than 100 world-renowned experts, beautifully crafted into a full-color handbook that focuses on the basics, life-cycle planning, site and tailings characterization, TSF design and construction, as well as systems and operations of TSFs. The inclusion of 42 case studies is an added plus with real-world successes and lessons learned.

T1  - Streptomyces-Derived Bioactive Pigments: Ecofriendly Source of Bioactive Compounds
AN  - 2756681827
AB  - Pigments have been used since historical times and are currently used in food, cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and other industries. One of the main sources of natural pigments are plants and insects; however, microorganisms are of great interest due to their bioactivities and advantages in their production. Actinobacteria, especially the genus Streptomyces, are biotechnologically valuable, producing specialized metabolites with a broad spectrum of bioactivities, such as antioxidant, anticancer, antibiofilm, antifouling, and antibiotic activities, as well as pigments, among others. In this review, we identify, summarize, and evaluate the evidence regarding the potential of Streptomyces strains to be biological sources of bioactive pigments. To conclude, future research will include purifying pigmented extracts that have already been reported, studying the purified compounds in a specific application, isolating new microorganisms from new isolation sources, improving the production of pigments already identified, modifying culture media or using new technologies, and developing new extraction techniques and a wide range of solvents that are ecofriendly and efficient.

T1  - Comparison of Membrane-Based Treatment Methods for the Removal of Micro-Pollutants from Reclaimed Water
AN  - 2739469854
AB  - Dual membrane hybrid systems generally produce reclaimed water for non-potable uses by blending microfiltered biologically treated sewage effluent (BTSE) and reverse osmosis (RO) permeate. This reclaimed water is found to contain a significant amount of micro-pollutants, which possibly cause toxicity effects to aquatic organisms and plants when exposed to it. Therefore, removing such pollutants from the reclaimed water before reaching the community is highly emphasized nowadays. The currently used treatment of the RO treatment of microfiltered BTSE is energy intensive and not cost effective. This paper focuses on less costly and efficient membrane-based hybrid treatment systems such as the microfiltration-adsorption (MF-GAC) hybrid system, Nano filter (NF) and RO in the removal of micro-pollutants from the microfiltered BTSE. Both the MF-GAC hybrid system and NF (with NTR 729HF membrane) removed 70 to 95% of micropollutants from microfiltered BTSE. The removal depends on the hydrophobicity, charge, and size of the micropollutants. RO was excellent in removing more than 90% of pollutants, while MF was inefficient, as the latter primarily depends on the size exclusion mechanism. Based on the finding, it is suggested to treat only a portion of microfiltered BTSE through the MF-GAC or NF membrane before blending with RO permeate to enhance the removal of micro-pollutants from reclaimed water. The development of sustainable hybrid systems for the removal of all micropollutants of different chemical and physical properties is the key for the water reclamation.

T1  - Taxonomic and Biochemical Characterization of Microalga Graesiella emersonii GEGS21 for Its Potential to Become Feedstock for Biofuels and Bioproducts
AN  - 2739435986
AB  - Graesiella emersonii is a commercially exploitable source of bioactive compounds and biofuels with potential applications in microalgae-based industries. Despite this, little taxonomical information is available. Therefore, proper identification and characterization are needed for the sustainable utilization of isolated microalgae. In this study, an axenically isolated unicellular green alga from the Geumgang Estuary, Korea was investigated for its morphological, molecular, and biochemical characteristics. The morphological characteristics were typical of G. emersonii. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of the 18S rDNA sequence verified that the isolate belonged to G. emersonii and was subsequently named G. emersonii GEGS21. It was isolated from brackish water, and its optimal growth temperature, salinity, and light intensity were at 28–32 °C, 0 M NaCl, and 130–160 µmol m−2 s−1, respectively. The strain thrived over a range of temperatures (5–40 °C) and withstood up to 0.5 M NaCl. The isolate was rich in omega-6 linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6, 26.3%) and palmitic acid (C16:0, 27.5%). The fuel quality properties were determined, and biodiesel from GEGS21 could be used as a biodiesel blend. Value-added carotenoids lutein (1.5 mg g−1 dry cell weight, DCW) and neoxanthin (1.2 mg g−1 DCW) were biosynthesized as accessory pigments by this microalga. The biomass of this microalga may serve as feedstock for biodiesel production as well as producing valuable ω-6 and carotenoids.

T1  - An Overview of Analytical Methods to Determine Pharmaceutical Active Compounds in Aquatic Organisms
AN  - 2734704245
AB  - There is increasing scientific evidence that some pharmaceuticals are present in the marine ecosystems at concentrations that may cause adverse effects on the organisms that inhabit them. At present, there is still very little scientific literature on the (bio)accumulation of these compounds in different species, let alone on the relationship between the presence of these compounds and the adverse effects they produce. However, attempts have been made to optimize and validate analytical methods for the determination of residues of pharmaceuticals in marine biota by studying the stages of sample treatment, sample clean-up and subsequent analysis. The proposed bibliographic review includes a summary of the most commonly techniques, and its analytical features, proposed to determine pharmaceutical compounds in aquatic organisms at different levels of the trophic chain in the last 10 years.

Current chemical identification strategies in NTS experiments typically depend on spectral libraries, chemical databases, and in silico fragmentation tools. However, small molecule identification remains challenging due to the lack of orthogonal sources of information (e.g., unique fragments). Collision cross section (CCS) values measured by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) offer an additional identification dimension to increase the confidence level. Thanks to the advances in analytical instrumentation, an increasing application of IMS hybrid with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) in NTS has been reported in the recent decades. Several CCS prediction tools have been developed. However, limited CCS prediction methods were based on a large scale of chemical classes and cross-platform CCS measurements. We successfully developed two prediction models using a random forest machine learning algorithm. One of the approaches was based on chemicals’ super classes; the other model was direct CCS prediction using molecular fingerprint. Over 13,324 CCS values from six different laboratories and PubChem using a variety of ion-mobility separation techniques were used for training and testing the models. The test accuracy for all the prediction models was over 0.85, and the median of relative residual was around 2.2%. The models can be applied to different IMS platforms to eliminate false positives in small molecule identification.

T1  - Derivatives of Plastics as Potential Carcinogenic Factors: The Current State of Knowledge
AN  - 2724229872
AB  - Simple SummaryNowadays, micro- and nanoplastic particles can be found almost everywhere, being especially harmful for humans. Their absorption, primarily via inhalation and digestive routes, might lead to a particularly dangerous accumulation of those substances within the human body. Due to the alarming increase in contamination worldwide and excessive production of plastics and synthetic materials, there is an urgent need to investigate the effects of those substances on human health. So far, it has been observed that nano- and microplastics might be extremely harmful, leading to serious health conditions, such as cancers of various human body systems.AbstractMicro- and nanoplatics have been already reported to be potential carcinogenic/mutagenic substances that might cause DNA damage, leading to carcinogenesis. Thus, the effects of micro- and nanoplastics exposure on human health are currently being investigated extensively to establish clear relationships between those substances and health consequences. So far, it has been observed that there exists a definite correlation between exposure to micro- and nanoplastic particles and the onset of several cancers. Therefore, we have conducted research using PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, searching for all the research papers devoted to cancers that could be potentially related to the subject of exposure to nano- and microplastics. Ultimately, in this paper, we have discussed several cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, biliary tract cancer, and some endocrine-related cancers.

T1  - Magnetic Resonance Neuroimaging Contrast Agents of Nanomaterials
AN  - 2712664502
AB  - Since the early 1980s when MRI imaging technology was put into clinical use, the number of MRI clinical tests has steadily increased by more than 10% every year. At the same time, exogenous MRI contrast agents have also been developed with the development of MRI technology. However, there are still challenges in the preparation of contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging, such as how to prepare high-efficiency contrast agents with high stability and low biological toxicity. In order to study the contrast agent with simple preparation method, low cost, and good imaging effect, a magnetic resonance contrast agent was prepared by magnetic nanoparticles. By acting on magnetic resonance imaging detection method, and using polymer ligands to synthesize magnetic nanoparticles, experiments and tests of P(MA-alt-VAc) polymer ligand-modified magnetic nanoparticles were carried out. The experimental results showed that when nanoparticles containing different iron ion concentrations were incubated with DC 2.4 normal cells for 48 hours, the cell viability was still higher than 80% at concentrations up to 200 μm. It shows that the nanoparticle has high cell activity and good biological adaptability. The transverse relaxation (r2) value of the nanoparticles in aqueous solution at 37°C and 1.5 T magnetic field is 231.1 m-1 s-1, which is much higher than that of PTMP-PMAA (r2=35.1 mM-1 s-1), which is also more than five times the relaxation of SHU-555C (r2=44 mM-1 s-1). It shows that the nanoparticles prepared in this paper have good effect and can be used as a contrast agent in human brain for magnetic resonance imaging.

T1  - Analysis of Total-Forms of Cyanotoxins Microcystins in Biological Matrices: A Methodological Review
AN  - 2706462062
AB  - Microcystins (MCs) are cyclic heptapeptidic toxins produced by many cyanobacteria. Microcystins can be accumulated in various matrices in two forms: a free cellular fraction and a covalently protein-bound form. To detect and quantify the concentration of microcystins, a panel of techniques on various matrices (water, sediments, and animal tissues) is available. The analysis of MCs can concern the free or the total (free plus covalently bound) fractions. Free-form analyses of MCs are the most common and easiest to detect, whereas total-form analyses are much less frequent and more complex to achieve. The objective of this review is to summarize the different methods of extraction and analysis that have been developed for total forms. Four extraction methods were identified: MMPB (2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutyric acid) method, deconjugation at basic pH, ozonolysis, and laser irradiation desorption. The study of the bibliography on the methods of extraction and analysis of the total forms of MCs showed that the reference method for the subject remains the MMPB method even if alternative methods and, in particular, deconjugation at basic pH, showed results encouraging the continuation of the methodological development on different matrices and on naturally-contaminated samples.

T1  - Tissue-Specific and Time-Dependent Expressions of PC4s in Bay Scallop (Argopecten irradians irradians) Reveal Function Allocation in Thermal Response
AN  - 2679735387
AB  - Transcriptional coactivator p15 (PC4) encodes a structurally conserved but functionally diverse protein that plays crucial roles in RNAP-II-mediated transcription, DNA replication and damage repair. Although structures and functions of PC4 have been reported in most vertebrates and some invertebrates, the PC4 genes were less systematically identified and characterized in the bay scallop Argopecten irradians irradians. In this study, five PC4 genes (AiPC4s) were successfully identified in bay scallops via whole-genome scanning through in silico analysis. Protein structure and phylogenetic analyses of AiPC4s were conducted to determine the identities and evolutionary relationships of these genes. Expression levels of AiPC4s were assessed in embryos/larvae at all developmental stages, in healthy adult tissues and in different tissues (mantles, gills, hemocytes and hearts) being processed under 32 °C stress with different time durations (0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 3 d, 6 d and 10 d). Spatiotemporal expression profiles of AiPC4s suggested the functional roles of the genes in embryos/larvae at all developmental stages and in healthy adult tissues in bay scallop. Expression regulations (up- and down-) of AiPC4s under high-temperature stress displayed both tissue-specific and time-dependent patterns with function allocations, revealing that AiPC4s performed differentiated functions in response to thermal stress. This work provides clues of molecular function allocation of PC4 in scallops in response to thermal stress and helps in illustrating how marine bivalves resist elevated seawater temperature.

T1  - Ecological Impact of End-of-Life-Tire (ELT)-Derived Rubbers: Acute and Chronic Effects at Organism and Population Levels
AN  - 2670423077
AB  - Considering the large amount of tires that reach the end of life every year, the aim of this study was the evaluation of both acute and chronic effects of end-of-life-tire (ELT)-derived rubber granules (ELT-dg) and powder (ELT-dp) on a freshwater trophic chain represented by the green alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata, the crustacean Daphnia magna and the teleost Danio rerio (zebrafish). Adverse effects were evaluated at the organism and population levels through the classical ecotoxicological tests. Acute tests on D. magna and D. rerio revealed a 50% effect concentration (EC50) > 100.0 mg/L for both ELT-dg and ELT-dp. Chronic exposures had a lowest observed effect concentration (LOEC) of 100.0 mg/L for both ELT-dg and ELT-dp on P. subcapitata grow rate and yield. LOEC decreased in the other model organisms, with a value of 9.8 mg/L for D. magna, referring to the number of living offspring, exposed to ELT-dg suspension. Similarly, in D. rerio, the main results highlighted a LOEC of 10.0 mg/L regarding the survival and juvenile weight parameters for ELT-dg and a LOEC of 10.0 mg/L concerning the survival and abnormal behavior in specimens exposed to ELT-dp. Tested materials exhibited a threshold of toxicity of 9.8 mg/L, probably a non-environmental concentration, although further investigations are needed to clarify the potential ecological impact of these emerging contaminants.

T1  - Rhodnius prolixus Hemolymph Immuno-Physiology: Deciphering the Systemic Immune Response Triggered by Trypanosoma cruzi Establishment in the Vector Using Quantitative Proteomics
AN  - 2662877033
AB  - Understanding the development of Trypanosoma cruzi within the triatomine vector at the molecular level should provide novel targets for interrupting parasitic life cycle and affect vectorial competence. The aim of the current study is to provide new insights into triatomines immunology through the characterization of the hemolymph proteome of Rhodnius prolixus, a major Chagas disease vector, in order to gain an overview of its immune physiology. Surprisingly, proteomics investigation of the immunomodulation of T. cruzi-infected blood reveals that the parasite triggers an early systemic response in the hemolymph. The analysis of the expression profiles of hemolymph proteins from 6 h to 24 h allowed the identification of a broad range of immune proteins expressed already in the early hours post-blood-feeding regardless of the presence of the parasite, ready to mount a rapid response exemplified by the significant phenol oxidase activation. Nevertheless, we have also observed a remarkable induction of the immune response triggered by an rpPGRP-LC and the overexpression of defensins 6 h post-T. cruzi infection. Moreover, we have identified novel proteins with immune properties such as the putative c1q-like protein and the immunoglobulin I-set domain-containing protein, which have never been described in triatomines and could play a role in T. cruzi recognition. Twelve proteins with unknown function are modulated by the presence of T. cruzi in the hemolymph. Determining the function of these parasite-induced proteins represents an exciting challenge for increasing our knowledge about the diversity of the immune response from the universal one studied in holometabolous insects. This will provide us with clear answers for misunderstood mechanisms in host–parasite interaction, leading to the development of new generation strategies to control vector populations and pathogen transmission.

T1  - Oscillation Flow Dam Operation Method for Algal Bloom Mitigation
AN  - 2653040959
AB  - Green algae play an important role in ecosystems as primary producers, but they can cause algal blooms, which are socio-environmental burdens as responding to them requires water resources from dam reservoirs. This study proposes an alternative for reducing algal blooms through dam operation without using additional water resources. A novel oscillation flow concept was suggested: oscillating discharge of dam for irregular flow. To examine its effect, the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code—National Institute of Environment Research (EFDC-NIER) model was constructed and calibrated for the Namhan River, South Korea, from downstream of the Chungju Dam to downstream of Gangcheon Weir. The water quality in the study area were simulated and analyzed for August 2019, which is when the largest number of harmful cyanobacteria had been reported in recent years. Our results showed that the oscillation flow produced significant variance of flow velocity, and algal bloom density in the Namhan River was reduced by 20–30% through the operation of the Chungju Dam. However, further study and investigation are required before practical application.

T1  - In-Site Phenotype of the Settlement Space along China’s Grand Canal Tianjin Section: GIS-sDNA-Based Model Analysis
AN  - 2652964991
AB  - The settlement space along China’s Grand Canal composes an important part of the Canal heritage, has a close bearing on the production and life of the residents there, nourishes rich culture and wisdom and boasts vital value of conservation and inheritance. Due to China’s rapid urbanization and industrialization, the settlements along the canal have been destroyed to some extent and their in-site characteristics urgently need excavation and conservation. Through field investigation, space syntax and GIS analysis, this paper performs quantitative analysis of the in-site characteristics of 18 typical rural settlements there. The findings show that: (1) The settlement space of industry dominant type for commerce and trade is comparatively dynamic and the capacity of topology and integration and the attractive force of the settlement center are stronger. (2) The dynamic scope of the citizens’ everyday traveling in the settlements has the closest correlation with the data of public-service facilities. (3) The settlements along the canal boast multiple, causal and blended in-site phenotype. The research findings provide new standards to categorize the settlements along China’s Grand Canal, paths and methods to explore the characteristics of the settlements and new cognitive perspectives to conserve and renew the settlements along China’s Grand Canal Tianjin Section.

T1  - A Semianalytical Algorithm for Estimating Water Transparency in Different Optical Water Types from MERIS Data
AN  - 2633154308
AB  - Water transparency (or Secchi disk depth: ZSD) is a key parameter of water quality; thus, it is very important to routinely monitor. In this study, we made four efforts to improve a state-of-the-art ZSD estimation algorithm that was developed in 2019 on the basis of a new underwater visibility theory proposed in 2015. The four efforts were: (1) classifying all water into clear (Type I), moderately turbid (Type II), highly turbid (Type III), or extremely turbid (Type IV) water types; (2) selecting different reference wavelengths and corresponding semianalytical models for each water type; (3) employing an estimation model to represent reasonable shapes for particulate backscattering coefficients based on the water type classification; and (4) constraining likely wavelength range at which the minimum diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd(λ)) will occur for each water type. The performance of the proposed ZSD estimation algorithm was compared to that of the original state-of-the-art algorithm using a simulated dataset (N = 91,287, ZSD values 0.01 to 44.68 m) and an in situ measured dataset (N = 305,  ZSD values 0.3 to 16.4 m). The results showed a significant improvement with a reduced mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) from 116% to 65% for simulated data and from 32% to 27% for in situ data. Outliers in the previous algorithm were well addressed in the new algorithm. We further evaluated the developed  ZSD estimation algorithm using medium resolution imaging spectrometer (MERIS) images acquired from Lake Kasumigaura, Japan. The results obtained from 19 matchups revealed that the estimated  ZSD matched well with the in situ measured  ZSD, with a MAPE of 15%. The developed ZSD estimation algorithm can probably be applied to different optical water types due to its semianalytical features.

T1  - Citric Acid-Mediated Microwave-Hydrothermal Synthesis of Mesoporous F-Doped HAp Nanorods from Bio-Waste for Biocidal Implant Applications
AN  - 2627808415
AB  - In this current research, mesoporous nano-hydroxyapatite (HAp) and F-doped hydroxyapatite (FHAp) were effectively obtained through a citric acid-enabled microwave hydrothermal approach. Citric acid was used as a chelating and modifying agent for tuning the structure and porosity of the HAp structure. This is the first report to use citric acid as a modifier for producing mesoporous nano HAp and F-doped FHAp. The obtained samples were characterized by different analyses. The XRD data revealed that F is incorporated well into the HAp crystal structure. The crystallinity of HAp samples was improved and the unit cell volume was lowered with fluorine incorporation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the obtained samples revealed that a nano rod-like shape was obtained. The mesoporous structures of the produced HAp samples were confirmed by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. In vivo studies performed using zebrafish and C. elegans prove the non-toxic behavior of the synthesized F doped HAp samples. The obtained samples are also analyzed for antimicrobial activity using Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which are majorly involved in implant failure. The F doped samples revealed excellent bactericidal activity. Hence, this study confirms that the non-toxic and excellent antibacterial mesoporous F doped HAp can be a useful candidate for biocidal implant application.

T1  - Dinophiliformia early neurogenesis suggests the evolution of conservative neural structures across the Annelida phylogenetic tree
AN  - 2607916444
AB  - Despite the increasing data concerning the structure of the adult nervous system in various Lophotrochozoa groups, the early events during the neurogenesis of rare and unique groups need clarification. Annelida are a diverse clade of Lophotrochozoa, and their representatives demonstrate a variety of body plans, lifestyles, and life cycles. Comparative data about the early development are available for Errantia, Sedentaria, Sipuncula, and Palaeoannelida; however, our knowledge of Dinophiliformia is currently scarce. Representatives of Dinophiliformia are small interstitial worms combining unique morphological features of different Lophotrochozoan taxa and expressing paedomorphic traits. We describe in detail the early neurogenesis of two related species: Dimorphilus gyrociliatus and Dinophilus vorticoides, from the appearance of first nerve cells until the formation of an adult body plan. In both species, the first cells were detected at the anterior and posterior regions at the early trochophore stage and demonstrated positive reactions with pan-neuronal marker anti-acetylated tubulin only. Long fibers of early cells grow towards each other and form longitudinal bundles along which differentiating neurons later appear and send their processes. We propose that these early cells serve as pioneer neurons, forming a layout of the adult nervous system. The early anterior cell of D. vorticoides is transient and present during the short embryonic period, while early anterior and posterior cells in D. gyrociliatus are maintained throughout the whole lifespan of the species. During development, the growing processes of early cells form compact brain neuropile, paired ventral and lateral longitudinal bundles; unpaired medial longitudinal bundle; and commissures in the ventral hyposphere. Specific 5-HT- and FMRFa-immunopositive neurons differentiate adjacent to the ventral bundles and brain neuropile in the middle trochophore and late trochophore stages, i.e. after the main structures of the nervous system have already been established. Processes of 5-HT- and FMRFa-positive cells constitute a small proportion of the tubulin-immunopositive brain neuropile, ventral cords, and commissures in all developmental stages. No 5-HT- and FMRFa-positive cells similar to apical sensory cells of other Lophotrochozoa were detected. We conclude that: (i) like in Errantia and Sedentaria, Dinophiliformia neurogenesis starts from the peripheral cells, whose processes prefigure the forming adult nervous system, (ii) Dinophiliformia early cells are negative to 5-HT and FMRFa antibodies like Sedentaria pioneer cells.

T1  - An annotated checklist of the eukaryotic parasites of humans, exclusive of fungi and algae
AN  - 2595167138
AB  - The classification of “parasites” in the medical field is a challenging notion, a group which historically has included all eukaryotes exclusive of fungi that invade and derive resources from the human host. Since antiquity, humans have been identifying and documenting parasitic infections, and this collective catalog of parasitic agents has expanded considerably with technology. As our understanding of species boundaries and the use of molecular tools has evolved, so has our concept of the taxonomy of human parasites. Consequently, new species have been recognized while others have been relegated to synonyms. On the other hand, the decline of expertise in classical parasitology and limited curricula have led to a loss of awareness of many rarely encountered species. Here, we provide a comprehensive checklist of all reported eukaryotic organisms (excluding fungi and allied taxa) parasitizing humans resulting in 274 genus-group taxa and 848 species-group taxa. For each species, or genus where indicated, a concise summary of geographic distribution, natural hosts, route of transmission and site within human host, and vectored pathogens are presented. Ubiquitous, human-adapted species as well as very rare, incidental zoonotic organisms are discussed in this annotated checklist. We also provide a list of 79 excluded genera and species that have been previously reported as human parasites but are not believed to be true human parasites or represent misidentifications or taxonomic changes.

T1  - Role of nearshore benthic algae in the Lake Michigan silica cycle
AN  - 2564928394
AB  - Si cycling is linked with processes from global carbon sequestration to community composition and is especially important in aquatic ecosystems. Lake Michigan has seen dramatic fluctuations in dissolved silica (dSi) over several decades, which have been examined in the context of planktonic processes (diatom blooms), but the role of benthic organisms (macroalgae and their epiphytes) in Si cycling have not been explored. To assess significance of nearshore benthic algae in Si dynamics, we assembled dSi data from an offshore site sampled since the late 1980’s, and sampled off three Milwaukee beaches during 2005–19. Using colorimetric assays and alkaline digestion, we measured dSi, biogenic silica in particulate suspended material (pSi) and biogenic silica in benthic macroalgae (Cladophora) and epiphytic diatoms (bSi). Offshore, dSi increased about 1 μM per year from 25 μM in the late 1980’s to nearly 40 μM in 2019. Nearshore dSi fluctuated dramatically annually, from near zero to concentrations similar to offshore. Both Cladophora and its epiphytes contained significant bSi, reaching up to 30% of dry mass (300 mg Si g dry mass-1) of the assemblage in summer. Microscopic analyses including localization with a Si-specific-stain and X-ray microanalysis showed bSi in epiphytic diatom cells walls, but the nature and localization of Si in macroalgae remained unclear. A simple model was developed estimating Si demand of algae using the areal macroalgal biomass, growth rates inferred from P-content, and bSi content, and comparing Si demand with dSi available in the water column. This indicated that 7–70% of the dSi in water overlying nearshore benthic algal beds could be removed per day. Key elements of the Si cycle, including which organisms sequester bSi and how rapidly Si is recycled, remain unclear. This work has implications for coastal marine waters where large macroalgal biomass accumulates but bSi content is virtually unknown.

T1  - Evaluating the performance of DNA metabarcoding for assessment of zooplankton communities in Western Lake Superior using multiple markers
AN  - 2554793376
AB  - For DNA metabarcoding to attain its potential as a community assessment tool, we need to better understand its performance versus traditional morphological identification and work to address any remaining performance gaps in incorporating DNA metabarcoding into community assessments. Using fragments of the18Snuclear and16Smitochondrial rRNA genes and two fragments of the mitochondrial COI marker, we examined the use of DNA metabarcoding and traditional morphological identification for understanding the diversity and composition of crustacean zooplankton at 42 sites across western Lake Superior. We identified 51 zooplankton taxa (genus or species, depending on the finest resolution of the taxon across all identification methods), of which 17 were identified using only morphological traits, 13 using only DNA and 21 using both methods. The taxa found using only DNA metabarcoding included four species and one genus-level identification not previously known to occur in Lake Superior, the presence of which still needs to be confirmed. A substantial portion of taxa that were identified to genus or species by morphological identification, but not identified using DNA metabarcoding, had zero (“no record”) or < 2 (“underrepresented records”) reference barcodes in the BOLD or NCBI databases (63% for COI, 80% for16S, 74% for18S). The two COI marker fragments identified the most genus- and species-level taxa, whereas18Swas the only marker whose family-level percent sequence abundance patterns showed high correlation to composition patterns from morphological identification, based on aNMDSanalysis of Bray-Curtis similarities. Multiple replicates were collected at a subset of sites and an occupancy analysis was performed, which indicated that rare taxa were more likely to be detected using DNA metabarcoding than traditional morphology. Our results support that DNA metabarcoding can augment morphological identification for estimating zooplankton diversity and composition of zooplankton over space and time, but may require use of multiple markers. Further addition of taxa to reference DNA databases will improve our ability to use DNA metabarcoding to identify zooplankton and other invertebrates in aquatic surveys.

Water is one of the most precious and basic needs of life for all living beings, and a precious national asset. Without it, the existence of life cannot be imagined. Availability of pure water is decreasing day by day, and water scarcity has become a major problem that our society has faced for the past few years. Hence, it is essential to find and disseminate the key solutions for water quality and scarcity issues. Inaccessibility and poor water quality continue to pose a major threat to human health worldwide. Around billions of people lack to access drinkable water, and, often, water contains pathogenic impurities which are responsible for water-borne diseases. The concept of water quality mainly depends on the chemical, physical, biological, and radiological measurement standards to evaluate the water quality and determine the concentration of all components, then compare the results of this concentration with the purpose for which this water is used. Therefore, awareness and a firm grounding in water science are the primary needs of readers, professionals, and researchers working in this research area. 
This book explores the basic concepts and applications of water science. It provides an in-depth look at water pollutants' classification, water recycling, qualitative and quantitative analysis, and efficient wastewater treatment methodologies. It also provides occurrence, human health risk assessment, strategies for removal of radionuclides and pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems. The book chapters are written by leading researchers throughout the world. This book is an invaluable guide to students, professors, scientists and R&D industrial specialists working in the field of environmental science, geoscience, water science, physics and chemistry.

T1  - Explore the Eelgrass Meadow with Sam and Crystal
AN  - 2528903944
AB  - With beautiful, scientifically accurate illustrations, this fascinating story teaches children about the many fish, crustaceans, marine mammals, and micro-organisms that live in and feed off the eelgrass meadows of the north Pacific coastal region. "Recommended for school and public libraries regardless of their proximity to the west coast. Although works of fiction, the books contain a wealth of accessible facts."--Resource Links "A major theme that emerges is the need to respect and care for the ocean environment and to understand the harmony among its inhabitants. These appealing, fact-rich books go a long way to enhancing that understanding for young readers. Highly recommended."--CM: Canadian Review of Materials Sam and Crystal's coastal adventure continues as brother and sister dive deeper--literally--into the marine habitats of Eagle Cove, home of Aunt Kate and Uncle Charlie. In their third adventure, the kids learn about one of the most ecologically important ecosystems on the west coast: the eelgrass meadow. This rich habitat provides food and shelter to countless marine critters--from tiny micro-organisms to hundreds of fish species to giant marine mammals, such as humpback whales. Ada, an Indigenous woman from nearby Salmon Bay Village, tells the children about her people's knowledge of land and sea, complementing Aunt Kate's Western scientific teachings and reinforcing the importance of respecting nature. Combining an entertaining story with gorgeous imagery and the author's scientific background and extensive work with Indigenous Elders and educators, Explore the Emerald Eelgrass Meadow with Sam and Crystal brings the coastline to life for children ages eight and up.

T1  - American Covenant:&nbsp;National Parks, Their Promise, and Our Nation's Future
AN  - 2486879628
AB  - An intimate and candid account of our national parks and their strengths, vulnerabilities, and essential role in American life Part memoir, part critique, and paean to the value of national parks, American Covenant distills the experience and insights from two long careers in conservation. Michael A. Soukup and Gary E. Machlis show how the national parks are essential to maintaining the essence of our national heritage, and key to America's future in a changing climate and political landscape. Sharing real-world examples of both victories and defeats in protecting national parks, this candid, thoughtful book reminds us that the national parks are a promise--a covenant--within and between generations of Americans. The book is also a call to revitalize, reconstitute, reconfigure, and reform the National Park Service, which the authors believe is governed too much by outdated management practices and politics instead of a foundation of expertise and science.

T1  - Accumulation of heavy metals in tilapia fish species and related histopathological changes in muscles, gills and liver of Oreochromis niloticus occurring in the area of Qahr El-Bahr, Lake Al-Manzalah, Egypt
AN  - 2815286925
AB  - Accumulation of metals (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, Pb, Cd and Ni) in the muscles and gills of Oreochromis niloticus, Oreochromis aureus and Tilapia zillii was assessed based on seven locations in the Qahr El-Bahr area in Lake Al-Manzalah. The average accumulation of metals was in the following order: Tilapia zillii > Oreochromis aureus > Oreochromis niloticus. To determine the risk of fish consumption, the estimated daily intake, carcinogenic, non-carcinogenic and relative risk indices were calculated. The results indicate that the intake of individual metals through the consumption of fish is almost safe for human health, whereas the intake of combined metals poses a high potential health risk to consumers. Assessment of carcinogenic risk of Cd and Ni from the consumption of tilapia species indicates that consumers are at risk of cancer. The contribution of Pb and Cd to the overall relative risk index ranged from 34% to 41%. Of the three species studied, Oreochromis niloticus is relatively safe for consumption as it poses the least health hazard, while Tilapia zillii is more predisposed to accumulate metals in its tissues. Histopathological changes were observed in the muscles, gills and liver of Oreochromis niloticus as a result of heavy metal accumulation in these organs.

T1  - Boat to bowl: resilience through network rewiring of a community-supported fishery amid the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2512976441
AB  - Fisheries are coupled human–natural systems locally, regionally, and globally. However, human–nature interactions within and between adjacent and distant systems (metacouplings) are rarely studied in fisheries despite their prevalence and policy relevance. We filled this knowledge gap by using network models to identify how the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has rewired couplings and reshaped resilience of Fishadelphia, a community-supported fishery program (CSF) in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA. As abstractions illustrating interactions among supply-chain actors, networks are helpful for characterizing flows and assessing resilience to disturbances such as those induced by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Since Fall 2018, 18 seafood (finfish and shellfish) species totaling 6273 lbs have flowed from harvesters (n = 4), to processors (n = 2), to a distributor, to retailers (n = 2), and finally to customers (n = 183). The pandemic reduced the number of seafood harvesters and processors (−50%), seafood flow quantity (−25%), species diversity in the marketplace (−67%), and species per supplier (−50%) before stopping flows in mid-March 2020, when Fishadelphia closed for 3 months. Models of network optimality indicated that the pandemic fragmented metacouplings that previously allowed multiple seafood suppliers to provide diverse products to customers. However, demand-side resilience increased through dispersed, socially distanced, efficient seafood delivery that expanded the customer base and generally increased customer satisfaction. This resilience dichotomy—wherein the post-closure network was less resilient than the pre-closure network in supply-side species diversity, but more resilient in demand-side social distancing, delivery efficiency, and customer satisfaction—has implications for rewiring networks to sustain CSFs and other local food systems amid ecological and social disturbances.

T1  - Ecological Conditions of the Lower Dniester and Some Indicators for Assessment of the Hydropower Impact
AN  - 2624248847
AB  - The Dniester is one of the largest transboundary rivers of the Black Sea basin, and its lower reaches integrate the influence of climate change and hydropower plant (HPP) impact on the waterway. The decrease in precipitation and average annual air temperature increase and intensive hydroelectric construction have led to a decline in the total water content of the river, during the last 10 years, being below the long-term historical “norm”. The shifts in the river flow result in multidirectional seasonal dynamics of nutrient concentrations. During the modern period, a stabilization of nutrient concentrations takes place, being lower than at the peak of eutrophication in the 1970s–1980s, but higher than in the natural flow period. The construction of reservoirs leads to a long-term decline in silica concentrations, continuing in the modern period. The concentration of heavy metals and metalloids in water and bottom sediments of the river generally corresponds to the ecological status of “Moderate”. Biological communities show a high β-diversity of microalgae, but low diversity of plankton and benthic invertebrates. Biological communities respond to the impact of HPP in both the short- and long-term. Hydroelectric dams change the bioavailability of nutrients downstream which, in the long-term, causes shifts in phytoplankton composition, especially the reduction of Bacillariophyta due to the lack of silicates that are deposited in reservoirs. However, in the short-term, after the discharge from the HPP dam, the concentration of silicates and the proportion of diatoms increase. Long-term changes also include a decline in the proportion of Rotifera and an increase in Copepoda in the total abundance of zooplankton and the unification of the benthic community with an increase in the biomass of gastropods in the area, which can be considered as indicators of the impact of hydroelectric power plants. The saprobity index, calculated both for zooplankton and macrozoobenthos, characterised the water as moderately polluted; benthic biotic indexes (Biological monitoring working party (BMWP), Belgian Biotic Index (BBI), Danish Stream Fauna Index (DSFI)) calculated on macrozoobenthos described the condition as “low” quality.

T1  - Natural and Anthropogenic Factors Shaping the Shoreline of Klaipėda, Lithuania
AN  - 2612800164
AB  - Port of Klaipėda is situated in a complex hydrological system, between the Curonian Lagoon and the Baltic Sea, at the Klaipėda strait in the South-Eastern part of the Baltic Sea. It has almost 300 m of jetties separating the Curonian Spit and the mainland coast, interrupting the main path of sediment transport through the South-Eastern coast of the Baltic Sea. Due to the Port of Klaipėda reconstruction in 2002 and the beach nourishment project, which was started in 2014, the shoreline position change tendency was observed. Shoreline position measurements of various periods can be used to derive quantitative estimates of coastal process directions and intensities. These data can be used to further our understanding of the scale and timing of shoreline changes in a geological and socio-economic context. This study analyzes long- and short-term shoreline position changes before and after the Port of Klaipėda reconstruction in 2002. Positions of historical shorelines from various sources were used, and the rates (EPR, NSM, and SCE) of shoreline changes have been assessed using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). An extension of ArcGIS K-means clustering was applied for shoreline classification into different coastal dynamic stretches. Coastal development has changed in the long-term (1984–2019) perspective: the eroded coast length increased from 1.5 to 4.2 km in the last decades. Coastal accumulation processes have been restored by the Port of Klaipėda executing the coastal zone nourishment project in 2014.

T1  - Exposure to the Insecticide Sulfoxaflor Affects Behaviour and Biomarkers Responses of Carcinus maenas (Crustacea: Decapoda)
AN  - 2612738470
AB  - Simple SummarySulfoxaflor is an insecticide for which there are few studies regarding its toxicity to non-target organisms. The present study aimed to investigate the acute and sub-lethal effects of sulfoxaflor on Carcinus maenas by addressing survival, behaviour, and biomarkers. Sulfoxaflor affected feed intake and motricity of C. maenas. From the integrated analysis of endpoints, with the increase in concentrations of sulfoxaflor, after seven days, one can notice a lower detoxification capacity, higher lipid peroxidation, and higher motricity effects and lower feed intake. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of the negative impacts of sulfoxaflor on green crabs and increase knowledge of this pesticide toxicity to non-target coastal invertebrates.AbstractSulfoxaflor is an insecticide belonging to the recent sulfoximine class, acting as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChRs) agonist. There are few studies regarding sulfoxaflor’s toxicity to non-target organisms. The present study aimed to investigate the acute and sub-lethal effects of sulfoxaflor on Carcinus maenas by addressing survival, behaviour (feed intake and motricity), and neuromuscular, detoxification and oxidative stress, and energy metabolism biomarkers. Adult male green crabs were exposed to sulfoxaflor for 96 h and an LC50 of 2.88 mg L−1 was estimated. All biomarker endpoints were sampled after three (T3) and seven (T7) days of exposure and behavioural endpoints were addressed at T3 and day six (T6). Sulfoxaflor affected the feed intake and motricity of C. maenas at T6. From the integrated analysis of endpoints, with the increase in concentrations of sulfoxaflor, after seven days, one can notice a lower detoxification capacity (lower GST), higher LPO levels and effects on behaviour (higher motricity effects and lower feed intake). This integrated approach proved to be valuable in understanding the negative impacts of sulfoxaflor on green crabs, while contributing to the knowledge of this pesticide toxicity to non-target coastal invertebrates.

T1  - Multi-Year Simulation of Western Lake Erie Hydrodynamics and Biogeochemistry to Evaluate Nutrient Management Scenarios
AN  - 2554772627
AB  - During the 1970s, harmful cyanobacteria (HFCB) were common occurrences in western Lake Erie. Remediation strategies reduced total P loads and bloom frequency; however, HFCB have reoccurred since the mid-1990s under increased system stress from climate change. Given these concurrent changes in nutrient loading and climate forcing, there is a need to develop management tools to investigate historical changes in the lake and predict future water quality. Herein, we applied coupled one-dimensional hydrodynamic and biogeochemical models (GLM–AED) to reproduce water quality conditions of western Lake Erie from 1979 through 2015, thereby removing the obstacle of setting and scaling initial conditions in management scenarios. The physical forcing was derived from surface buoys, airports, and land-based stations. Nutrient loads were reconstructed from historical monitoring data. The root-mean-square errors between simulations and observations for water levels (0.36 m), surface water temperature (2.5 °C), and concentrations of total P (0.01 mg L−1), PO4 (0.01 mg L−1), NH4 (0.03 mg L−1), NO3 (0.68 mg L−1), total chlorophyll a (18.74 μg L−1), chlorophytes (3.94 μg L−1), cyanobacteria (12.44 μg L−1), diatoms (3.17 μg L−1), and cryptophytes (3.18 μg L−1) were minimized using model-independent parameter estimation, and were within literature ranges from single year three-dimensional simulations. A sensitivity analysis shows that 40% reductions of total P and dissolved reactive P loads would have been necessary to bring blooms under the mild threshold (9600 MTA cyanobacteria biomass) during recent years (2005–2015), consistent with the Annex 4 recommendation. However, these would not likely be achieved by applying best management practices in the Maumee River watershed.

T1  - Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms in Aquatic Ecosystems: A Comprehensive Outlook on Current and Emerging Mitigation and Control Approaches
AN  - 2554614160
AB  - An intensification of toxic cyanobacteria blooms has occurred over the last three decades, severely affecting coastal and lake water quality in many parts of the world. Extensive research is being conducted in an attempt to gain a better understanding of the driving forces that alter the ecological balance in water bodies and of the biological role of the secondary metabolites, toxins included, produced by the cyanobacteria. In the long-term, such knowledge may help to develop the needed procedures to restore the phytoplankton community to the pre-toxic blooms era. In the short-term, the mission of the scientific community is to develop novel approaches to mitigate the blooms and thereby restore the ability of affected communities to enjoy coastal and lake waters. Here, we critically review some of the recently proposed, currently leading, and potentially emerging mitigation approaches in-lake novel methodologies and applications relevant to drinking-water treatment.

T1  - Lung Metabolomics Profiling of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia in Fetal Rats
AN  - 2503563172
AB  - Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is characterized by the herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity during the fetal period. This competition for fetal thoracic space results in lung hypoplasia and vascular maldevelopment that can generate severe pulmonary hypertension (PH). The detailed mechanisms of CDH pathogenesis are yet to be understood. Acknowledgment of the lung metabolism during the in-utero CDH development can help to discern the CDH pathophysiology changes. Timed-pregnant dams received nitrofen or vehicle (olive oil) on E9.5 day of gestation. All fetal lungs exposed to nitrofen or vehicle control were harvested at day E21.5 by C-section and processed for metabolomics analysis using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The three groups analyzed were nitrofen-CDH (NCDH), nitrofen-control (NC), and vehicle control (VC). A total of 64 metabolites were quantified and subjected to statistical analysis. The multivariate analysis identified forty-four metabolites that were statistically different between the three groups. The highest Variable importance in projection (VIP) score (>2) metabolites were lactate, glutamate, and adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP). Fetal CDH lungs have changes related to oxidative stress, nucleotide synthesis, amino acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and glucose metabolism. This work provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms behind the CDH pathophysiology and can explore potential novel treatment targets for CDH patients.

T1  - Epigenetic regulation of retinal development
AN  - 2491031585
AB  - In the developing vertebrate retina, retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) proliferate and give rise to terminally differentiated neurons with exquisite spatio-temporal precision. Lineage commitment, fate determination and terminal differentiation are controlled by intricate crosstalk between the genome and epigenome. Indeed, epigenetic regulation plays pivotal roles in numerous cell fate specification and differentiation events in the retina. Moreover, aberrant chromatin structure can contribute to developmental disorders and retinal pathologies. In this review, we highlight recent advances in our understanding of epigenetic regulation in the retina. We also provide insight into several aspects of epigenetic-related regulation that should be investigated in future studies of retinal development and disease. Importantly, focusing on these mechanisms could contribute to the development of novel treatment strategies targeting a variety of retinal disorders.

T1  - Transgenerational Effects of Hexavalent Chromium on Marine Medaka (Oryzias melastigma) Reveal Complex Transgenerational Adaptation in Offspring
AN  - 2481308897
AB  - Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] pollution is one of most serious heavy metal pollutants in the coastal area and posed serious threats to marine organisms and human beings. Many studies have been conducted on its toxicological effects on living organisms from morphological to physiological aspects. However, there are few studies about the transgenerational toxicological of Cr(VI). In this study, we exposed adult marine medaka fishes with Cr(VI) and their offspring with Cr(VI) to examine transgenerational effects of Cr(VI). We found that there were mechanisms such as changing reproduction modes in males to compensate for impacts on the reproduction. There were differences and similarities between the parental effect and the environmental effect, with the former one causing more serious adverse effects on the offspring of Cr(VI)-exposed fish. It was noteworthy that there was an interaction between the parental and offspring treatment which leads to the attenuation of the parental effects on offspring when the offspring also underwent the same treatment. In addition, physiological adaptation has also been observed in fish to improve their fitness. Overall, effects of Cr(VI) on fish and their offspring were studied to pave a way to study the of mechanisms of adaptation.

T1  - Dictionary of Industrial Terminology
AN  - 2469531049
AB  - Greatly expanded and revised, this second edition is the most comprehensive and in-depth dictionary of industrial terms available, a must-have for any engineer, scientist, technician, or operator working in industry. 
When unclear communication occurs in industry, the problems that result can be expensive, such as costly downtime and equipment failure. Here's where the all new, fully revised and updated Holloway and Holloway's Dictionary of Industrial Terminology can eliminate much of this frustration and cost. Now, you, your staff, vendors, contract employees, and consultants can quickly refer to this glossary's more than 20,000 terms and definitions. This helpful dictionary provides a common ground for effective communication. It is an essential reference for all reliability professionals, process engineers, plant operators, and repair and maintenance personnel, and many other positions across many industries. It is ideal for engineers, managers, salespeople, technicians, students, and technical writers, politicians, and lawyers. This volume is packed with practical information. 
The alphabetically arranged entries range from a few words to a page or more. It is an essential reference for all reliability professionals, process engineers, plant operators, corrosion and lubrication personnel, and repair and maintenance personnel. The over 20,000 entries are alphabetically arranged from A to Z and have special features to encourage usage and understanding. The terms "process," "control," "reliability," and "machinery" are used broadly here, but many other categories are covered as well, such as corrosion, asset management, lubrication, quality control, process and occupational safety, just to name a few. They are supplemented by hundreds of figures (approximately 200) and tables (more than 100) that clearly demonstrate the principles & concepts behind important process control, instrumentation, reliability, machinery, asset management, lubrication, corrosion, and so forth. 
It also contains an appendix covering all journals and magazines, all societies and associations, all conferences available in these areas. It also has an appendix which covers undergraduate and post-graduate degrees in chemical engineering, reliability, and process control around the globe.

T1  - Assessment of heavy metals and its impact on DNA fragmentation in different fish species
TT  - Avaliação de metais pesados e seu impacto na fragmentação de DNA em differentes espécies de peixe
AN  - 2493868557
AB  - This study was conducted to assess water pollution by examining DNA fragmentation in selected fish organs (kidney, liver, gills, and muscle tissue) from Wallago attu, Sperata sarwari, Vulgaris vulgaris, and Labeo rohita collected from a known polluted section of the Chenab River, Pakistan, and from a control site. The fish were caught using a gill net and were assigned to three different weight groups (W1, W2, and W3) to study the degree of variation in DNA fragmentation in relation to body weight. In fish from the polluted site, DNA fragmentation was higher in kidney, liver, gills, and muscles, compared to the control. No significant DNA fragmentation was observed in fish collected from the control site. Highly significant (P < 0.01) relationship between body weight and DNA fragmentation was found in the organs of fish procured at the contaminated site. DNA fragmentation in body organs was found to be affected by the concentrations of lead, copper, nickel, and cadmium in W. attu, S. sarwari, L. rohita, and V. vulgarus harvested from Chenab River. DNA fragmentation in different freshwater fish species is therefore a reliable biomarker of water pollution.Alternate abstract:Este estudo foi conduzido para avaliar a poluição da água examinando a fragmentação do DNA em órgãos de peixes selecionados (rim, fígado, brânquias e tecido muscular) de Wallago attu, Sperata sarwari, Vulgaris vulgaris e Labeo rohita coletados de uma conhecida área poluída do rio Chenab, Paquistão e de um local de controle. Os peixes foram capturados usando uma rede branquial e foram divididos em três grupos de pesos differentes (W1, W2 e W3) para estudar o grau de variação na fragmentação do DNA em relação ao peso corporal. Nos peixes do local poluído, a fragmentação do DNA foi maior nos rins, fígado, brânquias e músculos, em comparação ao controle. Não foi observada fragmentação signifcativa do DNA em peixes coletados no local de controle. Relação altamente signifcativa (P <0,01) entre o peso corporal e a fragmentação do DNA foi encontrada nos órgãos dos peixes adquiridos no local contaminado. Verifcou-se que a fragmentação do DNA nos órgãos do corpo é afetada pelas concentrações de chumbo, cobre, níquel e cádmio em W. attu, S. sarwari, L. rohita e V. vulgarus colhidos no rio Chenab. A fragmentação do DNA em differentes espécies de peixes de água doce é, portanto, um biomarcador confável da poluição da água.

T1  - Ancient Bones:&nbsp;Unearthing the Astonishing New Story of How We Became Human
AN  - 2436199042
AB  - "Splendid and important... Scientifically rigorous and written with a clarity and candor that create a gripping tale... [Böhme's] account of the history of Europe's lost apes is imbued with the sweat, grime, and triumph that is the lot of the fieldworker, and carries great authority." —Tim Flannery, The New York Review of Books In this "fascinating forensic inquiry into human origins" (Kirkus STARRED Review), a renowned paleontologist takes readers behind-the-scenes of one of the most groundbreaking archaeological digs in recent history. Somewhere west of Munich, paleontologist Madelaine Böhme and her colleagues dig for clues to the origins of humankind. What they discover is beyond anything they ever imagined: the twelve-million-year-old bones of Danuvius guggenmosi make headlines around the world. This ancient ape defies prevailing theories of human history—his skeletal adaptations suggest a new common ancestor between apes and humans, one that dwelled in Europe, not Africa. Might the great apes that traveled from Africa to Europe before Danuvius's time be the key to understanding our own origins? All this and more is explored in Ancient Bones. Using her expertise as a paleoclimatologist and paleontologist, Böhme pieces together an awe-inspiring picture of great apes that crossed land bridges from Africa to Europe millions of years ago, evolving in response to the challenging conditions they found. She also takes us behind the scenes of her research, introducing us to former theories of human evolution (complete with helpful maps and diagrams), and walks us through musty museum overflow storage where she finds forgotten fossils with yellowed labels, before taking us along to the momentous dig where she and the team unearthed Danuvius guggenmosi himself—and the incredible reverberations his discovery caused around the world. Praise for Ancient Bones: "Readable and thought-provoking. Madelaine Böhme is an iconoclast whose fossil discoveries have challenged long-standing ideas on the origins of the ancestors of apes and humans." —Steve Brusatte, New York Times-bestselling author of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs "An inherently fascinating, impressively informative, and exceptionally thought-provoking read." —Midwest Book Review "An impressive introduction to the burgeoning recalibration of paleoanthropology." —Kirkus Reviews (starred review)

T1  - Seasonal Variability in Benthic–Pelagic Coupling: Quantifying Organic Matter Inputs to the Seafloor and Benthic Macrofauna Using a Multi-Marker Approach
AN  - 2409767726
AB  - The exchange between the water column and the seafloor is a complex process, and is particularly intensive in the shallow waters of highly productive coastal areas, where the temporal variability in the inputs of pelagic organic matter will determine many aspects of the benthic community structure. However, few studies have focused on the seasonality of inputs of organic matter to the seafloor, and on the consequent dynamics and time scales of response of benthic consumers. We conducted a one-year study where we repeatedly sampled multiple organic compounds traditionally used as markers to study the link between the pelagic organic matter inputs and the seafloor, and the potential response of benthic macrofauna to seasonal trends in phytoplankton biomass. We simultaneously quantified the particulate organic matter in the water column, the sinking material and different seafloor compartments, and analysed it for pigments, organic carbon and nitrogen content, C/N ratio, and stable isotopes. Seafloor sediment was also analysed for total lipids, and the dominant macrobenthic species for isotopic signatures. Results showed a major deposition of fresh organic matter during the spring bloom followed by more degraded organic matter inputs during the late summer bloom and even lower quality of the organic matter reaching the seafloor during winter. Strong positive relationships between water column and sedimentary pigments suggest that phytoplankton was the main source of carbon to the seafloor. The isotopic signatures of the dominant macrobenthic species suggest a fast response to the organic matter inputs from the water column. However, different species responded differently to the deposition of organic matter. Macoma balthica and Marenzelleria spp. fed on more reworked and degraded sedimentary material, while Monoporeia affinis showed a shift in the feeding habits according to its life stage, with adult individuals feeding on fresher material than juveniles did. Our study highlights the seasonal variability of the benthic-pelagic coupling and the utility of a multi-marker approach to follow the temporal inputs of organic matter from the water column to the seafloor and benthic organisms.

T1  - Sequence count data are poorly fit by the negative binomial distribution
AN  - 2396928107
AB  - Sequence count data are commonly modelled using the negative binomial (NB) distribution. Several empirical studies, however, have demonstrated that methods based on the NB-assumption do not always succeed in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at its nominal level. In this paper, we propose a dedicated statistical goodness of fit test for the NB distribution in regression models and demonstrate that the NB-assumption is violated in many publicly available RNA-Seq and 16S rRNA microbiome datasets. The zero-inflated NB distribution was not found to give a substantially better fit. We also show that the NB-based tests perform worse on the features for which the NB-assumption was violated than on the features for which no significant deviation was detected. This gives an explanation for the poor behaviour of NB-based tests in many published evaluation studies. We conclude that nonparametric tests should be preferred over parametric methods.

AB  - The ability to distinguish between different migratory behaviours (e.g., anadromy and potamodromy) in fish can provide important insights into the ecology, evolution, and conservation of many aquatic species. We present a simple stable carbon isotope (δ13C) approach for distinguishing between sockeye (anadromous ocean migrants) and kokanee (potamodromous freshwater residents), two migratory ecotypes of Oncorhynchus nerka (Salmonidae) that is applicable throughout most of their range across coastal regions of the North Pacific Ocean. Analyses of kokanee (n = 239) and sockeye (n = 417) from 87 sites spanning the North Pacific (Russia to California) show that anadromous and potamodromous ecotypes are broadly distinguishable on the basis of the δ13C values of their scale and bone collagen. We present three case studies demonstrating how this approach can address questions in archaeology, archival, and conservation research. Relative to conventional methods for determining migratory status, which typically apply chemical analyses to otoliths or involve genetic analyses of tissues, the δ13C approach outlined here has the benefit of being non-lethal (when applied to scales), cost-effective, widely available commercially, and should be much more broadly accessible for addressing archaeological questions since the recovery of otoliths at archaeological sites is rare.

T1  - Remote Sensing of Ice Conditions in the Southeastern Baltic Sea and in the Curonian Lagoon and Validation of SAR-Based Ice Thickness Products
AN  - 2461837691
AB  - Here we analyze ice conditions in the Southeastern Baltic (SEB) Sea and in the Curonian Lagoon (CL) using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data combined with in-situ measurements from coastal stations during four winter seasons between 2009–2013. As shown, the ice conditions in the SEB and in the CL are strongly varying from year to year and do not always correlate with each other. In the SEB, ice cover may form only within 5–15 km band along the coast or spread up to 100 km offshore covering almost the entire region. The mean ice season duration here is 45 days. The CL is almost fully ice-covered every year apart of its northern part subjected to sea water inflow and active shipping. The ice regime is also more stable here, however, it also possesses multiple periods of partial melting and re-freezing. In this study we also perform a validation of three SAR-based ice thickness products (Envisat ASAR 0.5-km and 1-km, and RADARSAT-2 0.5-km) produced by the Finnish Meteorological Institute versus in-situ measurements in the CL. As shown, all satellite products perform rather well for the periods of gradual ice thickness growth. When the ice thickness grows rapidly, all products underestimate the observed values by 10–20 cm (20–50%). The best results were obtained for the RADARSAT-2 ice thickness product with the highest R2 value (0.68) and the root mean square error around 8 cm. The results of the study clearly show that multi-mission SAR data are very useful for spatial and temporal analysis of the ice regime in coastal waters and semi-enclosed shallow water bodies where the number of field observations is insufficient or lacking.

T1  - Spatio-Temporal Variability of Phytoplankton Primary Production in Baltic Lakes Using Sentinel-3 OLCI Data
AN  - 2429500726
AB  - Phytoplankton primary production (PP) in lakes play an important role in the global carbon cycle. However, monitoring the PP in lakes with traditional complicated and costly in situ sampling methods are impossible due to the large number of lakes worldwide (estimated to be 117 million lakes). In this study, bio-optical modelling and remote sensing data (Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) was combined to investigate the spatial and temporal variation of PP in four Baltic lakes during 2018. The model used has three input parameters: concentration of chlorophyll-a, the diffuse attenuation coefficient, and incident downwelling irradiance. The largest of our studied lakes, Võrtsjärv (270 km2), had the highest total yearly estimated production (61 Gg C y−1) compared to the smaller lakes Lubans (18 Gg C y−1) and Razna (7 Gg C y−1). However, the most productive was the smallest studied, Lake Burtnieks (40.2 km2); although the total yearly production was 13 Gg C y−1, the daily average areal production was 910 mg C m−2 d−1 in 2018. Even if lake size plays a significant role in the total PP of the lake, the abundance of small and medium-sized lakes would sum up to a significant contribution of carbon fixation. Our method is applicable to larger regions to monitor the spatial and temporal variability of lake PP.

T1  - Larval Geoduck (Panopea generosa) Proteomic Response to Ciliates
AN  - 2387631102
AB  - The innate immune response is active in invertebrate larvae from early development. Induction of immune response pathways may occur as part of the natural progression of larval development, but an up-regulation of pathways can also occur in response to a pathogen. Here, we took advantage of a protozoan ciliate infestation of a larval geoduck clam culture in a commercial hatchery to investigate the molecular underpinnings of the innate immune response of the larvae to the pathogen. Larval proteomes were analyzed on days 4–10 post-fertilization; ciliates were present on days 8 and 10 post-fertilization. Through comparisons with larval cultures that did not encounter ciliates, proteins implicated in the response to ciliate presence were identified using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Ciliate response proteins included many associated with ribosomal synthesis and protein translation, suggesting the importance of protein synthesis during the larval immune response. There was also an increased abundance of proteins typically associated with the stress and immune responses during ciliate exposure, such as heat shock proteins, glutathione metabolism, and the reactive oxygen species response. These findings provide a basic understanding of the bivalve molecular response to a mortality-inducing ciliate and improved characterization of the ontogenetic development of the innate immune response.

T1  - Terminal-Repeat Retrotransposons in Miniature (TRIMs) in bivalves
AN  - 2330970601
AB  - Terminal repeat retrotransposons in miniature (TRIMs) are small non-autonomous LTR retrotransposons consisting of two terminal direct repeats surrounding a short internal domain. The detection and characterization of these elements has been mainly limited to plants. Here we present the first finding of a TRIM element in bivalves, and among the first known in the kingdom Animalia. Class Bivalvia has high ecological and commercial importance in marine ecosystems and aquaculture, and, in recent years, an increasing number of genomic studies has addressed to these organisms. We have identified biv-TRIM in several bivalve species: Donax trunculus, Ruditapes decussatus, R. philippinarum, Venerupis corrugata, Polititapes rhomboides, Venus verrucosa, Dosinia exoleta, Glycymeris glycymeris, Cerastoderma edule, Magallana gigas, Mytilus galloprovincialis. biv-TRIM has several characteristics typical for this group of elements, exhibiting different variations. In addition to canonically structured elements, solo-TDRs and tandem repeats were detected. The presence of this element in the genome of each species is <1%. The phylogenetic analysis showed a complex clustering pattern of biv-TRIM elements, and indicates the involvement of horizontal transfer in the spreading of this element.

T1  - Respiratory Biology of Animals:&nbsp;Evolutionary and Functional Morphology
AN  - 2290117171
AB  - Oxygen uptake for metabolic energy demand and the elimination of the resulting carbon dioxide is one of the essential processes in all higher life forms; in the case of animals, everything from protozoans to insects and vertebrates including humans. Respiratory Biology of Animals provides a contemporary and truly integrative approach to the topic, adopting a strong evolutionary theme. It covers aerobic metabolism at all levels, from gas exchange organs such as skin,gills, and lungs to mitochondria - the site of cellular respiration. The book also describes the functional morphology and physiology of the circulatory system, which often contains gas-carrying pigments and is important for pH regulation in the organism. A final section describes the evolution ofanimal respiratory systems. Throughout the book, examples are selected from the entire breadth of the animal kingdom, identifying common themes that transcend taxonomy.Respiratory Biology of Animals is an accessible supplementary text suitable for both senior undergraduate and graduate students taking courses in respiratory biology, comparative animal physiology, and environmental physiology. It is also of relevance and use to the many professional academics requiring a concise but authoritative overview of the topic.

T1  - Long-Term Phytoplankton Dynamics in a Complex Temporal Realm
AN  - 2311941053
AB  - Faced with an environment of accelerated change, the long-term dynamics of biotic communities can be approached to build a consistent and causal picture of the communities’ life. We have undertaken a 25-year monthly-sampling study on the phytoplankton of a meso-oligotrophic lake, paying attention to controlling factors of overall biomass (TB) and taxonomical group biomass (TGBs). Long-term series included decreased trends of TB and TGBs, and multi-scale periodicity. A decadal TB periodicity emerged related to nitrogen concentration and Cryptophytes. Annual periodicities were mainly related to air and water temperature controlling the abundance of Chlorophytes or Dinoflagellates. Intra-annual cycles could arise from autogenic processes. The analysis by periods revealed relevant dynamics (for example, Diatom periodicities), hidden in the analysis of the complete series. These results allow us to establish that: i) two organizational levels of phytoplankton change differently in time scales from months to decades; ii) controlling factors (climate, water physics and chemistry) act at different time scales and on different TGBs, and iii) different combinations of the “taxonomical group-control factor-trend and periodicity” set throughout the studied time explain total biomass dynamics. A holistic approach (multiple complementary analyses) is necessary to disentangle the different actors and relationships that explain non-stationary long-term phytoplankton dynamics.

T1  - Cavitation-induced traumatic cerebral contusion and intracerebral hemorrhage in the rat brain by using an off-the-shelf clinical shockwave device
AN  - 2310637481
AB  - Traumatic cerebral contusion and intracerebral hemorrhages (ICH) commonly result from traumatic brain injury and are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Current animal models require craniotomy and provide less control over injury severity. This study proposes a highly reproducible and controllable traumatic contusion and ICH model using non-invasive extracorporeal shockwaves (ESWs). Rat heads were exposed to ESWs generated by an off-the-shelf clinical device plus intravenous injection of microbubbles to enhance the cavitation effect for non-invasive induction of injury. Results indicate that injury severity can be effectively adjusted by using different ESW parameters. Moreover, the location or depth of injury can be purposefully determined by changing the focus of the concave ESW probe. Traumatic contusion and ICH were confirmed by H&E staining. Interestingly, the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells (apoptotic cell death) peaked one day after ESW exposure, while Iba1-positive cells (reactive microglia) and GFAP-positive cells (astrogliosis) respectively peaked seven and fourteen days after exposure. Cytokine assay showed significantly increased expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. The extent of brain edema was characterized with magnetic resonance imaging. Conclusively, the proposed non-invasive and highly reproducible preclinical model effectively simulates the mechanism of closed head injury and provides focused traumatic contusion and ICH.

T1  - Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Ecology
AN  - 2170928359
AB  - An authoritative overview of the ecological activities of microbes in the biosphere Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Ecology presents a broad overview of microbial activity and microbes' interactions with their environments and communities. Adopting an integrative approach, this text covers both conventional ecological issues as well as cross-disciplinary investigations that combine facets of microbiology, ecology, environmental science and engineering, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Focusing primarily on single-cell forms of prokaryotes -- and cellular forms of algae, fungi, and protozoans -- this book enables readers to gain insight into the fundamental methodologies for the characterization of microorganisms in the biosphere. The authors draw from decades of experience to examine the environmental processes mediated by microorganisms and explore the interactions between microorganisms and higher life forms. Highly relevant to modern readers, this book examines topics including the ecology of microorganisms in engineered environments, microbial phylogeny and interactions, microbial processes in relation to environmental pollution, and many more. Now in its second edition, this book features updated references and major revisions to chapters on assessing microbial communities, community relationships, and their global impact. New content such as effective public communication of research findings and advice on scientific article review equips readers with practical real-world skills. Explores the activities of microorganisms in specific environments with case studies and actual research data Highlights how prominent microbial biologists address significant microbial ecology issues Offers guidance on scientific communication, including scientific presentations and grant preparation Includes plentiful illustrations and examples of microbial interactions, community structures, and human-bacterial connections Provides chapter summaries, review questions, selected reading lists, a complete glossary, and critical thinking exercises Environmental Microbiology and Microbial Ecology is an ideal textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses in biology, microbiology, ecology, and environmental science, while also serving as a current and informative reference for microbiologists, cell and molecular biologists, ecologists, and environmental professionals.

T1  - Miocene syn-rift lacustrine sediments in the Mecsek Mts. (SW Hungary)
AN  - 2682969207
AB  - The Pannonian Basin, a major back-arc basin in the Alpine–Carpathian orogenic belt, experienced its syn-rift phase during the Early–Middle Miocene. Studying coeval sediments can provide important information on the initiation of the extension. This paper investigates syn-rift deposits in the Mecsek Mts. in SW Hungary from a tectono-sedimentary aspect, using stratigraphy, palaeontology and structural observations to constrain palaeoenvironments and their tectonic background. Our study shows that in the Mecsek area the widespread Early Miocene fluvial sedimentation was not directly followed by inundation by the Central Paratethys sea, instead, a phase of lacustrine deposition in the Karpatian–Early Badenian (late Burdigalian–early Langhian) preceded the marine flooding. The lake sediments have a low-diversity but abundant, endemic mollusc and ostracod fauna, dominated by the bivalve Congeria boeckhi and the gastropod Ferebithynia vadászi. Identical faunas at various sites indicate that “Lake Mecsek” was a single water body, covering the present-day Mecsek Mts. and their surroundings. Wedge-shaped clastic bodies along faults, fault scarp breccias and semi-soft sediment deformations suggest that extensional tectonic activity related to the rifting of the Pannonian Basin played a role in lake basin formation. The accumulation of lakes was probably also enhanced by increased precipitation during the Miocene Climatic Optimum. The Central Paratethys flooded the area in the Badenian (Langhian) and deposited normal marine sediments over the lacustrine ones. Considering the fauna, the sedimentary succession, the structural background and evolution history, the Mecsek area seems to be part of the Illyrian bioprovince and related to the Dinaride Lake System.

T1  - Oyster (Crassostrea gasar) gastrointestinal tract microbiota and immunological responses after antibiotic administration
AN  - 2204522017
AB  - Microbiota, the microorganisms that colonize living organisms. Oysters rely exclusively on an innate immune system. This study characterized the cultivable gastrointestinal tract microbiota (GTM) of the oyster Crassostrea gasar and evaluated their influence on immune responses. Antibiotics were used to reduce or alter the microbiota during in vitro and in vivo assays. Haemocyte viability, concentration, and phagocytic capacity, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), were evaluated in antibiotic-treated and control oysters. Microbiological analysis of the gastrointestinal tract was also performed; bacteria were selected using culture media and were identified by 16S ribosomal DNA. The results showed that the antibiotics eliminated bacteria in vitro but increased their concentrations in vivo. The GTM was composed of 26% amylolytic bacteria, 21% lipolytic bacteria, 18% proteolytic bacteria, 18% cellulolytic bacteria and 17% lactic acid bacteria; there were no differences in the amounts of these bacterial types between the control and treated oysters. Three major bacterial phyla, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, and seven genera, Labrenzia, Pseudomonas, Halomonas, Shewanella, Vibrio, Bacillus, and Micrococcus, were detected. The concentration, viability, and phagocytic capacity of hemocytes and the production of ROS were not significantly altered by antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, the antibiotics altered the number of heterotrophic bacteria without changing hemocyte function, suggesting that this assay could be useful for verifying the influence of microbiota in host-parasite interactions.

T1  - The effect of the physicochemical conditions variations on the behavior of heavy metals trapped in polluted fluvial system sediments: the case of Oued Sebou, Morocco
AN  - 2167567466
AB  - This study was an attempt to understand the factors influencing the heavy metal distribution in polluted fluvial system sediments. Various biogeochemical processes and anthropogenic factors were playing an important role in altering the concentration of heavy metals in the sediments. This paper has two objectives: The first one is to investigate the effect of the variation in the physicochemical conditions on the speciation of trace elements trapped in the sediments of the Sebou River. The second one is to study the kinetics mobilization of these heavy metals. Batch resuspension experiments were conducted in order to investigate the release of heavy metals from a polluted anoxic sediment submitted to different physicochemical conditions variations. It has been revealed that in oxygenated environment, sediments were oxidized which cause the release of some heavy metals, but their concentrations, as dissolved phase, were sustained constant or were increased with time. However, in acidic and anaerobic environment, most of the metallic trace elements were released together with the iron and the manganese, but some of these elements like chromium were precipitated. However, some of other elements were maintained in solution, which represents a real human health risk.

T1  - Novel chitosan–cellulose nanofiber self-healing hydrogels to correlate self-healing properties of hydrogels with neural regeneration effects
AN  - 2499401227
AB  - Biodegradable self-healing hydrogels are attractive materials for tissue repair; however, the impact of the self-healing abilities of hydrogels on tissue repair is not clear. In this study, we prepared novel chitosan–cellulose nanofiber (CS–CNF) composite self-healing hydrogels with the same modulus (approximately 2 kPa) but tunable self-healing properties. By adding a low amount of CNFs (0.06–0.15 wt%) in the pristine chitosan (CS) self-healing hydrogel, the reversible dynamic Schiff bonding, strain sensitivity, and self-healing of the hydrogel are obviously affected. Neural stem cells embedded in the CS–CNF hydrogel with better self-healing properties reveal significantly enhanced oxygen metabolism as well as neural differentiation. The differentiation of neural stem cells is highly correlated with their metabolic change in the self-healing hydrogel. Moreover, the neural regeneration effect of the optimized CS–CNF hydrogel with 0.09 wt% CNFs and the best self-healing properties show a 50% improvement over the pristine CS hydrogel in the zebrafish brain injury model. A mechanism is proposed to interpret the tunable self-healing properties of CS–CNF hydrogels with stiffness maintained in a similar range. The new self-healing hydrogels help to clarify the role of self-healing in the biological performance of hydrogels as well as provide design rationale for hydrogels with better injectability and tissue regeneration potential.Hydrogels: Nanofibers help stitch tissue togetherThe properties of an injectable and self-healing polymer that can aid tissue regeneration are improved by adding nanofibers, according to Taiwanese researchers. Hydrogels are firm but elastic materials made of a tangle of polymer chains bonded together. These bonds can reform when the material is damaged. These self-healing hydrogels are useful for wound healing and can provide a scaffold for tissue engineering. Shan-hui Hsu from the National Taiwan University Taipei, and co-workers improved the self-healing of a hydrogel made from chitosan, a polymer derived from the shells of sea crustaceans, by adding small amounts of cellulose nanofibers. The team demonstrated that the differentiation of nerve stem cells embedded within the hydrogel was significantly enhanced when the cellulose nanofibers were present. The composite hydrogel aided functional recovery in the zebrafish brain injury model.

T1  - Novel chitosan–cellulose nanofiber self-healing hydrogels to correlate self-healing properties of hydrogels with neural regeneration effects
AN  - 2236156066
AB  - Biodegradable self-healing hydrogels are attractive materials for tissue repair; however, the impact of the self-healing abilities of hydrogels on tissue repair is not clear. In this study, we prepared novel chitosan–cellulose nanofiber (CS–CNF) composite self-healing hydrogels with the same modulus (approximately 2 kPa) but tunable self-healing properties. By adding a low amount of CNFs (0.06–0.15 wt%) in the pristine chitosan (CS) self-healing hydrogel, the reversible dynamic Schiff bonding, strain sensitivity, and self-healing of the hydrogel are obviously affected. Neural stem cells embedded in the CS–CNF hydrogel with better self-healing properties reveal significantly enhanced oxygen metabolism as well as neural differentiation. The differentiation of neural stem cells is highly correlated with their metabolic change in the self-healing hydrogel. Moreover, the neural regeneration effect of the optimized CS–CNF hydrogel with 0.09 wt% CNFs and the best self-healing properties show a 50% improvement over the pristine CS hydrogel in the zebrafish brain injury model. A mechanism is proposed to interpret the tunable self-healing properties of CS–CNF hydrogels with stiffness maintained in a similar range. The new self-healing hydrogels help to clarify the role of self-healing in the biological performance of hydrogels as well as provide design rationale for hydrogels with better injectability and tissue regeneration potential.Hydrogels: Nanofibers help stitch tissue togetherThe properties of an injectable and self-healing polymer that can aid tissue regeneration are improved by adding nanofibers, according to Taiwanese researchers. Hydrogels are firm but elastic materials made of a tangle of polymer chains bonded together. These bonds can reform when the material is damaged. These self-healing hydrogels are useful for wound healing and can provide a scaffold for tissue engineering. Shan-hui Hsu from the National Taiwan University Taipei, and co-workers improved the self-healing of a hydrogel made from chitosan, a polymer derived from the shells of sea crustaceans, by adding small amounts of cellulose nanofibers. The team demonstrated that the differentiation of nerve stem cells embedded within the hydrogel was significantly enhanced when the cellulose nanofibers were present. The composite hydrogel aided functional recovery in the zebrafish brain injury model.

T1  - Regional trade of medicinal plants has facilitated the retention of traditional knowledge: case study in Gilgit-Baltistan Pakistan
AN  - 2183275042
AB  - Background 
The ethnic groups in Gilgit-Baltistan have been utilizing local resources in their centuries-old traditional healing system. Most tribes within these ethnic groups still rely on traditional healing systems. We aim to understand the current status, uses, and abundance of medicinal plants, associated traditional knowledge, and trade.
 Materials and methods 
The study incorporated over 300 local community members (70% men and 30% women) in focused group discussions, semi-structured interviews, and homework assignments for 8th to 12th grade students to document traditional knowledge (TK) in six districts in Northeast Pakistan. We calculated various indices such as informant consensus factor, use value, relative frequency of citation, and CoKriging. These indices, along with repetitively used medicinal plants, were used to analyze differences in studied locations.
 Results 
Most of the community members still rely on traditional medication in the study areas. However, we found the highest number of medicinal plants used in Skardu and Gilgit compared to other districts and these two districts also represent trade centers and a highly populated area regarding medicinal plants. Results indicate connection amongst the surveyed villages signifying mixing of knowledge from different sources, with certain areas more influenced by traditional Chinese medicine and others more by Ayurveda and Unani.
 Conclusion 
TK is mostly retained with elder community members; however, those directly linked with market value chain retain rich knowledge on traditional use of the medicinal plants from the region. Major trade centers in the region also coincide with a high density of medicinal plant occurrence, knowledge, and higher utilization. Therefore, with the increasing trade in medicinal plant in the region, there is potential for rejuvenation of this knowledge and of plant use in the region.

T1  - Proteinaceous Nano container Encapsulate Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons
AN  - 2174276683
AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are toxic, mutagenic and among the most damaging chemical compounds with regard to living organisms. Because of their persistence and wide distribution removal from the environment is an important challenge. Here we report a new Nano container matrix based on the deep sea archaea-derived RHCC-Nanotube (RHCC-NT), which rapidly and preferentially binds low molecular weight PAHs. Under controlled-laboratory conditions and using fluorescence spectroscopy in combination with X-ray crystallography and MD simulations, we quantified the real-time binding of low molecular weight PAHs (2–4 rings) to our substrate. Binding coefficients ranged from 5.4 ± 1.6 (fluorene) to 32 ± 7.0 μM (acenaphthylene) and a binding capacity of 85 pmoles PAH per mg RHCC-NT, or 2.12 μmoles in a standard 25 mg sampler. The uptake rate of pyrene was calculated to be 1.59 nmol/hr∙mol RHCC-NT (at 10  C). Our results clearly show that RHCC-NT is uniquely suited as a monitoring matrix for low molecular weight PAHs.

T1  - Assessment of oxygen consumption in response to progressive hypoxia
AN  - 2159700783
AB  - A new method is presented for describing the rate of oxygen consumption in response to progressive hypoxia. The method consists of screening candidate functions describing the relationship between Vo2 (oxygen consumption rate) and Po2 (ambient oxygen concentration) by testing each for fit to observed data for a single curve and the function that best fits is chosen using lowest AICc value as the criterion. Descriptive statistics are then extracted from the selected function that best describes the pattern present in the curve. Several new descriptive statistics for the pattern of response are proposed which are based on the null model of simple diffusion and no regulation. The method quantifies deviation from the null model at each point on the curve and measures both positive and negative deviation which occur when the curve changes more slowly or more rapidly than the null model predicts, respectively. The new descriptive statistics generalize the traditional one used in the past, the critical oxygen tension (Pc), and allow interpretation of a variety of shapes of curves which cannot be analyzed with conventional methods. Because the method is descriptive, it does not implicate any specific mechanisms in generating the response. The method is applied to data from 68 animals in 14 different species groups reported in the literature. The overall results suggest the existence of substantial diversity in response types among animals, which requires a more complex description than has traditionally been used.

T1  - Establishing spatial and temporal patterns in Microcystis sediment seed stock viability and their relationship to subsequent bloom development in Western Lake Erie
AN  - 2136547100
AB  - This study assessed the distribution, abundance, and viability of pre- and post-overwintering Microcystis sediment seed stocks in Western Lake Erie and how these variables are potentially related to past and subsequent bloom formation. We conducted a two-year spatiotemporal survey of vegetative seed stocks in Western Lake Erie, the region where annual algal blooms generally develop. Sediment was collected from 16 sites covering an area of 375 km2 and water column depths ranging from 3–9 meters. Sample collection occurred in November 2014, April 2015, November 2015, and April 2016. The abundance of total and potentially-toxic Microcystis cell equivalents were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A series of laboratory experiments using lake sediment were conducted to assess the viability of Microcystis vegetative seed stocks. Across all sampling periods, the abundance of total Microcystis in the sediment ranged from 6.6 x 104 to 1.7 x 109 cell equivalents g-1, and potentially-toxic Microcystis ranged from 1.4 x 103 to 4.7 x 106 cell equivalents g-1. The percent potentially-toxic Microcystis in the sediment ranged from <1% to 68% across all samples. Total Microcystis abundance diminished significantly over winter with densities in spring nearly 10 times less than the previous fall. However, despite cell loss from fall to spring, lab experiments demonstrated that remaining non-toxic and potentially-toxic cells were viable after the overwintering period. Further, lab grow-out experiments indicate that potentially-toxic strains recruited at a slightly higher rate than non-toxic strains, and may in part, contribute to the pattern of higher relative toxicity during early stages of the blooms. The abundance and distribution of overwintering cells did not correlate strongly to areas in the lake where subsequent summer blooms were most persistent. However, numerical analysis suggests that recruitment of benthic overwintering populations could help explain a portion of the initial rapid increase in bloom biomass and the spatial extent of this bloom initiation, particularly when recruitment is paired with subsequent growth in appropriate water column conditions.

T1  - The Three-Minute Outdoorsman Returns:&nbsp;From Mammoth on the Menu to the Benefits of Moose Drool
AN  - 2133253026
AB  - Spending time in nature can raise some serious questions. After contemplating your own mortality, you may start to wonder: Why don’t deer noses freeze in the winter? What does mammoth taste like? Do fish feel pain? These are important questions, and Robert M. Zink has the answers. Bringing together the common and the enigmatic, The Three-Minute Outdoorsman Returns includes over seventy three-minute essays in which Zink responds to the queries that have yet to cross your mind. Drawing on his zoological background, Zink condenses the latest scientific discoveries and delivers useful, entertaining information on the great outdoors. Can a sheep’s horns be too big? Was the Labrador duck a hybrid? Why did I miss that clay target? A large section on deer covers topics ranging from deer birth control backfiring, new information on Chronic Wasting Disease, supplemental feeding, and deer genetics. Other essays explore land, aquatic animals, and humanity’s relationship with nature, thus making this book of wild science an essential for any outdoors person.

T1  - Soft Living Architecture:&nbsp;An Alternative View of Bio-Informed Practice
AN  - 2176923911
AB  - Soft Living Architecture explores the invention of new architectures based on living processes. It crafts a unique intersection between two fast-developing disciplines: biomimicry and biodesign in architecture, and bioinformatics and natural computing in the natural sciences.This is the first book to examine both the theory and methodology of architecture and design working directly with the natural world. It explores a range of approaches from the use of life-like systems in building design to the employment of actual growing and living cell and tissue cultures as architectural materials - creating architecture that can change, learn and grow with us. The use of 'living architecture' is cutting-edge and speculative, yet it is also inspiring a growing number of designers worldwide to adopt alternative perspectives on sustainability and environmental design. The book examines the ethical and theoretical issues arising alongside case-studies of experimental practice, to explore what we mean by 'natural' in the Anthropocene, and raise deep questions about the nature of design and the design of nature. This provocative and at times controversial book shows why it will become ever more necessary to embrace living processes in architecture if we are to thrive in a sustainable future.

T1  - Molecular Mechanisms Involved in Oxidative Stress-Associated Liver Injury Induced by Chinese Herbal Medicine: An Experimental Evidence-Based Literature Review and Network Pharmacology Study
AN  - 2126865986
AB  - Oxidative stress, defined as a disequilibrium between pro-oxidants and antioxidants, can result in histopathological lesions with a broad spectrum, ranging from asymptomatic hepatitis to hepatocellular carcinoma in an orchestrated manner. Although cells are equipped with sophisticated strategies to maintain the redox biology under normal conditions, the abundance of redox-sensitive xenobiotics, such as medicinal ingredients originated from herbs or animals, can dramatically invoke oxidative stress. Growing evidence has documented that the hepatotoxicity can be triggered by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) during treating various diseases. Meanwhile, TCM-dependent hepatic disorder represents a strong correlation with oxidative stress, especially the persistent accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species. Of note, since TCM-derived compounds with their modulated targets are greatly diversified among themselves, it is complicated to elaborate the potential pathological mechanism. In this regard, data mining approaches, including network pharmacology and bioinformatics enrichment analysis have been utilized to scientifically disclose the underlying pathogenesis. Herein, top 10 principal TCM-modulated targets for oxidative hepatotoxicity including superoxide dismutases (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), reactive oxygen species (ROS), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), Bax, caspase-3, Bcl-2, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), and nitric oxide (NO) have been identified. Furthermore, hepatic metabolic dysregulation may be the predominant pathological mechanism involved in TCM-induced hepatotoxic impairment.

T1  - Understanding Animal Behaviour
AN  - 2268606606
AB  - This accessible introduction to animal behaviour provides an authoritative yet reader-friendly guide for the interested naturalist. It presents current knowledge about the way animals behave and will enable the reader to derive more pleasure from their observations of animals by gaining a deeper understanding of their behaviour. The concepts are presented in an easily appreciated way with which everyone can associate.In the first part of the book, the author explores how animals behave by considering the physical processes involved in the way animals perceive their environment and what determines how they respond to it. This is followed by the 'why' of animal behaviour in which the author examines many topics under the overall issue of expressing behaviour, and the evolutionary forces that have shaped - and continue to shape - the detailed form of more complex behaviours. Therefore questions such as why animals forage in the way they do and how that foraging pattern may be refined to optimal efficiency; why animals adopt a particular reproductive strategy and breeding behaviour and why some animals live as solitary individuals, while others live in groups and so on. The book is copiously illustrated throughout in support and interpretation of the text. While the pictures enhance understanding of the written text, the text also showcases the exquisite illustrations of wildlife artist Catherine Putman.

T1  - Diffusion Dynamics and Optimal Coupling in Multiplex Networks with Directed Layers
AN  - 2550613863
AB  - Multiplex networks have been intensively studied during the last few years as they offer a more realistic representation of many interdependent and multilevel complex networked systems. However, even if most real networks have some degree of directionality, the vast majority of the existent literature deals with multiplex networks where all layers are undirected. Here, we study the dynamics of diffusion processes acting on coupled multilayer networks where at least one layer consists of a directed graph; we call these directed multiplex networks. We reveal a new and unexpected signature of diffusion dynamics on directed multiplex networks, namely, that different from their undirected counterparts, they can exhibit a nonmonotonic rate of convergence to steady state as a function of the degree of coupling, resulting in a faster diffusion at an intermediate degree of coupling than when the two layers are fully coupled. We use synthetic multiplex examples and real-world topologies to illustrate the characteristics of the underlying dynamics that give rise to a regime in which an optimal coupling exists. We further provide analytical and numerical evidence that this new phenomenon is solely a property of directed multiplex, where at least one of the layers exhibits sufficient directionality quantified by a normalized metric of asymmetry in directional path lengths. Given the ubiquity of both directed and multilayer networks in nature, our results have important implications for studying the dynamics of multilevel complex systems.Alternate abstract:Plain Language Summary
Complex dynamical systems that originate in geophysical, biological, climatic, and social environments often exhibit a networked structure arising from interactions between constituent subsystems. In turn, the analysis of such structures reveals mechanisms behind the properties of the underlying natural processes. Of particular interest is a special class of multilayer networks known as multiplex, where layers consist of an identical set of corresponding nodes, through which they interact, while individually having different topological structure. Here, we initiate the study of multiplex networks with directed layers that are typical of many natural and engineered systems, including geophysical transport on river networks, food webs, gene regulation, and social dynamics.
We show that in contrast to undirected multiplex networks, where the fastest diffusion corresponds to maximal layer coupling, directed multiplex networks explain the emergence of the fastest diffusion at intermediate coupling. We attribute this new phenomenon to the anisotropy inherited by the directionality of the layers, which speeds up mixing via propagation in different directions over separate layers.
Our results have implications in transport dynamics of many social, biological, and natural networks that, more often than not, exhibit process directionality. In particular, our results raise new questions as to whether natural complex systems self-organize into configurations that enhance diffusivity, and they also suggest ways to design artificial networks to operate at an optimal degree of coupling for fastest transport.

T1  - The Biology and Identification of the Coccidia (Apicomplexa) of Carnivores of the World
AN  - 2134052818
AB  - The fundamental concept of The Biology and Identification of the Coccidia (Apicomplexa) of Carnivores of the World is to provide an up-to-date reference guide to the identification, taxonomy, and known biology of apicomplexan intestinal and tissue parasites of carnivores including, but not limited to, geographic distribution, prevalence, sporulation, prepatent and patent periods, site(s) of infection in the definitive and (if known) intermediate hosts, endogenous development, cross-transmission, pathology, phylogeny, and (if known) their treatments. These data will allow easy parasite recognition with a summation of virtually everything now known about the biology of each parasite species covered. The last (very modest) and only treatise published on this subject was in 1981 so this book fills a fundamental gap in our knowledge of what is now known, and what is not, about the coccidian parasites that infect and sometimes kill carnivores and/or their prey that can harbor intermediate stages, including many domestic and game animals. Offers line drawings and photomicrographs of many parasite species that will allow easy diagnosis and identification by both laypersons and professionals (veterinarians, wildlife biologists, etc.) Presents a complete historical rendition of all known publications on carnivore coccidia for all carnivore families and evaluates the scientific and scholarly merit of each apicomplexan species relative to the current body of knowledge Provides a complete species analysis and their known biology of all coccidia described from each carnivore lineage and species Reviews the most current taxonomy of carnivores and their phylogenetic relationships to help assess host-specificity patterns that may be apparent Evaluates what little cross-transmission work is available to help understand the complexities of those coccidians that use two hosts (e.g., Sarcocystis, Besnoitia, and others) Provides known treatments for the various parasite genera/species

T1  - The Marsh Builders:&nbsp;The Fight for Clean Water, Wetlands, and Wildlife
AN  - 2134714033
AB  - Swamps and marshes once covered vast stretches of the North American landscape. The destruction of these habitats, long seen as wastelands that harbored deadly disease, accelerated in the twentieth century. Today, the majority of the original wetlands in the US have vanished, transformed into farm fields or buried under city streets.In The Marsh Builders, Sharon Levy delves into the intertwined histories of wetlands loss and water pollution. The book's springboard is the tale of a years-long citizen uprising in Humboldt County, California, which led to the creation of one of the first U.S. wetlands designed to treat city sewage. The book explores the global roots of this local story: the cholera epidemics that plagued nineteenth-century Europe; the researchers who invented modern sewage treatment after bumbling across the insight that microbes break down pollutants in water; the discovery that wetlands act as efficient filters for the pollutants unleashed by modern humanity.More than forty years after the passage of the Clean Water Act launched a nation-wide effort to rescue lakes, rivers and estuaries fouled with human and industrial waste, the need for revived wetlands is more urgent than ever. Waters from Lake Erie and Chesapeake Bay to China's Lake Taihu are tainted with an overload of nutrients carried in runoff from farms and cities, creating underwater dead zones and triggering algal blooms that release toxins into drinking water sources used by millions of people. As the planet warms, scientists are beginning to design wetlands that can shield coastal cities from rising seas. Revived wetlands hold great promise for healing the world's waters.

T1  - Iron and Water:&nbsp;My Life Protecting Minnesota's Environment
AN  - 2148513887
AB  - A memoir of family, mining pioneers and unscrupulous magnates, and the fight for Minnesota's natural resources In 1855 the Merritt family arrived in Minnesota, where a descendant, Alfred, would one day become one of the "Seven Iron Men"--builders of the first mines to tap the state's great mineral wealth in the Mesabi Range. Another Merritt, more than half a century later, would lead the efforts to protect Lake Superior from damage caused by mining. Iron and Water is Grant J. Merritt's memoir of his life's work on behalf of Minnesota's people and environment and also the story of a significant family in state history. Merritt's family played a key role in the struggle over natural resources in Minnesota--for the enrichment of mining pioneers, the prosperity of the state and its people, and the prospect of a secure and healthy future. This complex tale begins with the adventure of discovering iron ore and building the mines, railroads, and docks to move it, then devolves into the intrigues of business partnerships gone bad and attempts by John D. Rockefeller to defraud the Merritts. What follows is an engrossing account of Grant Merritt's years in the halls of state politics and the trenches of environmental activism in defense of Minnesota's North Shore and Lake Superior's waters. The author's tenure as head of the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency under Governor Wendell Anderson and his service on the first board of the Minnesota Environmental Quality Council take us behind the scenes of landmark legal cases and crucial moments in Minnesota history--particularly the notable Reserve Mining case, in which the company was found liable for serious environmental and health threats on the shores of Lake Superior and ordered to be shut down. In these pages we encounter the people who were critical to this history, from robber baron Rockefeller to judges, activists, and politicians, including Walter Mondale and Jim Oberstar. In chronicling both the discovery of vast iron deposits on the Mesabi Range and the fight to save Lake Superior and Minnesota's natural riches, Iron and Water reveals how, whether alone or together, individuals wield the power to change the world.

T1  - A deep learning framework to discern and count microscopic nematode eggs
AN  - 2055597792
AB  - In order to identify and control the menace of destructive pests via microscopic image-based identification state-of-the art deep learning architecture is demonstrated on the parasitic worm, the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines. Soybean yield loss is negatively correlated with the density of SCN eggs that are present in the soil. While there has been progress in automating extraction of egg-filled cysts and eggs from soil samples counting SCN eggs obtained from soil samples using computer vision techniques has proven to be an extremely difficult challenge. Here we show that a deep learning architecture developed for rare object identification in clutter-filled images can identify and count the SCN eggs. The architecture is trained with expert-labeled data to effectively build a machine learning model for quantifying SCN eggs via microscopic image analysis. We show dramatic improvements in the quantification time of eggs while maintaining human-level accuracy and avoiding inter-rater and intra-rater variabilities. The nematode eggs are correctly identified even in complex, debris-filled images that are often difficult for experts to identify quickly. Our results illustrate the remarkable promise of applying deep learning approaches to phenotyping for pest assessment and management.

T1  - Toxic Effects of Bisphenol A, Propyl Paraben, and Triclosan on Caenorhabditis elegans
AN  - 2041104570
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) is a ubiquitous plasticizer which is absorbed by ingestion and dermal contact; propyl paraben (PPB) inhibits the microbiome and extends the shelf life of many personal care products, whereas triclosan (TCS) is commonly found in antiseptics, disinfectants, or additives. In this work, Caenorhabditis elegans was used as a biological model to assess the toxic effects of BPA, PPB, and TCS. The wild type strain, Bristol N2, was used in bioassays with the endpoints of lethality, growth, and reproduction; green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic strains with the hsp-3, hsp-4, hsp-16.2, hsp-70, sod-1, sod-4, cyp-35A4, cyp-29A2, and skn-1 genes were evaluated for their mRNA expression through fluorescence measurement; and quick Oil Red O (q ORO) was utilized to stain lipid deposits. Lethality was concentration-dependent, while TCS and PPB showed more toxicity than BPA. BPA augmented worm length, while PPB reduced it. All toxicants moderately increased the width and the width-length ratio. BPA and PPB promoted reproduction, in contrast to TCS, which diminished it. All toxicants affected the mRNA expression of genes related to cellular stress, control of reactive oxygen species, and nuclear receptor activation. Lipid accumulation occurred in exposed worms. In conclusion, BPA, PPB, and TCS alter the physiology of growth, lipid accumulation, and reproduction in C. elegans, most likely through oxidative stress mechanisms.

T1  - The Art of Naming
AN  - 2134972058
AB  - From 
Tyrannosaurus rex to 
Heteropoda davidbowie: scientific naming as a joyful and creative act. 

Tyrannosaurus rex. 
Homo sapiens. 
Heteropoda davidbowie. Behind each act of scientific naming is a story. In this entertaining and illuminating book, Michael Ohl considers scientific naming as a joyful and creative act. There are about 1.8 million discovered and named plant and animal species, and millions more still to be discovered. Naming is the necessary next step after discovery; it is through the naming of species that we perceive and understand nature. Ohl explains the process, with examples, anecdotes, and a wildly varied cast of characters. He describes the rules for scientific naming; the vernacular isn't adequate. These rules--in standard binomial nomenclature, the generic name followed by specific name--go back to Linnaeus; but they are open to idiosyncrasy and individual expression. A lizard is designated 
Barbaturex morrisoni (in honor of the Doors' Jim Morrison, the Lizard King); a member of the horsefly family 
Scaptia beyonceae. Ohl, a specialist in "winged things that sting," confesses that among the many wasp species he has named is 
Ampulex dementor, after the dementors in the Harry Potter novels. Scientific names have also been deployed by scientists to insult other scientists, to make political statements, and as expressions of romantic love: "I shall name this beetle after my beloved wife." 

The Art of Naming takes us on a surprising and fascinating journey, in the footsteps of the discoverers of species and the authors of names, into the nooks and crannies and drawers and cabinets of museums, and through the natural world of named and not-yet-named species.

T1  - A late Pleistocene gastropod fauna from the northern Caspian Sea with implications for Pontocaspian gastropod taxonomy
AN  - 2170301747
AB  - The present paper details a very diverse non-marine gastropod fauna retrieved from Caspian Pleistocene deposits along the Volga River north of Astrakhan (Russia). During time of deposition (early Late Pleistocene, late Khazarian regional substage), the area was situated in shallow water of the greatly expanded Caspian Sea. The fauna contains 24 species, of which 16 are endemic to the Pontocaspian region and 15 to the Caspian Sea. The majority of the species (13) belongs to the Pyrgulinae ( Hydrobiidae ), a group famous for its huge morphological variability in the Pontocaspian region. The phenotypic diversity has led to an inflation of genus and species names in the literature. New concepts are proposed for many of the genera and species found in the present material, with implications for the systematics and taxonomy of the entire Pontocaspian gastropod fauna.  Laevicaspia vinarskii  sp. n. is described as a new species. This contribution is considered a first step in revising the Pontocaspian gastropod fauna.

T1  - Initial evenness determines diversity and cell density dynamics in synthetic microbial ecosystems
AN  - 1993418748
AB  - The effect of initial evenness on the temporal trajectory of synthetic communities in comprehensive, low-volume microcosm studies remains unknown. We used flow cytometric fingerprinting and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to assess the impact of time on community structure in one hundred synthetic ecosystems of fixed richness but varying initial evenness. Both methodologies uncovered a similar reduction in diversity within synthetic communities of medium and high initial evenness classes. However, the results of amplicon sequencing showed that there were no significant differences between and within the communities in all evenness groups at the end of the experiment. Nevertheless, initial evenness significantly impacted the cell density of the community after five medium transfers. Highly even communities retained the highest cell densities at the end of the experiment. The relative abundances of individual species could be associated to particular evenness groups, suggesting that their presence was dependent on the initial evenness of the synthetic community. Our results reveal that using synthetic communities for testing ecological hypotheses requires prior assessment of initial evenness, as it impacts temporal dynamics.

T1  - Springer Handbook of Petroleum Technology
AN  - 2134084874
AB  - This handbook provides a comprehensive but concise reference resource for the vast field of petroleum technology. Built on the successful book "Practical Advances in Petroleum Processing" published in 2006, it has been extensively revised and expanded to include upstream technologies. The book is divided into four parts: The first part on petroleum characterization offers an in-depth review of the chemical composition and physical properties of petroleum, which determine the possible uses and the quality of the products. The second part provides a brief overview of petroleum geology and upstream practices. The third part exhaustively discusses established and emerging refining technologies from a practical perspective, while the final part describes the production of various refining products, including fuels and lubricants, as well as petrochemicals, such as olefins and polymers. It also covers process automation and real-time refinery-wide process optimization. Two key chapters provide an integrated view of petroleum technology, including environmental and safety issues. 
Written by international experts from academia, industry and research institutions, including integrated oil companies, catalyst suppliers, licensors, and consultants, it is an invaluable resource for researchers and graduate students as well as practitioners and professionals.Comprehensively describes all aspects of petroleum technology, including exploration, transportation and refining of petroleum and natural gas Provides an extensive and comprehensive review of state-of-the-art techniques and technologies used in the industry Offers a reference resource for the oil-refining and petrochemical-production businesses
Dr. Chang Samuel Hsu had over 32 year experience at ExxonMobil and BP before joining in Florida State University six years ago to establish the Future Fuels Institute. He also established the Refinery of the Future Lab at BP. Currently, he is an Adjunct Professor at Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering of Florida A&M University/Florida State University and also at College of Chemical Engineering of China University of Petroleum in Beijing. In 2012, he founded Petro Bio Consulting, LLC. Dr. Hsu was the first researcher to introduce ultrahigh resolution Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) for in-depth molecular characterization of petroleum fractions.  He was one of the pioneers to develop tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) at Exxon to provide an additional dimension for the determination of molecular structure of the components in complex mixtures.  Dr. Hsu's research interest covers petroleum (both upstream and downstream), coal, shale and biomass oils. His current focuses are novel characterization of petroleum biomarkers for exploration and exploitation, and heavy hydrocarbon characterization for hydroprocessing, catalytic cracking, coking and fuels/lubes analyses. He also has extensive experience in environmental damage assessment and remediation for oil spills.  
Dr. Paul Robinson earned BS (Honors) and MA degrees at the University of Missouri at Columbia. He spent a year at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, then moved to the University of California at San Diego, which rewarded him with a PhD in Chemistry. After two years as a Visiting Assistant Professor at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, he began his long career in energy, starting at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where he studied hydrogen energy systems. Subsequently, at the Science and Technology Division of Unocal Corporation, he became involved in catalysis research. He earned several patents, some for commercial catalysts. While working for Unocal, Chevron, and Shell, he was involved in many aspects of refining and most aspects of hydrotreating and hydrocracking. He is most pleased with the work he did in support of online refinery-wide optimization at Suncor Sarnia. During his career in industry, he won several special recognition awards, including two creativity awards and a patent achievement award from Unocal. From 2014 to 2016, he served as Chief Technology Advisor for the VCC process at KBR Inc. In 2016, Paul R. Robinson founded the Katy Institute for Sustainable Energy, a non-profit organization devoted to stimulating science-based dialog on energy.  His credentials include 11 patents, 80 technical publications, a wonderful family, and a black belt in TaeKwonDo.

T1  - Toxicological and biochemical responses of the earthworm Eisenia fetida to cyanobacteria toxins
AN  - 1967044179
AB  - Irrigation with eutrophic water containing cyanobacteria toxins poses a potential risk to soil animals. To evaluate ecotoxicological effect of microcystins (MCs) on earthworms, filter paper acute toxicity test, avoidance test and a 14-d artificial soil test were carried out. No acute toxicity was found in the filter paper test, and earthworms showed no avoidance response to MCs exposure. In the artificial soil test, Eisenia fetida were allowed to grow in presence or absence of MCs (0, 1, 10, 100, 1000 μg kg−1 of soil) for 1, 7, and 14 d. Results showed that MCs could bioaccumulated in earthworm. A stimulatory effect on catalase and glutathione oxidase activities induced by MCs was found on day 1, and both of them were significantly inhibited at 100 and 1000 μg kg−1 on days 14. The superoxide dismutase activity was relatively insensitive. Significant increase of malondialdehyde content and decrease of neutral red retention time were observed at 100 and 1000 μg kg−1 on days 7 and 14. Our results suggest that MCs induces oxidative stress on earthworms, which leads to disruption of the antioxidant system and lipid peroxidation, as well as alterations in lysosomal membrane stability.

T1  - Biofilms in Plant and Soil Health
AN  - 2134754699
AB  - Biofilms are predominant mode of life for microbes under natural conditions. The three-dimensional structure of the biofilm provides enhanced protection from physical, chemical and biological stress conditions to associated microbial communities. These complex and highly structured microbial communities play a vital role in maintaining the health of plants, soils and waters. Biofilm associated with plants may be pathogenic or beneficial based on the nature of their interactions. Pathogenic or undesirable biofilm requires control in many situations, including soil, plants, food and water. 
Written by leading experts from around the world, 
Biofilms in Plant and Soil Health provides an up-to-date review on various aspects of microbial biofilms, and suggests future and emerging trends in biofilms in plant and soil health. 
Issues are addressed in four sub areas: 
 
The fundamentals and significance of biofilm in plant and soil health, and the concept of mono and mixed biofilms by PGPR and fungal biofilms. 
Biochemical and molecular mechanisms in biofilm studies in plant associated bacteria, and techniques in studying biofilms and their characterization, gene expression and enhanced antimicrobial resistance in biofilms, as well as biotic and biotic factors affecting biofilm in vitro. 
The ecological significance of soil associated biofilms and stress management and bioremediation of contaminated soils and degraded ecosystems. 
Pathogenic biofilm associated with plant and food and its control measures. 

  
This book is recommended for students and researchers working in agricultural and environmental microbiology, biotechnology, soil sciences, soil and plant health and plant protection. Researchers working in the area of quorum sensing, biofilm applications, and understanding microbiome of soil and plants will also find it useful.

T1  - Nutritional support of inland aquatic food webs by aged carbon and organic matter
AN  - 2289813413
AB  - Aged (typically tens to thousands of years old) forms of non‐living carbon (C) and organic matter (OM) predominate in many inland water ecosystems. Advances in the methodologies used to measure natural abundance radiocarbon (14C) have led to increased use of natural 14C as both a source and age tracer in aquatic ecosystem and food web studies. Here, we review (1) Δ14C values and ages of C and OM typically found in different inland water systems, (2) the mechanisms through which these materials enter inland water ecosystems, and (3) all available 14C data on aquatic consumers across a range of inland water ecosystem types. Using Δ14C values of aquatic consumers and their potential nutritional resources, we estimate contributions of aged C and OM to aquatic consumer biomass. We conclude that in nearly every case, one or more forms of aged C and/or OM contribute to aquatic consumer nutrition in inland water ecosystems.

T1  - Excretion by Benthic Invertebrates as Important Source of Phosphorus in Oligotrophic Ecosystem (Lake Krivoe, Northern Russia)
TT  - Эκсκреция бентосных беспозвоночных κаκ важный источниκ фосфора в эκосистеме олиготрофного озера
AN  - 2007092704
AB  - We studied contribution of benthic invertebrates to the dissolved phosphates flux from the bottom sediments to the water in an oligotrophic lake (Lake Krivoe, near the White Sea biological station "Kartesh", Northern European Russia) in 2009-2013 with the aim to quantify specific (among and within taxa), spatial (littoral and deep sites) and seasonal variability. The excretion rates (Pexc) of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) were estimated in experiment with dominating taxa of benthic invertebrates (amphipods, oligochaetes, mollusks, and chironomids), freshly collected from the lake. Mass-specific P excretion rate was calculated as Pexc divided by animal dry mass and further used for calculations of benthic P efflux rates. Also, in other experimental series with and without animals (amphipods) we measured extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity. The results showed that the SRP excretion rates varied significantly between taxa and between different-sized individuals within the same taxa (the SRP excretion rate elevates with an increase in individual weight). Notable spatial and seasonal differences in biomass of benthic animals and phosphorus released by them in the lake were found. The calculated phosphorus efflux by excretory activity of benthic animals was more intensive in littoral sites (up to 14.4 nmol m-2d-1 in July), that 7 times greater than maximum efflux in deep areas (2.2 nmol m-2d-1). The mobile burrowing animals (the amphipods Gammarus lacustris, Monoporeia affinis, and Gammaracanthus loricatus) are able to move from the bottom sediments to water and transfer the nutrient; they contributed 80 % of P flux caused by benthic excretion in the lake and affected the activity of the extracellular alkaline phosphatase, increasing its level in water 3-8 times relative to that in the control (without animals). The high phosphatase activity may increase phosphorus bioavailability by catalyzing hydrolysis of organic phosphorus, and further stimulate primary producers.

T1  - Methane fluxes from coastal sediments are enhanced by macrofauna
AN  - 1957857551
AB  - Methane and nitrous oxide are potent greenhouse gases (GHGs) that contribute to climate change. Coastal sediments are important GHG producers, but the contribution of macrofauna (benthic invertebrates larger than 1 mm) inhabiting them is currently unknown. Through a combination of trace gas, isotope, and molecular analyses, we studied the direct and indirect contribution of two macrofaunal groups, polychaetes and bivalves, to methane and nitrous oxide fluxes from coastal sediments. Our results indicate that macrofauna increases benthic methane efflux by a factor of up to eight, potentially accounting for an estimated 9.5% of total emissions from the Baltic Sea. Polychaetes indirectly enhance methane efflux through bioturbation, while bivalves have a direct effect on methane release. Bivalves host archaeal methanogenic symbionts carrying out preferentially hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, as suggested by analysis of methane isotopes. Low temperatures (8 °C) also stimulate production of nitrous oxide, which is consumed by benthic denitrifying bacteria before it reaches the water column. We show that macrofauna contributes to GHG production and that the extent is dependent on lineage. Thus, macrofauna may play an important, but overlooked role in regulating GHG production and exchange in coastal sediment ecosystems.

T1  - Network robustness assessed within a dual connectivity framework: joint dynamics of the Active and Idle Networks
AN  - 1957251907
AB  - Network robustness against attacks has been widely studied in fields as diverse as the Internet, power grids and human societies. But current definition of robustness is only accounting for half of the story: the connectivity of the nodes unaffected by the attack. Here we propose a new framework to assess network robustness, wherein the connectivity of the affected nodes is also taken into consideration, acknowledging that it plays a crucial role in properly evaluating the overall network robustness in terms of its future recovery from the attack. Specifically, we propose a dual perspective approach wherein at any instant in the network evolution under attack, two distinct networks are defined: (i) the Active Network (AN) composed of the unaffected nodes and (ii) the Idle Network (IN) composed of the affected nodes. The proposed robustness metric considers both the efficiency of destroying the AN and that of building-up the IN. We show, via analysis of well-known prototype networks and real world data, that trade-offs between the efficiency of Active and Idle Network dynamics give rise to surprising robustness crossovers and re-rankings, which can have significant implications for decision making.

T1  - The Protection and Conservation of Water Resources
AN  - 2131974707
AB  - This book is about water - in Britain, and in the world. It is about water resources, their conservation, protection of water quality for human consumption and aquatic ecosystems. Since the publication of the first edition in 1998, major political and regulatory changes have taken place; this book provides a clear and comprehensive update of conservation and water resource management issues in the UK over the past two decades, and - in an expansion of its original UK perspective - now includes examples of global best practice. The UK's 2003 adoption of the EU Water Framework Directive has had enormous implications for the conservation and management of our water resources. In 2016, with the UK's decision to leave the EU, the governance scene is entering upon an unpredictable future regarding its major water resource policies. 

The Protection and Conservation of Water Resources, Second Edition, provides a clear and comprehensive update of conservation and water resource management issues. Chapter 1 deals with sustainability and water policy, outlines the issues and challenges, and asks: what is integrated water management? Chapter 2 reviews water availability and sufficiency in Britain, while Chapter 3 explores the dynamic between institutions and legislative framework. Chapter 4 introduces the catchment approach, and Chapters 5 and 6 explore the issues of sustaining bulk supply and the imperatives of climate change. Chapter 7 looks at the contemporary background to water quality issues, and Chapter 8 provides case studies of catchment problems, both urban and rural. Chapter 9 describes solutions in land use change, including technical fixes and their sustainability. Chapter 10 is concerned with emerging governance arrangements, and Chapter 11 takes a global view, looking at successful examples around the world to find positive lessons from Europe, North America and Australia.

T1  - Nanostructures for Antimicrobial Therapy
AN  - 2148416219
AB  - Nanostructures for Antimicrobial Therapy discusses the pros and cons of the use of nanostructured materials in the prevention and eradication of infections, highlighting the efficient microbicidal effect of nanoparticles against antibiotic-resistant pathogens and biofilms. 
Conventional antibiotics are becoming ineffective towards microorganisms due to their widespread and often inappropriate use. As a result, the development of antibiotic resistance in microorganisms is increasingly being reported. New approaches are needed to confront the rising issues related to infectious diseases. The merging of biomaterials, such as chitosan, carrageenan, gelatin, poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) with nanotechnology provides a promising platform for antimicrobial therapy as it provides a controlled way to target cells and induce the desired response without the adverse effects common to many traditional treatments. 
Nanoparticles represent one of the most promising therapeutic treatments to the problem caused by infectious micro-organisms resistant to traditional therapies. This volume discusses this promise in detail, and also discusses what challenges the greater use of nanoparticles might pose to medical professionals. The unique physiochemical properties of nanoparticles, combined with their growth inhibitory capacity against microbes has led to the upsurge in the research on nanoparticles as antimicrobials. The importance of bactericidal nanobiomaterials study will likely increase as development of resistant strains of bacteria against most potent antibiotics continues. 
 
Shows how nanoantibiotics can be used to more effectively treat disease 
Discusses the advantages and issues of a variety of different nanoantibiotics, enabling medics to select which best meets their needs 
Provides a cogent summary of recent developments in this field, allowing readers to quickly familiarize themselves with this topic area

T1  - Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet:&nbsp;Ghosts and Monsters of the Anthropocene
AN  - 2134791634
AB  - Living on a damaged planet challenges who we are and where we live. This timely anthology calls on twenty eminent humanists and scientists to revitalize curiosity, observation, and transdisciplinary conversation about life on earth. As human-induced environmental change threatens multispecies livability, Arts of Living on a Damaged Planet puts forward a bold proposal: entangled histories, situated narratives, and thick descriptions offer urgent "arts of living." Included are essays by scholars in anthropology, ecology, science studies, art, literature, and bioinformatics who posit critical and creative tools for collaborative survival in a more-than-human Anthropocene. The essays are organized around two key figures that also serve as the publication's two openings: Ghosts, or landscapes haunted by the violences of modernity; and Monsters, or interspecies and intraspecies sociality. Ghosts and Monsters are tentacular, windy, and arboreal arts that invite readers to encounter ants, lichen, rocks, electrons, flying foxes, salmon, chestnut trees, mud volcanoes, border zones, graves, radioactive waste--in short, the wonders and terrors of an unintended epoch.

T1  - Petrogenic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Aquatic Environment: Analysis, Synthesis, Toxicity and Environmental Impact
AN  - 2148389838
AB  - Although a lot is known about the influence of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) on the marine environment, there are still many unanswered questions. Petrogenic Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in the Aquatic Environment is a monograph that sums up basic knowledge about this topic while highlighting current research practices useful in studying the aquatic environment. It starts with an introduction to effect of PAH in the marine environment. It then proceeds to provide information on techniques to monitor PAH levels and investigate the affected environment in order to control the subsequent negative effects. Chapters also detail the carcinogenic and endocrine effects of PAHs on fish as well as the degradation of PAHs by microorganisms. This monograph is a useful reference for environmental science students and professionals learning about the role of PAH in the marine environment.

T1  - Intracellular lipid binding protein family diversity from Oyster Crassostrea gigas: genomic and structural features of invertebrate lipid transporters
AN  - 1903453471
AB  - Intracellular lipid binding proteins (iLBPs) play a role in the transport and cellular uptake of fatty acids and gene expression regulation. The aim of this work was to characterize the iLBP gene family of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, one of the most cultivated marine bivalves in the world, using bioinformatics and molecular biology approaches. A total of 26 different iLBPs transcripts were identified in the Pacific oyster genome, including alternative splicing and gene duplication events. The oyster iLBP gene family seems to be more expanded than in other invertebrates. Furthermore, 3D structural modeling and molecular docking analysis mapped the main amino acids involved in ligand interactions, and comparisons to available protein structures from vertebrate families revealed new binding cavities. Ten different CgiLBPs were analyzed by quantitative PCR in various tissues of C. gigas, which suggested differential prevalent gene expression of CgiLBPs among tissue groups. The data indicate a wider repertoire of iLBPs in labial palps, a food-sorting tissue. The different gene transcription profiles and reported docking systems suggest that the iLBPs are a non-generalist ligand binding protein family with specific functions.

T1  - Life strategy and grazing intensity responses of Brachionus calyciflorus fed on different concentrations of microcystin-producing and microcystin-free Microcystis aeruginosa
AN  - 1901720831
AB  - The occurrence of Microcystis blooms is a worldwide concern due to the numerous adverse effects on zooplankton. We therefore hypothesized that the cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa is harmful to rotifer growth. Population and individual experiments were conducted with the same proportional volumes of Chlorella and Microcystis for given food densities. Life-table parameters, life-history traits, and the grazing intensity of Brachionus calyciflorus were evaluated after they had fed on microcystin-producing and microcystin-free Microcystis, both alone and combined with an edible alga (Chlorella pyrenoidosa), at concentrations of 1 × 105 , 1 × 106 , and 1 × 107 cells mL-1 . The results showed that the interactive effects of food density and type appeared to be synergistic on generation time (T), net reproduction rate (R0 ), body length, swimming speed, and reproduction time. In contrast, these effects appeared to be antagonistic on intrinsic growth rate (r), finite rate of increase (λ), time to first brood, post-reproductive time and total offspring per female. The grazing rate of rotifers decreased with grazing time. Although the toxins released after grazing on M. aeruginosa had negative effects on rotifer growth and reproduction, B. calyciflorus changed its life strategy and grazing intensity in response to eutrophic conditions.

T1  - De novo transcriptome analysis and microsatellite marker development for population genetic study of a serious insect pest, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae)
AN  - 1869532679
AB  - The bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), is one of the most abundant aphid pests of cereals and has a global distribution. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a rapid and efficient method for developing molecular markers. However, transcriptomic and genomic resources of R. padi have not been investigated. In this study, we used transcriptome information obtained by RNA-Seq to develop polymorphic microsatellites for investigating population genetics in this species. The transcriptome of R. padi was sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. A total of 114.4 million raw reads with a GC content of 40.03% was generated. The raw reads were cleaned and assembled into 29,467 unigenes with an N50 length of 1,580 bp. Using several public databases, 82.47% of these unigenes were annotated. Of the annotated unigenes, 8,022 were assigned to COG pathways, 9,895 were assigned to GO pathways, and 14,586 were mapped to 257 KEGG pathways. A total of 7,936 potential microsatellites were identified in 5,564 unigenes, 60 of which were selected randomly and amplified using specific primer pairs. Fourteen loci were found to be polymorphic in the four R. padi populations. The transcriptomic data presented herein will facilitate gene discovery, gene analyses, and development of molecular markers for future studies of R. padi and other closely related aphid species.

T1  - Comparative Analysis between Ecotoxicity of Nitrogen-, Phosphorus-, and Potassium-Based Fertilizers and Their Active Ingredients
AN  - 1889004134
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the ecotoxicity of nitrogen-, phosphorus-, and potassium-based compounds to organisms of two different trophic levels in order to compare the toxic effect between high-purity substances and these substances as components of fertilizers. Dilutions were made with the fertilizers’ potassium chloride, potassium nitrate, superphosphate, urea, and their equivalent reagents, to conduct assays to establish the acute lethal concentration for half of the population (LC50). Ten individuals of the benthic snail Biomphalaria glabrata and the fish Danio rerio were exposed to each concentration of tested compounds. As a result, the toxicity levels of potassium chloride, potassium nitrate, and urea were obtained for B. glabrata and D. rerio, with the fish being more susceptible to potassium chloride in the fertilizer and the snail to potassium nitrate and urea, in both commercial and reagent forms. Regarding superphosphate, no significant toxicity was found. This study concluded that among the tested substances, KNO3 and KCl were the most toxic substances and urea the least toxic. It was not possible to establish the most sensitive species since, for KCl, the fish were more susceptible to the fertilizer and the snail to the reagent, while for KNO3 the opposite was observed.

T1  - Water implications in Mediterranean irrigation networks: Problems and solutions
AN  - 1865197261
AB  - Agriculture is a significant user of water and energy in Mediterranean coasts of Europe, such as Spanish Mediterranean regions. Water implications of such irrigations are well known but there are many problems that must be taken into account when designing each phase of the irrigation system, not only in the construction phase but in the exploitation, control and maintenance of all the elements in the network. All the possible problems in each part of the irrigation system will be analyzed in the following paper, proposing several solutions to avoid these problems or mitigate its consequences. These solutions go from the simple maintenance of pipes and valeus to the implementation of more sophisticated systems, such as SCADA, or management strategies, such as benchmarking.

T1  - Effects of Antifouling Biocides on Molecular and Biochemical Defense System in the Gill of the Pacific Oyster Crassostrea gigas
AN  - 1851682700
AB  - Antifouling biocides such as organotin compounds and their alternatives are potent toxicants in marine ecosystems. In this study, we employed several molecular and biochemical response systems of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas to understand a potential mode of action of antifouling biocides (i.e. tributyltin (TBT), diuron and irgarol) after exposure to different concentrations (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg L-1) for 96 h. As a result, all the three antifouling biocides strongly induced the antioxidant defense system. TBT reduced both enzymatic activity and mRNA expression of Na+/K+-ATPase and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Lower levels of both Na+/K+-ATPase activity and AChE mRNA expression were observed in the diuron-exposed oysters compared to the control, while the irgarol treatment reduced only the transcriptional expression of AChE gene. We also analyzed transcript profile of heat shock protein (Hsp) superfamily in same experimental conditions. All antifouling biocides tested in this study significantly modulated mRNA expression of Hsp superfamily with strong induction of Hsp70 family. Taken together, overall results indicate that representative organotin TBT and alternatives have potential hazardous effects on the gill of C. gigas within relatively short time period. Our results also suggest that analyzing a series of molecular and biochemical parameters can be a way of understanding and uncovering the mode of action of emerging antifouling biocides. In particular, it was revealed that Pacific oysters have different sensitivities depend on the antifouling biocides.

T1  - Angling for success: How to defend your favourite hobby from invasive species
AN  - 1803017514
AB  - Invasive species commonly hitch rides on boats, trailers, boating and fishing equipment, including bait buckets. Impacts from aquatic invasive species are broad and can include; reducing the number of native fish, and causing problems for native mussels (many of which are at risk). They can also damage the natural beauty of our lakes and waterways.

              
You can report sightings of invasive species by calling the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters' Invading Species Hotline at 1-800-563-7711 or by emailing info@invadingspecies.com. You can also use the EDDMapS Ontario system to report sightings through your computer or smartphone.

T1  - Cheats and Deceits:&nbsp;How Animals and Plants Exploit and Mislead
AN  - 2134797685
AB  - In nature, trickery and deception are widespread. Animals and plants mimic other objects or species in the environment for protection, trick other species into rearing their young, lure prey to their death, and deceive potential mates for reproduction. Cuckoos lay eggs carefully matched to their host's own clutch. Harmless butterflies mimic the wing patterning of a poisonous butterfly to avoid being eaten. The deep-sea angler fish hangs a glowing, fleshy lure infront of its mouth to draw the attention of potential prey, while some male fish alter their appearance to look like females in order to sneak past rivals in mating. Some orchids develop the smell of female insects in order to attract pollinators, while carnivorous plants lure insects to their death withcolourful displays.In this book, Martin Stevens describes the remarkable range of such adaptations in nature, and considers how they have evolved, and become increasingly perfected as part of an arms race between predator and prey or host and parasite. He explores the work of naturalists and biologists from Alfred Russel Wallace to current research, showing how scientists find ways of testing the impact of particular behaviours and colourings on the animals it is meant to fool, as opposed to our humanperceptions. Drawing on a wide range of examples, Stevens considers what deception tells us about the process of evolution and adaptation.

T1  - When Parasites Are Good for Health: Cestode Parasitism Increases Resistance to Arsenic in Brine Shrimps
AN  - 1777280156
AB  - Parasites and pollutants can both affect any living organism, and their interactions can be very important. To date, repeated studies have found that parasites and heavy metals or metalloids both have important negative effects on the health of animals, often in a synergistic manner. Here, we show for the first time that parasites can increase host resistance to metalloid arsenic, focusing on a clonal population of brine shrimp from the contaminated Odiel and Tinto estuary in SW Spain. We studied the effect of cestodes on the response of Artemia to arsenic (acute toxicity tests, 24h LC50) and found that infection consistently reduced mortality across a range of arsenic concentrations. An increase from 25°C to 29°C, simulating the change in mean temperature expected under climate change, increased arsenic toxicity, but the benefits of infection persisted. Infected individuals showed higher levels of catalase and glutathione reductase activity, antioxidant enzymes with a very important role in the protection against oxidative stress. Levels of TBARS were unaffected by parasites, suggesting that infection is not associated with oxidative damage. Moreover, infected Artemia had a higher number of carotenoid-rich lipid droplets which may also protect the host through the "survival of the fattest" principle and the antioxidant potential of carotenoids. This study illustrates the need to consider the multi-stress context (contaminants and temperature increase) in which host-parasite interactions occur.

T1  - Probability of acoustic transmitter detections by receiver lines in Lake Huron: results of multi-year field tests and simulations
AN  - 1846012320
AB  - Background

              
Advances in acoustic telemetry technology have led to an improved understanding of the spatial ecology of many freshwater and marine fish species. Understanding the performance of acoustic receivers is necessary to distinguish between tagged fish that may have been present but not detected and from those fish that were absent from the area. In this study, two stationary acoustic transmitters were deployed 250 m apart within each of four acoustic receiver lines each containing at least 10 receivers (i.e., eight acoustic transmitters) located in Saginaw Bay and central Lake Huron for nearly 2 years to determine whether the probability of detecting an acoustic transmission varied as a function of time (i.e., season), location, and distance between acoustic transmitter and receiver. Distances between acoustic transmitters and receivers ranged from 200 m to >10 km in each line. The daily observed probability of detecting an acoustic transmission was used in simulation models to estimate the probability of detecting a moving acoustic transmitter on a line of receivers.

              
Results

              
The probability of detecting an acoustic transmitter on a receiver 1000 m away differed by month for different receiver lines in Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay but was similar for paired acoustic transmitters deployed 250 m apart within the same line. Mean probability of detecting an acoustic transmitter at 1000 m calculated over the study period varied among acoustic transmitters 250 m apart within a line and differed among receiver lines in Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay. The simulated probability of detecting a moving acoustic transmitter on a receiver line was characterized by short periods of time with decreased detection. Although increased receiver spacing and higher fish movement rates decreased simulated detection probability, the location of the simulated receiver line in Lake Huron had the strongest effect on simulated detection probability.

              
Conclusions

              
Performance of receiver lines in Lake Huron varied across a range of spatiotemporal scales and was inconsistent among receiver lines. Our simulations indicated that if 69 kHz acoustic transmitters operating at 158 dB in 10-30 m of freshwater were being used, then receivers should be placed 1000 m apart to ensure that all fish moving at 1 m s-1 or less will be detected 90% of days over a 2-year period. Whereas these results can be used as general guidelines for designing new studies, the irregular variation in acoustic transmitter detection probabilities we observed among receiver line locations in Lake Huron makes designing receiver lines in similar systems challenging and emphasizes the need to conduct post hoc analyses of acoustic transmitter detection probabilities.

T1  - Plasticity varies with boldness in a weakly-electric fish
AN  - 1800759750
AB  - Background               The expression of animal personality is indicated by patterns of consistency in individual behaviour. Often, the differences exhibited between individuals are consistent across situations. However, between some situations, this can be biased by variable levels of individual plasticity. The interaction between individual plasticity and animal personality can be illustrated by examining situation-sensitive personality traits such as boldness (i.e. risk-taking and exploration tendency). For the weakly electric fish Gnathonemus petersii, light condition is a major factor influencing behaviour. Adapted to navigate in low-light conditions, this species chooses to be more active in dark environments where risk from visual predators is lower. However, G. petersii also exhibit individual differences in their degree of behavioural change from light to dark. The present study, therefore, aims to examine if an increase of motivation to explore in the safety of the dark, not only affects mean levels of boldness, but also the variation between individuals, as a result of differences in individual plasticity.               Results               Boldness was consistent between a novel-object and a novel-environment situation in bright light. However, no consistency in boldness was noted between a bright (risky) and a dark (safe) novel environment. Furthermore, there was a negative association between boldness and the degree of change across novel environments, with shier individuals exhibiting greater behavioural plasticity.               Conclusions               This study highlights that individual plasticity can vary with personality. In addition, the effect of light suggests that variation in boldness is situation specific. Finally, there appears to be a trade-off between personality and individual plasticity with shy but plastic individuals minimizing costs when perceiving risk and bold but stable individuals consistently maximizing rewards, which can be maladaptive.

T1  - Using Self-Organizing Neural Network Map Combined with Ward's Clustering Algorithm for Visualization of Students' Cognitive Structural Models about Aliveness Concept
AN  - 1755484522
AB  - We propose an approach to clustering and visualization of students' cognitive structural models. We use the self-organizing map (SOM) combined with Ward's clustering to conduct cluster analysis. In the study carried out on 100 subjects, a conceptual understanding test consisting of open-ended questions was used as a data collection tool. The results of analyses indicated that students constructed the aliveness concept by associating it predominantly with human. Motion appeared as the most frequently associated term with the aliveness concept. The results suggest that the aliveness concept has been constructed using anthropocentric and animistic cognitive structures. In the next step, we used the data obtained from the conceptual understanding test for training the SOM. Consequently, we propose a visualization method about cognitive structure of the aliveness concept.

T1  - Mottled Mice and Non-Mammalian Models of Menkes Disease
AN  - 2308656753
AB  - Menkes disease is a multi-systemic copper metabolism disorder caused by mutations in the X-linked ATP7A gene and characterised by progressive neurodegeneration and severe connective tissue defects. The ATP7A protein is a Copper (Cu)-transporting ATPase expressed in all tissues and plays a critical role in the maintenance of copper homeostasis in cells of the whole body. ATP7A participates in copper absorption in the small intestine and in copper transport to the CNS across the blood-brain-barrier and blood–cerebrospinal fluid- barrier. Cu is essential for synaptogenesis and axonal development. In cells, ATP7A participates in the incorporation of copper into Cu-dependent enzymes during the course of its maturation in the secretory pathway. There is a high degree of homology (>80% ) between the human ATP7A and murine Atp7a genes. Mice with mutations in the Atp7a gene, called mottled mutants, are well-established and excellent models of Menkes disease. Mottled mutants closely recapitulate the Menkes phenotype and are invaluable for studying Cu-metabolism. They provide useful models for exploring and testing new forms of therapy in Menkes disease. Recently, non-mammalian models of Menkes disease, Drosophila melanogaster and Danio rerio mutants were used in experiments which would be technically difficult to carry out in mammals.

T1  - Coalescent Modelling Suggests Recent Secondary-Contact of Cryptic Penguin Species
AN  - 1748873388
AB  - Molecular genetic analyses present powerful tools for elucidating demographic and biogeographic histories of taxa. Here we present genetic evidence showing a dynamic history for two cryptic lineages within Eudyptula, the world's smallest penguin. Specifically, we use a suite of genetic markers to reveal that two congeneric taxa ('Australia' and 'New Zealand') co-occur in southern New Zealand, with only low levels of hybridization. Coalescent modelling suggests that the Australian little penguin only recently expanded into southern New Zealand. Analyses conducted under time-dependent molecular evolutionary rates lend support to the hypothesis of recent anthropogenic turnover, consistent with shifts detected in several other New Zealand coastal vertebrate taxa. This apparent turnover event highlights the dynamic nature of the region’s coastal ecosystem.

"They've made many good recommendations. We're going to review them all and move on them."              "Our thinking is some time between now and 2020, when they're going to apply for a licence, they can start the assessment and have it complete so it can come to the Clean Environment Commission around '22 or '23," [Terry Sargeant] said.              "Lake Erie was in much more dire straits than Lake Winnipeg, and it's come back. It's still ecologically impaired, but provides habitat for wildlife and ecological services to people," he said. "Nobody's throwing their hands up and saying, 'We give up, this lake is gone.' "

T1  - The Real Thing:&nbsp;The Natural History of Ian McTaggart Cowan
AN  - 2148496078
AB  - The Real Thing is the first official biography of Ian McTaggart Cowan (1910-2010), the "father of Canadian ecology." Authorized by his family and with the research support and participation of the University of Victoria Libraries, Briony Penn provides an unprecedented and accessible window into the story of this remarkable naturalist. From his formative years roaming the mountains around Vancouver looking for venison to his last years finishing the voluminous and authoritative Birds of British Columbia, Cowan's life provides a unique perspective on a century of environmental change--with a critical message for the future. As the head and founder of the first university-based wildlife department in Canada, Ian McTaggart Cowan revolutionized the way North Americans understood the natural world, and students flocked into his classrooms to hear his brilliant, entertaining lectures regarding the new science of ecology. During his academic career, Ian McTaggart Cowan stepped outside the narrow confines of academia to pioneer nature television. His television programs in the 1950s and '60s, Fur and Feathers, The Web of Life and The Living Sea, made him a household name around the world by capturing the first microscopic organisms on TV and bringing a live moose into the studio. He was also responsible for hiring a young David Suzuki, who followed in his nature-show-host footsteps. Cowan's early work in the national parks became the foundation for wildlife conservation and environmental education in Canada. And like his US counterpart and colleague Aldo Leopold, he was part of a secret fraternity that practised a reverence for wildness and influenced three generations of scientists and politicians on everything from conservation of endangered species to the dangers of pesticides and climate change, long before these topics were generally acknowledged. In his 80s he was still pioneering new ways to communicate nature through ecotourism, and well into his 90s he was still mentoring young ecologists. Cowan's last publication at age 91 was the final volume of Birds of British Columbia, which the Royal BC Museum called "one of the biggest publishing events in Canadian history." Illustrated throughout with colour and black-and-white photos from all aspects of Cowan's life, The Real Thing takes the reader on an adventurous and inspirational journey through the heart of North American ecology, wilderness, landscape and wonder.

T1  - The benthic regeneration of N and P in the Great Brak estuary, South Africa
AN  - 1734300626
AB  - The Great Brak is a temporarily open/closed estuary (TOCE) located on the south coast of South Africa. The construction of the Wolwedans Dam in 1989 reduced baseflow to the estuary by 56%, decreasing the intensity of flushing events and causing t he mouth to breach less often. The aim of t his study was to investigate the flux of inorganic nutrients (NH^sup +^^sub 4^, TOxN [NO^sup -^^sub 3^ + NO^sup -^^sub 2^], SRP) as well as total N and P across the sediment-water interface in the estuary. There have been very few studies on nutrient cycling and benthic pelagic coupling in South African estuaries. This study showed t hat t he sediment had a net efflux of NH^sup +^^sub 4^, SRP, TN and TP while TOx N was taken up or converted to other forms of N. The estuary acted as a source of N and P during both summer and w inter. If the estuary remains closed for a prolonged period (12 months), with an increased organic load present on the bent hos, the associated rates of efflux of N and P would increase. In order to reduce the organic load to the system better flushing met hods or, more importantly, a n increase in base flow, is needed to reduce residence times of water in the estuary.

T1  - Activity and Transcriptional Responses of Hepatopancreatic Biotransformation and Antioxidant Enzymes in the Oriental River Prawn Macrobrachium nipponense Exposed to Microcystin-LR
AN  - 1732945754
AB  - Microcystins (MCs) are a major group of cyanotoxins with side effects in many organisms; thus, compounds in this group are recognized as potent stressors and health hazards in aquatic ecosystems. In order to assess the toxicity of MCs and detoxification mechanism of freshwater shrimp Macrobrachium nipponense, the full-length cDNAs of the glutathione S-transferase (gst) and catalase (cat) genes were isolated from the hepatopancreas. The transcription level and activity changes in the biotransformation enzyme (glutathione S-transferase (GST)) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx)) in the hepatopancreas of M. nipponense exposed to MC-LR (0.2, 1, 5, and 25 μg/L) for 12, 24, 72 and 96 h were analyzed. The results showed that the isolated full-length cDNAs of cat and gst genes from M. nipponense displayed a high similarity to other crustaceans, and their mRNAs were mainly expressed in the hepatopancreas. MC-LR caused significant increase of GST activity following 48-96 h (p < 0.05) and an increase in SOD activity especially in 24- and 48-h exposures. CAT activity was activated when exposed to MC-LR in 12-, 24- and 48-h exposures and then it was inhibited at 96-h exposure. There was no significant effect on GPx activity after the 12- and 24-h exposures, whereas it was significantly stimulated after the 72- and 96-h exposures (p < 0.05). The transcription was altered similarly to enzyme activity, but the transcriptional response was generally more immediate and had greater amplitude than enzymatic response, particularly for GST. All of the results suggested that MC-LR can induce antioxidative modulation variations in M. nipponense hepatopancreas in order to eliminate oxidative damage.

T1  - Probiotics and Prebiotics:&nbsp;Current Research and Future Trends
AN  - 2295244059
AB  - Composed of nearly a thousand different types of micro-organisms, some beneficial, others not, the human gut microbiota plays an important role in health and disease. This is due to the presence of probiotic or beneficial microbes, or due to the feeding of prebiotics that stimulate the endogenous beneficial microbes: these promote health by stimulating the immune system, improving the digestion and absorption of nutrients, and inhibiting the growth of pathogens. The notable health benefits of probiotic organisms have stimulated much commercial interest, which in turn has led to a plethora of research initiatives in this area; these range from studies to elucidate the efficacy of the various health benefits to analyses of the diet-microbe interaction as a means of modulating the gut microbiota composition. Research in this area is at a very exciting stage. With state-of-the-art commentaries on all aspects of probiotics and prebiotics research, this book provides an authoritative and timely overview of the field. Written by leading international researchers, each chapter affords a critical insight to a particular topic, reviews current research, discusses future direction and aims to stimulate discussion. Topics range from the different microorganisms used as probiotics (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, yeast, etc) and techniques and approaches used (metagenomics, etc) to the reviews of the clinical and medical aspects. The provision of extensive reference sections positively encourages readers to pursue each subject in greater detail. Containing 33 chapters, the book is an invaluable source of information and essential reading for everyone working with probiotics, prebiotics and the gut microbiota, from the PhD student to the experienced scientist, in academia, the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries and working in clinical environments.

T1  - Vertical Reefs:&nbsp;Life on Oil and Gas Platforms in the Gulf of Mexico
AN  - 2131239869
AB  - On a clear night, the bright lights of oil platforms sparkle in the Gulf of Mexico. Thousands of these platforms off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana play an important role in the lives of underwater species who find food, shelter, and permanent homes in the ecosystem created by these big, three-dimensional structures standing on the flat sea floor. They may also play lesser-known roles “above the waves” in the migration of birds and even insects. Tapping into years of diving experience, marine biologist Mary Wicksten looks at the inhabitants and visitors of these “vertical reefs”, explaining how life arrives on the platforms, what species settle and stay (like barnacles), and which ones visit then disappear (like silky sharks). She looks at how different life forms take up occupancy from the surface downward, and she shows how these communities vary on nearshore and deepwater platforms. While most people may never experience the undersea world of oil platforms, this book will bring a better understanding of it to any teacher, beachgoer, angler, diver, or coastal resident who ever wondered what was going on beneath those far-off lights.

T1  - Evaluating Effects of Poultry Waste Application on Phosphorus Loads to Lake Tenkiller
AN  - 1729212688
AB  - Lake Tenkiller located in Oklahoma, USA is a large midcontinent reservoir in a eutrophic state due to excess phosphorus (P) loads. Poultry waste application within the Illinois River Watershed in northeast Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas has been identified as a major contributor to overall P loads within Lake Tenkiller. In this study, Groundwater Loading Effects of Agricultural Management Systems (GLEAMS) was applied to evaluate the effect of poultry waste application on P loads to Lake Tenkiller. Historical P loads to Lake Tenkiller during 1951-2000 have increased from approximately 166,000 kg/year to more than 295,000 kg/year with the Illinois River at Tahlequah subwatershed increasing from 68% to 78% of total P loads over that period. Increased poultry waste application based on poultry growth rates could increase P load to Lake Tenkiller from 311,000 kg/year to more than 528,000 kg/year. Cessation of poultry waste application and addition of buffers along streams could reduce P loads to approximately 92,000 kg/year for cessation of poultry waste application alone and about 89,000 kg/year for cessation of poultry waste application with buffers. One possible strategy to reduce P load to Lake Tenkiller is to cease applying poultry waste application, especially in the portion of the Illinois River above the Tahlequah USGS gage station.

T1  - The Toledo Drinking Water Advisory: Suggested Application of the Water Safety Planning Approach
AN  - 1729212684
AB  - On 2 August 2014 the city of Toledo, in Ohio USA issued a "do not drink" water advisory and declared a state of emergency. This was as a result of elevated levels of the toxin microcystin in the final treated water, a dangerous toxin produced by the algae cyanobacteria. The Toledo water crisis is a key focusing event that can advance dialogue on eutrophication governance in the context of public health. This paper examines the Toledo water ban with the aim of determining whether this crisis could have been averted. Further, we explore how this event can be used to stimulate action on eutrophication governance, to motivate action to protect water at its source. We use the World Health Organization's Water Safety Planning Methodology to show that the crisis could have been averted with some simple risk management actions. We also show that a water safety planning approach could lead to well developed operational and maintenance planning resulting in a higher probability of safe drinking water.

T1  - Short winters threaten temperate fish populations
AN  - 1696232182
AB  - Although climate warming is expected to benefit temperate ectotherms by lengthening the summer growing season, declines in reproductive success following short, warm winters may counter such positive effects. Here we present long-term (1973-2010) field patterns for Lake Erie yellow perch, Perca flavescens, which show that failed annual recruitment events followed short, warm winters. Subsequent laboratory experimentation and field investigations revealed how reduced reproductive success following short, warm winters underlie these observed field patterns. Following short winters, females spawn at warmer temperatures and produce smaller eggs that both hatch at lower rates and produce smaller larvae than females exposed to long winters. Our research suggests that continued climate warming can lead to unanticipated, negative effects on temperate fish populations.

AN  - 1691227470
AB  - Invasive species pose a growing threat to Ontario's biodiversity and cause millions of dollars in damage annually. There are more invasive species in Ontario than anywhere else in Canada, so it is a good thing that the Invading Species Awareness Program (ISAP) Hit Squad is working across the province again this summer to spread awareness about the impacts that invasive species are having on our environment, economy, and society. One member of the squad is located here in Lanark this summer.

T1  - Toward a Unified Ecology
AN  - 2131414355
AB  - The first edition of Toward a Unified Ecology was ahead of its time. For the second edition, the authors present a new synthesis of their core ideas on evaluating communities, organisms, populations, biomes, models, and management. The book now places greater emphasis on post-normal critiques, cognizant of ever-present observer values in the system. The problem it addresses is how to work holistically on complex things that cannot be defined, and this book continues to build an approach to the problem of scaling in ecosystems. Provoked by complexity theory, the authors add a whole new chapter on the central role of narrative in science and how models improve them. The book takes data and modeling seriously, with a sophisticated philosophy of science.

T1  - Cellular Energy Allocation to Assess the Impact of Nanomaterials on Soil Invertebrates (Enchytraeids): The Effect of Cu and Ag
AN  - 1695239263
AB  - The effects of several copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) nanomaterials were assessed using the cellular energy allocation (CEA), a methodology used to evaluate the energetic status and which relates with organisms' overall condition and response to toxic stress. Enchytraeus crypticus (Oligochatea), was exposed to the reproduction effect concentrations EC20/50 of several Cu and Ag materials (CuNO3, Cu-Field, Cu-Nwires and Cu-NPs; AgNO3, Ag NM300K, Ag-NPs Non-coated and Ag-NPs PVP-coated) for 7 days (0-3-7d). The parameters measured were the total energy reserves available (protein, carbohydrate and lipid budgets) and the energy consumption (Ec) integrated to obtain the CEA. Results showed that these parameters allowed a clear discrimination between Cu and Ag, but less clearly within each of the various materials. For Cu there was an increase in Ec and protein budget, while for Ag a decrease was observed. The results corroborate known mechanisms, e.g., with Cu causing an increase in metabolic rate whereas Ag induces mitochondrial damage. The various Cu forms seem to activate different mechanisms with size and shape (e.g., Cu-NPs versus Cu-Nwires), causing clearly different effects. For Ag, results are in line with a slower oxidation rate of Ag-NMs in comparison with Ag-salt and hence delayed effects.

T1  - Phycotoxins:&nbsp;Chemistry and Biochemistry
AN  - 2130941191
AB  - Phycotoxins are a diverse group of poisonous substances produced by certain seaweed and algae in marine and fresh waters. They are important to the scientific community for many reasons, the most obvious being that they pose food safety issues, and regularly monitoring the presence of these compounds in foods requires a large investment. 

Phycotoxins: Chemistry and Biochemistry, second edition presents the most updated information available on phycotoxins. Major emphases are given to chemistry and biochemistry, and origins, mechanisms of action, toxicology and analytical methodology are also covered. 
Since the publication of the first edition, there have been major advances in the science of marine and aquatic toxins, as well as advances in toxicology, analytical chemistry and pharmacology. This fully revised and updated edition includes several new chapters, including those on ciguatoxins, pinnatoxin and ichthyotoxins, as well as new chapters on food safety control of marine toxins, climate change and water toxins, and microalgae as a source of nutraceuticals. 
The book will be of interest to toxicologists, marine, food and plant scientists, as well as researchers and academics in the areas of food science, medicine, public health, toxicology, pharmacology and marine biology.

T1  - Tools for Critical Thinking in Biology
AN  - 2141122325
AB  - The American Association for the Advancement of Science's report on Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education suggests that instructors "can no longer rely solely on trying to cover a syllabus packed with topics" but rather should "introduce fewer concepts but present them in greater depth." They further suggest that the principles embodied in a set of core concepts and competencies should be the basis for all undergraduate biology courses, including those designed for nonmajors.The theme of Tools for Critical Thinking in Biology will be the first and most fundamental of these competencies: the ability to apply the process of science. Biology courses and curricula must engage students in how scientific inquiry is conducted, including evaluating and interpreting scientific explanations of the natural world. The book uses diverse examples to illustrate how experiments work, how hypotheses can be tested by systematic and comparative observations when experiments aren't possible, how models are useful in science, and how sound decisions can be based on the weight of evidence even when uncertainty remains. These are fundamental issues in the process of science that are important for everyone to understand, whether they pursue careers in science or not. Where other introductory biology textbooks are organized by scientific concepts, Tools for Critical Thinking in Biology will instead show how methods can be used to test hypotheses in fields as different as ecology and medicine, using contemporary case studies. The book will provide students with a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of such methods for answering new questions, and will thereby change the way they think about the fundamentals of biology.

T1  - Oakville divers are making a splash to look for trash
AN  - 1675116005
AB  - "I am overwhelmed at the amount of debris I see above and below the water and on the shorelines.  Many of us in North America are blessed to have drinkable tap water, unlike many other countries whose water resources are saturated with toxins," he said. "We need to educate our population today on the actions we must take to preserve our water resources for future generations."

              
"It's used by thousands of people in the summer. We find bottles and we can clean that up so kids don't cut their feet. If everybody does a little bit, it makes a big difference. If nobody does anything, then nothing ever gets done," [Robert Shannon] said..

              
"Zebra mussels have absorbed so much of the phosphate, you can use phosphate soap now because it will actually help the lake. Before the fresh, green-looking fresh water from Lake Ontario, it was brown, so people automatically thought it was toxic pollution. But it wasn't," said Shannon.

T1  - Knobil and Neill's Physiology of Reproduction
AN  - 2141101827
AB  - The Fourth Edition of Knobil & Neill continues to serve as a reference aid for research, to provide the historical context to current research, and most importantly as an aid for graduate teaching on a broad range of topics in human and comparative reproduction. In the decade since the publication of the last edition, the study of reproductive physiology has undergone monumental changes. Chief among these advances are in the areas of stem cell development, signaling pathways, the role of inflammation in the regulatory processes in the various tissues, and the integration of new animal models which have led to a greater understanding of human disease. The new edition synthesizes all of this new information at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels of organization and present modern physiology a more understandable and comparative context. 
The Fourth Edition has been extensively revised, reflecting new fundamental advancements in this rapidly advancing field.Provides a common language for researchers across the fields of physiology, endocrinology, and biology to discuss their understanding of reproduction.Saves academic researchers time in quickly accessing the very latest details on reproductive physiology, as opposed to searching through thousands of journal articles.

T1  - Compendium of Sensors and Monitors and Their Use in the Global Water Industry
AN  - 2134592721
AB  - Online monitoring of water quality is an powerful enabler in the water industry. It is a crucial component in the pro-active management of processes and assets, and helps improve performance and cost efficiency. Instrumentation for the monitoring of most water quality parameters is commercially available. Implementation of such equipment, however, remains largely limited to a small number of basic parameters and is still confined to key nodes in collection, treatment and distribution systems. A primary hurdle to further realization of the potential of online monitoring is the lack of publicly available information on system performance, key drivers and barriers (technical, economic and social) to successful implementation. A study was performed to identify and document information on commercially available instrument types, associated costs (capital and operating), and real-world experiences with the use of sensors in the global water / wastewater industry. This information was compiled in an online compendium, to facilitate sharing of information and learning from experience. The study has shown that the current generation of technology is suitable for routine operation. However, there is no one-size-fits-all solution to monitoring questions. Furthermore, successful application of on-line water quality monitoring requires commitment of considerable resources, which need to be accompanied by a solid QA/QC plan. Furthermore, the understanding and appreciation of monitoring and the efforts required to make it a success need to be embedded and supported at all levels within an organization. Deciding whether on-line monitoring is the best solution to a need for information has to be done in careful process. Defining needs and requirements, building a business case around this and then carefully working out the specifications and all organizational aspects of the monitoring program are prerequisites for effective implementation and to prevent surprises and disappointment.

T1  - Toxic Picoplanktonic Cyanobacteria-Review
AN  - 1672888722
AB  - Cyanobacteria of a picoplanktonic cell size (0.2 to 2.0 µm) are common organisms of both freshwater and marine ecosystems. However, due to their small size and relatively short study history, picoplanktonic cyanobacteria, in contrast to the microplanktonic cyanobacteria, still remains a poorly studied fraction of plankton. So far, only little information on picocyanobacteria toxicity has been reported, while the number of reports concerning their presence in ecosystems is increasing. Thus, the issue of picocyanobacteria toxicity needs more researchers' attention and interest. In this report, we present information on the current knowledge concerning the picocyanobacteria toxicity, as well as their harmfulness and problems they can cause.

T1  - Ecosystem regime change inferred from the distribution of trace metals in Lake Erie sediments
AN  - 1898206161
AB  - Many freshwater and coastal marine ecosystems across the world may have undergone an ecosystem regime change due to a combination of rising anthropogenic disturbances and regional climate change. Such a change in aquatic ecosystems is commonly seen as shifts in algal species. But considerably less detail is known about the eutrophication history in terms of changes in algal productivity, particularly for a large lake with a great deal of spatial variability. Here we present an analysis of trace metals (Cu, Ni, Cd, and Pb) on a sediment core recovered from Lake Erie, off the Vermilion coast of northern Ohio, USA, to reconstruct the eutrophication history of the lake over the past 210 years. Following a slow eutrophication during European settlement, Lake Erie experienced a period of accelerated eutrophication, leading to an ecosystem regime transition into a eutrophic lake state in 1950. Our results suggested that the lake's biological productivity has ever since maintained fairly high even though a significant input reduction was realized from rigorous nutrient abatements that began as early as in 1969. This work underscored the role of in-lake biogeochemical cycling in nutrient dynamics of this already eutrophic lake.

AN  - 1620230761
AB  - This paper seeks to identify the biomarker response to oxidative stress in Astyanax bimaculatus, a freshwater fish, collected from the Una River and its associated water bodies. The fish were collected using fishing nets at three different points on the river basin, namely Fazenda Piloto (FP), Ipiranga (IP) and Remédios (RM), during the period from December 2013 to March 2014. Physical and chemical analyses of the water at the sample locations indicate that IP and RM possibly have larger concentration of either natural or anthropic pollutants as compared to FP. FP can therefore be considered as the point less impacted by pollutants than other points. Hepatic activity of antioxidant stress enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), were measured in the specimens. The levels of SOD were reduced at RM while they were elevated in fish collected at IP. The CAT levels for the fish at RM and IP were about 148.9% and 202.4% above the values at FP, respectively. These results suggest that antioxidant enzymes could be used as biomarkers to measure oxidative stress caused by pollutants in the Una River Basin.

T1  - Material Ecocriticism
AN  - 2131836152
AB  - Material Ecocriticism offers new ways to analyze language and reality, human and nonhuman life, mind and matter, without falling into well-worn paths of thinking. Bringing ecocriticism closer to the material turn, the contributions to this landmark volume focus on material forces and substances, the agency of things, processes, narratives and stories, and making meaning out of the world. This broad-ranging reflection on contemporary human experience and expression provokes new understandings of the planet to which we are intimately connected.

T1  - In Vivo Models for Drug Discovery
AN  - 2130947847
AB  - This one-stop reference presents the complete picture - covering all relevant organisms and physiological functions, from single cells to mammals, as well as all major disease areas.
 
 This handbook adopts a broad perspective on the use of animals in the early part of the drug development process, including regulatory rules and limitations, as well as numerous examples from real-life drug development projects.
 
 After a general introduction to the topic, the expert contributors discuss the basic considerations of using animal models, including ethical issues. The main part of the book systematically surveys the most important disease areas for current drug development, from cardiovascular to endocrine, gastro-intestinal, urogenital disorders, cancer, migraine and chronic pain, and from infectious to neuropsychiatric diseases. For each area, the availability of animal models for target validation, hit finding and lead profiling is reviewed, backed by numerous examples of both successes and failures among the use of animal models. The whole is rounded off with a discussion of perspectives and challenges.
 
 Key knowledge for drug researchers in industry as well as academia.

T1  - Validation of an automated data collection method for quantifying social networks in collective behaviours
AN  - 1545169848
AB  - The social network of preferences among group members can affect the distribution and consequences of collective behaviours. However, the behavioural contexts and taxa in which social network structure has been described are still limited because such studies require extensive data. Here, we highlight the use of an automated passive integrated transponder (PIT)-tag monitoring system for social network analyses and do so in a novel context--nestling provisioning in an avian cooperative breeder, for which direct observation of social behaviours is difficult. First, we used observers and cameras to arrive at a suitable metric of nest visit synchrony in the PIT-tag data. Second, we validated the use of this metric for social network analyses using internal nest video cameras. Third, we used hierarchical regression models with 'sociality' parameter to investigate structure of networks collected from multiple groups. Use of PIT tags led to nest visitation duration and frequency being obtained with a high degree of accuracy for all group members, except for the breeding female for whom accurate estimations required the use of a video camera due to her high variability in visitation time. The PIT-tag dataset uncovered significant variability in social network structure. Our results highlight the importance of combining complementary observation methods when conducting social network analyses of wild animals. Our methods can also be generalised to multiple contexts in social systems wherever repeated encounters with other individuals in closed space have ecological implications.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - NMR Spectroscopy:&nbsp;A Versatile Tool for Environmental Research
AN  - 2131223000
AB  - The challenges faced by environmental scientists today are vast, complex, and multi-faceted.  For instance, predicting the fate of an environmental pollutant or understanding ecosystem responses to climate change, necessitate a firm understanding of molecular structure and dynamics of environmental media as well as the components that exist and interact within this media.  Furthermore, linking information obtained at the molecular-scale to ecosystem-level processes is a major pursuit of modern environmental research.  As such, NMR spectroscopy and its scalability from the molecular-scale to the macroscopic-scale, is facilitating rapid growth in environmental science. In addition, the versatility of NMR spectroscopy has resulted in the development and implementation of different types of NMR techniques to examine the structure of various types of environmental samples, living and non-living, as well as the study of critical environmental processes.
 
 This comprehensive handbook is a collection of chapters that span from methods to how NMR is used in environmental research to gain insight into various ecosystem properties. 
 It is organized into three parts: 
 

Part A focuses on methods used in environmental NMR which span from solution-state to magnetic resonance imaging.  

Part B emphasizes how NMR spectroscopy plays an essential role in understanding various types of environmental components and related processes, including different forms of organic matter found in soil, water, and air as well as how NMR is used to probe the fate of water, organic pollutants, and metals in the environment.  

Part C focuses on the growing field of environmental metabolomics which uses NMR as its main discovery platform.   
This volume highlights the immense potential of NMR spectroscopy to expand our fundamental understanding of environmental processes and how it will continue to do so well into the future.

Environmental chemistry research
Our research group studies environmental processes at the molecular-level. We use advanced analytical tools (namely mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) to understand the structure and environmental reactivity of natural organic matter found in soils, sediments, water, and ice.
 We use advanced analytical tools to study the stability of natural organic matter with climate change.  We also study the sorption mechanisms of problematic organic contaminants to soils and sediments.  We are developing novel environmental metabolomic methods for the rapid and quantitative risk assessment of contaminated soil and water.
 The overall goal of our research is to improve the fundamental understanding of environmental processes at the molecular-level. By doing so, we hope to increase the knowledge of several environmental processes and directly apply this knowledge to solve pressing environmental problems.

T1  - Practical Food Safety:&nbsp;Contemporary Issues and Future Directions
AN  - 2131183408
AB  - The past few years have witnessed an upsurge in incidences relating to food safety issues, which are all attributed to different factors. Today, with the increase in knowledge and available databases on food safety issues, the world is witnessing tremendous efforts towards the development of new, economical and environmentally-friendly techniques for maintaining the quality of perishable foods and agro-based commodities. The intensification of food safety concerns reflects a major global awareness of foods in world trade. Several recommendations have been put forward by various world governing bodies and committees to solve food safety issues, which are all mainly targeted at benefiting consumers. In addition, economic losses and instability to a particular nation or region caused by food safety issues can be huge. Various 'non-dependent' risk factors can be involved with regard to food safety in a wide range of food commodities such as fresh fruits, vegetables, seafood, poultry, meat and meat products. Additionally, food safety issues involves a wide array of issues  including processed foods, packaging, post-harvest preservation, microbial growth and spoilage, food poisoning, handling at the manufacturing units, food additives, presence of banned chemicals and drugs, and more. Rapid change in climatic conditions is also playing a pivotal role with regard to food safety issues, and increasing the anxiety about our ability to feed the world safely. 

Practical Food Safety: Contemporary Issues and Future Directions takes a multi-faceted approach to the subject of food safety, covering various aspects ranging from microbiological to chemical issues, and from basic knowledge to future perspectives. This is a book exclusively designed to simultaneously encourage consideration of the present knowledge and future possibilities of food safety. This book also covers the classic topics required for all books on food safety, and encompasses the most recent updates in the field. Leading researchers have addressed new issues and have put forth novel research findings that will affect the world in the future, and suggesting how these should be faced. 
This book will be useful for researchers engaged in the field of food science and food safety, food industry personnel engaged in safety aspects, and governmental and non-governmental agencies involved in establishing guidelines towards establishing safety measures for food and agricultural commodities.

T1  - Symbiosis in Fishes:&nbsp;The Biology of Interspecific Partnerships
AN  - 2131304568
AB  - Symbiosis between Fishes and Invertebrates provides comprehensive coverage of the biology of partnerships between fishes and invertebrates, ascending the phylogenetic scale, from luminescent bacteria, sponges and coelenterates to molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms. Both facultative and obligatory partnerships are reviewed with emphasis on the behavioral, ecological and evolutionary aspects of fish symbiosis. Each of the eight chapters of this book focuses on a different group of partners. The structure, physiology and anti-predatory strategies of each group are described to provide the necessary background for the understanding of their partnerships with fishes. The formation of the associations, the degree of partner specificity and its regulation, as well as the benefits and costs for the fishes and their associates, communication between partners and their possible co-evolution are discussed in each chapter. This is the first attempt to critically review in a single volume all associations of fishes with invertebrates based on the latest studies in these areas, together with studies published many years ago and little cited since then. Symbiosis between Fishes and Invertebrates provides a huge wealth of information that will be of great use and interest to many life scientists including fish biologists, ecologists, ethologists, aquatic scientists, physiologists and evolutionary biologists. It is hoped that the contents of the book will stimulate many to further research, to fill in the gaps in our knowledge in this fascinating and important subject. Libraries in all universities and research establishments where biological sciences are studied and taught should have copies of this exciting book.Symbiosis between Fishes and Invertebrates provides comprehensive coverage of the biology of partnerships between fishes and invertebrates, ascending the phylogenetic scale, from luminescent bacteria, sponges and coelenterates to molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms.

T1  - Ontario now has invasive species app: EDDMapS Ontario
AN  - 1512578683
AB  - ever they are. It's that simple! "Preventing invasive species from arriving and becoming established in Ontario is critical in our fight against this growing threat," says David Orazietti, Ontario Minister of Natural Resources. "Ontario is proud to be working in partnership with OFAH on the development of the EDDMapS Ontario App. The app will serve as a key prevention tool helping Ontario to detect and track the spread of invasive species and, along with Ontario's proposed Invasive Species Act, will make Ontario a national leader in invasive species prevention and management."

              
"Preventing the introduction of invasive species into Ontario woods and waters is everyone's responsibility," says OFAH executive director Angelo Lombardo. "EDDMapS Ontario is another tool in our efforts to prevent invasive species introductions. We certainly hope that you'll join us in this fight to protect this province's fish and wildlife by signing up online and downloading this app to start tracking invasive species in your area."

T1  - Transformation Products of Emerging Contaminants in the Environment:&nbsp;Analysis, Processes, Occurrence, Effects and Risks
AN  - 2131755851
AB  - Over the last 15 years, the focus of chemical pollution has shifted from conventional pollutants to so-called "emerging" or "new" unregulated contaminants. These include pharmaceuticals and personal care products, hormones, UV filters, perfluorinated compounds, poylybrominated flame retardants (BFRs), pesticides, plasticizers, artificial sweeteners, illicit drugs, and endocrine disruptor compounds (EDCs). Despite the increasing number of published studies covering emerging contaminants, we know almost nothing about the effects of their transformation products and/or metabolites. 
This two-volume set provides a unique collection of research on transformation products, their occurrence, fate and risks in the environment. It contains 32 chapters, organised into 7 parts, each with a distinct focus:
 
 * General Considerations
 
 * Transformation Processes and Treatment Strategies
 
 * Analytical Strategies
 
 * Occurrence, Fate and Effects in the Environment
 
 * Global Speciality and Environmental Status
 
 * Risk Assessment, Management and Regulatory Framework
 
 * Outlook 

Transformation Products of Emerging Contaminants in the Environment is a valuable resource for researchers and industry professionals in environmental chemistry, analytical chemistry, ecotoxicology, environmental sciences, and hydrology, as well as environmental consultants and regulatory bodies.

T1  - Protective Effect of Wheat Peptides against Indomethacin-Induced Oxidative Stress in IEC-6 Cells
AN  - 1537098409
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that wheat peptides protected rats against non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs-induced small intestinal epithelial cells damage, but the mechanism of action is unclear. In the present study, an indomethacin-induced oxidative stress model was used to investigate the effect of wheat peptides on the nuclear factor-κB(NF-κB)-inducible nitric oxide synthase-nitric oxide signal pathway in intestinal epithelial cells-6 cells. IEC-6 cells were treated with wheat peptides (0, 125, 500 and 2000 mg/L) for 24 h, followed by 90 mg/L indomethacin for 12 h. Wheat peptides significantly attenuated the indomethacin-induced decrease in superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity. Wheat peptides at 2000 mg/L markedly decreased the expression of the NF-κB in response to indomethacin-induced oxidative stress. This study demonstrated that the addition of wheat peptides to a culture medium significantly inhibited the indomethacin-induced release of malondialdehyde and nitrogen monoxide, and increased antioxidant enzyme activity in IEC-6 cells, thereby providing a possible explanation for the protective effect proposed for wheat peptides in the prevention of indomethacin-induced oxidative stress in small intestinal epithelial cells.

T1  - The Freshwater Sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis Harbours Diverse Pseudomonas Species (Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonadales) with Broad-Spectrum Antimicrobial Activity
AN  - 1497406288
AB  - Bacteria are believed to play an important role in the fitness and biochemistry of sponges (Porifera). Pseudomonas species (Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonadales) are capable of colonizing a broad range of eukaryotic hosts, but knowledge of their diversity and function in freshwater invertebrates is rudimentary. We assessed the diversity, structure and antimicrobial activities of Pseudomonas spp. in the freshwater sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis. Polymerase Chain Reaction – Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprints of the global regulator gene gacA revealed distinct structures between sponge-associated and free-living Pseudomonas communities, unveiling previously unsuspected diversity of these assemblages in freshwater. Community structures varied across E. fluviatilis specimens, yet specific gacA phylotypes could be detected by PCR-DGGE in almost all sponge individuals sampled over two consecutive years. By means of whole-genome fingerprinting, 39 distinct genotypes were found within 90 fluorescent Pseudomonas isolates retrieved from E. fluviatilis. High frequency of in vitro antibacterial (49%), antiprotozoan (35%) and anti-oomycetal (32%) activities was found among these isolates, contrasting less-pronounced basidiomycetal (17%) and ascomycetal (8%) antagonism. Culture extracts of highly predation-resistant isolates rapidly caused complete immobility or lysis of cells of the protozoan Colpoda steinii. Isolates tentatively identified as P. jessenii, P. protegens and P. oryzihabitans showed conspicuous inhibitory traits and correspondence with dominant sponge-associated phylotypes registered by cultivation-independent analysis. Our findings suggest that E. fluviatilis hosts both transient and persistent Pseudomonas symbionts displaying antimicrobial activities of potential ecological and biotechnological value.

T1  - Coffins of the Brave:&nbsp;Lake Shipwrecks of the War of 1812
AN  - 2131207330
AB  - In Coffins of the Brave: Lake Shipwrecks of the War of 1812, archaeologist Kevin J. Crisman and his fellow contributors examine sixteen different examples of 1812-era naval and commercial shipbuilding. They range from four small prewar vessels to four 16- or 20-gun brigs, three warships of much greater size, a steamboat hull converted into an armed schooner, two gunboats, and two postwar schooners. Despite their differing degrees of preservation and archaeological study, each vessel reveals something about how its creators sought the best balance of strength, durability, capacity, stability, speed, weatherliness, and seaworthiness for the anticipated naval struggle on the lakes along the US-Canadian border. The underwater archaeology reported here has guided a new approach to understanding the events of 1812–15, one that blends the evidence in contemporary documents and images with a wealth of details derived from objects lost, discarded, and otherwise left behind. This heavily illustrated volume balances scholarly findings with lively writing, interjecting the adventure of working on shipwrecks and archaeological finds into the investigation and interpretation of a war that continues to attract interest two centuries after it was fought.

T1  - Bivalve Omics: State of the Art and Potential Applications for the Biomonitoring of Harmful Marine Compounds
AN  - 1535665915
AB  - The extraordinary progress experienced by sequencing technologies and bioinformatics has made the development of omic studies virtually ubiquitous in all fields of life sciences nowadays. However, scientific attention has been quite unevenly distributed throughout the different branches of the tree of life, leaving molluscs, one of the most diverse animal groups, relatively unexplored and without representation within the narrow collection of well established model organisms. Within this Phylum, bivalve molluscs play a fundamental role in the functioning of the marine ecosystem, constitute very valuable commercial resources in aquaculture, and have been widely used as sentinel organisms in the biomonitoring of marine pollution. Yet, it has only been very recently that this complex group of organisms became a preferential subject for omic studies, posing new challenges for their integrative characterization. The present contribution aims to give a detailed insight into the state of the art of the omic studies and functional information analysis of bivalve molluscs, providing a timely perspective on the available data resources and on the current and prospective applications for the biomonitoring of harmful marine compounds.

T1  - Anti-Biofilm Performance of Three Natural Products against Initial Bacterial Attachment
AN  - 1526024396
AB  - Marine bacteria contribute significantly towards the fouling consortium, both directly (modern foul release coatings fail to prevent "slime" attachment) and indirectly (biofilms often excrete chemical cues that attract macrofouling settlement). This study assessed the natural product anti-biofilm performance of an extract of the seaweed, Chondrus crispus, and two isolated compounds from terrestrial sources, (+)-usnic acid and juglone, against two marine biofilm forming bacteria, Cobetia marina and Marinobacter hydrocarbonoclasticus. Bioassays were developed using quantitative imaging and fluorescent labelling to test the natural products over a range of concentrations against initial bacterial attachment. All natural products affected bacterial attachment; however, juglone demonstrated the best anti-biofilm performance against both bacterial species at a concentration range between 5-20 ppm. In addition, for the first time, a dose-dependent inhibition (hormetic) response was observed for natural products against marine biofilm forming bacteria.

T1  - Questioning continued involvement in lake measuring system development
AN  - 1441383684
AB  - A flagship project of the society is Living By Water which has been underway for four years in partnership with Nature Alberta led primarily by Steven Johnson, Kim Schmitt and Brian Saby. After four years, 67 property owners have enrolled for the home assessment program where representatives from Nature Alberta work with them to look at how they're living by the lake and suggest ways to improve their affect on the area. "It's become so important to us that the board agreed to contribute $4,000 to work around Sylvan Lake on assessments," said [Graeme Strathdee]. A report on the work in 2013 is posted on the society's website. Participants also get a 'Watershed Steward' sign sponsored by the Kent Williamson Memorial Fund that recognizes their commitment to a healthy watershed. Strathdee stated "no nutrients is good nutrients" while showing a graph of total phosphorous in lake water analysis over many years. "It shows how close we are to the line which is where the lake becomes more sensitive to blue green algae."

T1  - Marine Microbiology:&nbsp;Bioactive Compounds and Biotechnological Applications
AN  - 2131376667
AB  - Deliberately breaking with the classical biology-centered description of marine organisms and their products, this reference emphasizes microbial technology over basic biology, setting it apart from its predecessors. As such, it systematically covers the technology behind high-value compounds for use as pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals or
 cosmetics, from prospecting to production issues.
 
 Following a definition of the field, the book goes on to address all industrially important aspects of marine microbial biotechnology. The first main part contains a description of the major production organisms, from archaebacteria to cyanobacteria to algae and symbionts, including their genetic engineering. The remaining four parts look at commercially important compounds produced by these microorganisms together with their applications. Throughout, the emphasis is on technological considerations, and the future potential of these organisms or compound classes is discussed. A valuable and forward-looking resource for innovative biotechnologists in industry as well as in academia.Deliberately breaking with the classical biology-centered description of marine organisms and their products, this reference emphasizes microbial technology over basic biology, setting it apart from its predecessors.

T1  - Invasive plants travel easily
AN  - 1431940480
AB  - "Transferring plant parts or seeds of invasive plants to new locations without the natural enemies that keep them in check in their native areas gives them a competitive advantage over native B.C. plant species," said NWIPC spokesperson Steven Kiiskila. 

              
In the [Burns Lake] area, the common tansy, marsh plume thistle and field scabious are invasive species gaining a toehold in the area. It is important, Kiiskila said, to be able to recognize and identify invasive plants so that you can avoided spreading them. 

              
"Most invasive plant seed remain viable after passing through a horse's gut," said Kiiskila. "It is important to feed weed-free forage for at least three days before a trip. Seeds can also be brought in accidentally as a contaminant in hay, pellets or unclean grain."

T1  - Trolling Big-Water Walleyes:&nbsp;Secrets of the Great Lakes Fishing Guides, Charter Captains, and Walleye Pros
AN  - 2134607377
AB  - Experts reveal surefire methods for walleye trolling, equipment techniques, tactics, and moreOn big, open water like the Great Lakes, sprawling Western reservoirs, and large North American rivers, trolling puts more walleyes in the boat-hour for hour-than any other fishing method. Why? Because if done correctly, the lure or bait is always in the fish's strike zone. If anglers do it wrong, all they will net is a long, frustrating boat ride. In this detailed instructional guide, generously illustrated with more than 50 color photos and complemented by time-tested fish-catching secrets from 17 professional fishing authorities, fishermen will learn to catch walleyes from those who chase this highly prized sport fish for a living.A veteran walleye angler himself, author Chip Gross covers every aspect of walleye trolling, offering advice on basic and advanced trolling equipment, trolling setups throughout the fishing year, choosing crankbaits and other lures, determining when and where to fish, night trolling for walleyes, purchasing and rigging a boat for walleye trolling, and how to catch that trophy walleye of a lifetime. Information on cleaning and caring for the catch, as well as Gross's favorite walleye recipe, is also included.Walleyes are finicky, will-o'-the-wisp fish, often here today and gone tomorrow. They follow schools of baitfish like hungry wolf packs; as the bait moves, they move. Often this translates to anglers enjoying spectacular fishing one day but getting scarcely a bite, or possibly none at all, the next. Successful trolling can seem like an unattainable goal, but Trolling Big-Water Walleyes makes that goal easier to reach.

AB  - Organizing for Sustainable Effectiveness highlights research and practice aimed at understanding how organizations and more inclusive systems of actors develop a continuous, unfaltering focus on sustainability. It will examine how they organize to achieve expanded purposes, the associated changes in purpose and governance, relationships among various stakeholders, boundaries between organizations and other elements of the environment in which they operate, organizational systems and processes, leadership, competencies and capabilities. Thus 'sustainability' is seen as entailing a continuous dynamic adaptive process in people, organizations and systems, striving to be as proactive as possible, moving 'upstream' in improving and developing organizational processes and issues.

T1  - Devouring Dragon:&nbsp;How China's Rise Threatens the Natural World
AN  - 2140924940
AB  - For this brilliant book, author Craig Simons visited many of the places and spoke to many of the people impacted by China’s explosive economic growth and voracious appetite for resources. From New Guinea, where great forests are being felled and rare birds threatened to meet China’s demand for timber; through Brazil, where large swaths of the Amazon are being cleared to plant soybeans for China, and India, where poachers are hunting and killing tigers and other endangered animals to extinction to feed Chinese demand; to Australia, where the countryside is being polluted by mines that supply coal to China, this study paints a devastating portrait of the many communities being ravaged to satisfy Chinese consumption. 
The Devouring Dragon looks at how an ascending China has rapidly surpassed the United States and Europe as the worst-polluting superpower and asks questions that demand urgent answers if the environment is to survive.

T1  - Comparative Biomechanics : Life's Physical World (Second Edition):&nbsp;Life's Physical World (Second Edition)
AN  - 2136047515
AB  - Why do you switch from walking to running at a specific speed? Why do tall trees rarely blow over in high winds? And why does a spore ejected into air at seventy miles per hour travel only a fraction of an inch? 
Comparative Biomechanics is the first and only textbook that takes a comprehensive look at the mechanical aspects of life--covering animals and plants, structure and movement, and solids and fluids. An ideal entry point into the ways living creatures interact with their immediate physical world, this revised and updated edition examines how the forms and activities of animals and plants reflect the materials available to nature, considers rules for fluid flow and structural design, and explores how organisms contend with environmental forces.
 Drawing on physics and mechanical engineering, Steven Vogel looks at how animals swim and fly, modes of terrestrial locomotion, organism responses to winds and water currents, circulatory and suspension-feeding systems, and the relationship between size and mechanical design. He also investigates links between the properties of biological materials--such as spider silk, jellyfish jelly, and muscle--and their structural and functional roles. Early chapters and appendices introduce relevant physical variables for quantification, and problem sets are provided at the end of each chapter. 
Comparative Biomechanics is useful for physical scientists and engineers seeking a guide to state-of-the-art biomechanics. For a wider audience, the textbook establishes the basic biological context for applied areas--including ergonomics, orthopedics, mechanical prosthetics, kinesiology, sports medicine, and biomimetics--and provides materials for exhibit designers at science museums.

Problem sets at the ends of chapters 
Appendices cover basic background information 
Updated and expanded documentation and materials 
Revised figures and text 
Increased coverage of friction, viscoelastic materials, surface tension, diverse modes of locomotion, and biomimetics

T1  - Unique Hepatic Cytosolic Arginase Evolved Independently in Ureogenic Freshwater Air-Breathing Teleost, Heteropneustes fossilis
AN  - 1370183752
AB  - Hepatic cytosolic arginase (ARG I), an enzyme of the urea cycle operating in the liver of ureotelic animals, is reported to be present in an ammoniotelic freshwater air-breathing teleost, Heteropneustes fossilis which has ureogenic potential. Antibodies available against mammalian ARG I showed no cross reactivity with the H. fossilis ARG I. We purified unique ARG I from H. fossilis liver. Purified ARG I is a homotrimer with molecular mass 75 kDa and subunit molecular mass of 24 kDa. The pI value of the enzyme was 8.5. It showed maximum activity at pH 10.5 and 55°C. The Km of purified enzyme for L-arginine was 2.65±0.39 mM. L-ornithine and Nω-hydroxy-L-arginine showed inhibition of the ARG I activity, with Ki values 0.52±0.02 mM and 0.08±0.006 mM, respectively. Antibody raised against the purified fish liver ARG I showed exclusive specificity, and has no cross reactivity against fish liver ARG II and mammalian liver ARG I and ARG II. We found another isoform of arginase bound to the outer membrane of the mitochondria which was released by 150–200 mM KCl in the extraction medium. This isoform was immunologically different from the soluble cytosolic and mitochondrial arginase. The results of present study support that hepatic cytosolic arginase evolved in this ureogenic freshwater teleost, H. fossilis. Phylogenetic analysis confirms an independent evolution event that occurred much after the evolution of the cytosolic arginase of ureotelic vertebrates.

T1  - Courtship Sounds Advertise Species Identity and Male Quality in Sympatric Pomatoschistus spp. Gobies
AN  - 1365188418
AB  - Acoustic signals can encode crucial information about species identity and individual quality. We recorded and compared male courtship drum sounds of the sand goby Pomatoschistus minutus and the painted goby P. pictus and examined if they can function in species recognition within sympatric populations. We also examined which acoustic features are related to male quality and the factors that affect female courtship in the sand goby, to determine whether vocalisations potentially play a role in mate assessment. Drums produced by the painted goby showed significantly higher dominant frequencies, higher sound pulse repetition rates and longer intervals between sounds than those of the sand goby. In the sand goby, male quality was predicted by visual and acoustic courtship signals. Regression analyses showed that sound amplitude was a good predictor of male length, whereas the duration of nest behaviour and active calling rate (i.e. excluding silent periods) were good predictors of male condition factor and fat reserves respectively. In addition, the level of female courtship was predicted by male nest behaviour. The results suggest that the frequency and temporal patterns of sounds can encode species identity, whereas sound amplitude and calling activity reflects male size and fat reserves. Visual courtship duration (nest-related behaviour) also seems relevant to mate choice, since it reflects male condition and is related to female courtship. Our work suggests that acoustic communication can contribute to mate choice in the sand goby group, and invites further study.

T1  - Seashore Organism in Penang National Park
AN  - 2131121812
AB  - This is the first field guide for the seashore organisms in Penang National Park, Penang, Malaysia to present the magnificent seashore species that make up a striking diversity in this natural environment.  The content of this book are largely restricted to the organisms that are most frequently encountered or interesting to be documented; displayed by colour photographs, taken in their natural habitats; their taxonomic positions are indicated, brief descriptions are provided and together with the details of their known geographic distribution (types of habitat and distribution zone). The images in the field guide were also taken with uniform background, with views from the ventral, dorsal, side and close-up (for important identification) to assist the readers/users for clear visual identification of the organisms they encountered.  This book aims to stimulate interest in seashore ecosystems and will broaden the general knowledge of the interested layman and the scientific visitor of coastal seashore areas regarding biodiversity.  It will also help both institutions and individuals to develop an appreciation of broader environmental concerns.

T1  - Variations in the Microcystin Content of Different Fish Species Collected from a Eutrophic Lake
AN  - 1537947024
AB  - Microcystins produced from cyanobacteria can accumulate in fish tissues. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is an attractive alternative to immunoassays for the determination of low concentrations of microcystins in tissues. Fish taken from Grand Lake St. Marys, a eutrophic lake in Ohio, USA, were analyzed for microcystin-LR in their fillets using LC-MS/MS. Of 129 fish tested for microcystins, only black crappie (Pomoxis nigromaculatus) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio) tested positive for microcystin-LR. Less than 10% of Pomoxis and 7% of Cyprinus samples contained measurable levels of microcystin-LR. Statistical analysis yielded a p-value of 0.07 between Pomoxis and the pooled results of the other four fish species. However, this comparison was complicated by the large difference in sample size between species. Further sampling in Grand Lake St. Marys for microcystin-LR would help determine if microcystin-LR exposure occurs through foodweb transfer.

T1  - Black Swan Lake:&nbsp;Life of a Wetland
AN  - 2132015165
AB  - Tracing the life of the plants and animals of Forrestdale Lake through the six seasons of the local indigenous people, the first part of Black Swan Lake presents a wetlands calendar over a yearly cycle of the rising, falling and drying waters of this internationally important wetland in south-western Australia. The second part of this book considers issues and explores themes from the first part, including a cultural history of the seasons and the black swan. Black Swan Lake is a book of nature writing and environmental history and philosophy arising from living in a particular place with other beings. The book is a guide to living simply and sustainably with the earth in troubled times and places by making and maintaining a strong attachment and vital connection to a local place and its flora and fauna. Local places and their living processes sustain human and other life on this living earth.

T1  - Wetland Landscape Characterization:&nbsp;Practical Tools, Methods, and Approaches for Landscape Ecology, Second Edition
AN  - 2135752845
AB  - Wetlands are, by their very nature, ephemeral and transitional, which makes them challenging to characterize. Yet the need for characterizing wetlands continues to grow, particularly as we develop a better understanding of the wealth of ecosystem services that they provide. Wetland Landscape Characterization: Practical Tools, Methods, and Approaches for Landscape Ecology, Second Edition shows how wetland characterization tools, methods, and approaches can be integrated to more effectively address twenty-first-century wetland issues. A Practical Toolbox for Integrated Wetland Landscape Characterization The book explains how to locate, identify, and map the extent of wetlands to learn more about their importance to society and the larger landscape. It examines jurisdictional, regulatory, and practical applications from the scientific, engineering, and lay perspectives. Fully updated, the second edition reflects an emerging infrastructural, ecosystem goods-and-services perspective to better assist readers who may encounter these concepts and challenges as they assess and characterize wetlands. Examples and case studies illustrate a variety of situations and solutions, highlighting the use of current techniques to assess, inventory, and monitor natural resources under changing conditions. These examples offer lessons and ideas for the issues encountered every day by wetland landscape ecology practitioners. The book also refers readers to additional resources to help them solve specific challenges. New in This Edition Updates of practical geospatial methods More project-driven examples A description of the pitfalls of using ecological data at landscape scales, along with solutions Alternative techniques for a variety of practitioners Linkages between field and landscape ecological practices Online resources for practitioners New illustrations This book helps readers develop the concepts, skills, and understanding of how to best achieve project goals in the rapidly changing disciplines of landscape science and wetland ecology and management. A valuable resource, it provides practical tools, methods, and approaches for conceptualizing, designing, and implementing broad-scale wetland projects that take into account critical societal linkages.

T1  - Infectious salmon anaemia virus infection of Atlantic salmon gill epithelial cells
AN  - 1283159490; 23282149
AB  - Doc number: 5              Abstract: Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV), a member of the Orthomyxoviridae  family, infects and causes disease in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar  L.). Previous studies have shown Atlantic salmon endothelial cells to be the primary targets of ISAV infection. However, it is not known if cells other than endothelial cells play a role in ISAV tropism. To further assess cell tropism, we examined ISAV infection of Atlantic salmon gill epithelial cells in vivo  and in vitro . We demonstrated the susceptibility of epithelial cells to ISAV infection. On comparison of primary gill epithelial cell cultures with ISAV permissive fish cell cultures, we found the virus yield in primary gill epithelial cells to be comparable with that of salmon head kidney (SHK)-1 cells, but lower than TO or Atlantic salmon kidney (ASK)-II cells. Light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that the primary gill cells possessed characteristics consistent with epithelial cells. Virus histochemistry showed that gill epithelial cells expressed 4-O -acetylated sialic acid which is recognized as the ISAV receptor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of ISAV infection in Atlantic salmon primary gill epithelial cells. This study thus broadens our understanding of cell tropism and transmission of ISAV in Atlantic salmon.

T1  - Science for Environmental Protection:&nbsp;The Road Ahead
AN  - 2130965686
AB  - In anticipation of future environmental science and engineering challenges and technologic advances, EPA asked the National Research Council (NRC) to assess the overall capabilities of the agency to develop, obtain, and use the best available scientific and technologic information and tools to meet persistent, emerging, and future mission challenges and opportunities. Although the committee cannot predict with certainty what new environmental problems EPA will face in the next 10 years or more, it worked to identify some of the common drivers and common characteristics of problems that are likely to occur. 
Tensions inherent to the structure of EPA's work contribute to the current and persistent challenges faced by the agency, and meeting those challenges will require development of leading-edge scientific methods, tools, and technologies, and a more deliberate approach to systems thinking and interdisciplinary science. Science for Environmental Protection: The Road Ahead outlines a framework for building science for environmental protection in the 21st century and identified key areas where enhanced leadership and capacity can strengthen the agency's abilities to address current and emerging environmental challenges as well as take advantage of new tools and technologies to address them. The foundation of EPA science is strong, but the agency needs to continue to address numerous present and future challenges if it is to maintain its science leadership and meet its expanding mandates.

T1  - The Role of Green Chemistry in Biomass Processing and Conversion
AN  - 2131311948
AB  - Sets the stage for the development of sustainable, environmentally friendly fuels, chemicals, and materials 
Taking millions of years to form, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources; it is estimated that they will be depleted by the end of this century. Moreover, the production and use of fossil fuels have resulted in considerable environmental harm. The generation of environmentally friendly energy from renewable sources such as biomass is therefore essential. This book focuses on the integration of green chemistry concepts into biomass processes and conversion in order to take full advantage of the potential of biomass to replace nonsustainable resources and meet global needs for fuel as well as other chemicals and materials. 

The Role of Green Chemistry in Biomass Processing and Conversion features contributions from leading experts from Asia, Europe, and North America. Focusing on lignocellulosic biomass, the most abundant biomass resource, the book begins with a general introduction to biomass and biorefineries and then provides an update on the latest advances in green chemistry that support biomass processing and conversion. Next, the authors describe current and emerging biomass processing and conversion techniques that use green chemistry technologies, including: 
 
Green solvents such as ionic liquids, supercritical CO2, and water 
Sustainable energy sources such as microwave irradiation and sonification 
Green catalytic technologies 
Advanced membrane separation technologies  
The last chapter of the book explores the ecotoxicological and environmental effects of converting and using fuels, chemicals, and materials from biomass. 
Recommended for professionals and students in chemical engineering, green chemistry, and energy and fuels, 
The Role of Green Chemistry in Biomass Processing and Conversion sets a strong foundation for the development of a competitive and sustainable bioeconomy. 

This monograph includes a Foreword by James Clark (University of York, UK).

T1  - Scientific Opinion on the risk for public health related to the presence of mercury and methylmercury in food
AN  - 2568468005
AB  - EFSA was asked by the European Commission to consider new developments regarding inorganic mercury and methylmercury toxicity and evaluate whether the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) provisional tolerable weekly intakes for methylmercury of 1.6 µg/kg body weight (b.w.) and of 4 µg/kg b.w. for inorganic mercury were still appropriate. In line with JECFA, the CONTAM Panel established a tolerable weekly intake (TWI) for inorganic mercury of 4 µg/kg b.w., expressed as mercury. For methylmercury, new developments in epidemiological studies from the Seychelles Child Developmental Study Nutrition Cohort have indicated that n‐3 long‐chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in fish may counteract negative effects from methylmercury exposure. Together with the information that beneficial nutrients in fish may have confounded previous adverse outcomes in child cohort studies from the Faroe Islands, the Panel established a TWI for methylmercury of 1.3 µg/kg b.w., expressed as mercury. The mean dietary exposure across age groups does not exceed the TWI for methylmercury, with the exception of toddlers and other children in some surveys. The 95th percentile dietary exposure is close to or above the TWI for all age groups. High fish consumers, which might include pregnant women, may exceed the TWI by up to approximately six‐fold. Unborn children constitute the most vulnerable group. Biomonitoring data from blood and hair indicate that methylmercury exposure is generally below the TWI in Europe, but higher levels are also observed. Exposure to methylmercury above the TWI is of concern. If measures to reduce methylmercury exposure are considered, the potential beneficial effects of fish consumption should also be taken into account. Dietary inorganic mercury exposure in Europe does not exceed the TWI, but inhalation exposure of elemental mercury from dental amalgam is likely to increase the internal inorganic mercury exposure; thus the TWI might be exceeded.

T1  - Infectious Diseases of Wild Mammals and Birds in Europe
AN  - 2131074632
AB  - Infectious Diseases of Wild Mammals and Birds in Europe is a key resource on the diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases in European wildlife that covers the distinctive nature of diseases as they occur in Europe, including strains, insect vectors, reservoir species, and climate, as well as geographical distribution of the diseases and European regulations for reporting, diagnosis and control. Divided into sections on viral infections, bacterial infections, fungal and yeast infections, and prion infections, this definitive reference provides valuable information on disease classification and properties, causative agents, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and implications for human, domestic and wild animal health. 

KEY FEATURES: 
 
Brings together extensive research from many different disciplines into one integrated and highly useful definitive reference. 
Zoonotic risks to human health, as well as risks to pets and livestock are highlighted. 
Each disease is covered separately with practical information on the animal species in which the disease has been recorded, clinical signs of the disease, diagnostic methods, and recommended treatments and vaccination. 
Wildlife vaccination and disease surveillance techniques are described. 
Examines factors important in the spread of disease such as changing climate, the movement of animals through trade, and relaxations in the control of wild animal populations.  
Written by a team of pathologists, epidemiologists and clinicians from across Europe, this is the definitive resource for infectious diseases of wild mammals and birds in Europe. It will be an invaluable reference for veterinarians, conservation biologists, epidemiologists, and wildlife researchers, managers, rehabilitators and students.

T1  - River Republic:&nbsp;The Fall and Rise of America's Rivers
AN  - 2131269447
AB  - Daniel McCool not only chronicles the history of water development agencies in America and the way in which special interests have abused rather than preserved the country's rivers, he also narrates the second, brighter act in this ongoing story: the surging, grassroots movement to bring these rivers back to life and ensure they remain pristine for future generations. The culmination of ten years of research and observation, McCool's book confirms the surprising news that America's rivers are indeed returning to a healthier, free-flowing condition. The politics of river restoration demonstrates how strong grassroots movements can challenge entrenched powers and win. Through passion and dedication, ordinary people are reclaiming the American landscape, forming a "river republic" of concerned citizens from all backgrounds and sectors of society. As McCool shows, the history, culture, and fate of America is tied to its rivers, and their restoration is a microcosm mirroring American beliefs, livelihoods, and an increasing awareness of what two hundred years of environmental degradation can do. McCool profiles the individuals he calls "instigators," who initiated the fight for these waterways and, despite enormous odds, have succeeded in the near-impossible task of challenging and changing the status quo. Part I of the volume recounts the history of America's relationship to its rivers; part II describes how and why Americans "parted" them out, destroying their essence and diminishing their value; and part III shows how society can live in harmony with its waterways while restoring their well-being—and, by extension, the well-being of those who depend on them.

T1  - Comparative Metagenomics of Toxic Freshwater Cyanobacteria Bloom Communities on Two Continents
AN  - 1326543582
AB  - Toxic cyanobacterial blooms have persisted in freshwater systems around the world for centuries and appear to be globally increasing in frequency and severity. Toxins produced by bloom-associated cyanobacteria can have drastic impacts on the ecosystem and surrounding communities, and bloom biomass can disrupt aquatic food webs and act as a driver for hypoxia. Little is currently known regarding the genomic content of the Microcystis strains that form blooms or the companion heterotrophic community associated with bloom events. To address these issues, we examined the bloom-associated microbial communities in single samples from Lake Erie (North America), Lake Tai (Taihu, China), and Grand Lakes St. Marys (OH, USA) using comparative metagenomics. Together the Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria comprised >90% of each bloom bacterial community sample, although the dominant phylum varied between systems. Relative to the existing Microcystis aeruginosa NIES 843 genome, sequences from Lake Erie and Taihu revealed a number of metagenomic islands that were absent in the environmental samples. Moreover, despite variation in the phylogenetic assignments of bloom-associated organisms, the functional potential of bloom members remained relatively constant between systems. This pattern was particularly noticeable in the genomic contribution of nitrogen assimilation genes. In Taihu, the genetic elements associated with the assimilation and metabolism of nitrogen were predominantly associated with Proteobacteria, while these functions in the North American lakes were primarily contributed to by the Cyanobacteria. Our observations build on an emerging body of metagenomic surveys describing the functional potential of microbial communities as more highly conserved than that of their phylogenetic makeup within natural systems.

T1  - Borders:&nbsp;A Very Short Introduction
AN  - 2131420856
AB  - Compelling and accessible, this Very Short Introduction challenges the perception of borders as passive lines on a map, revealing them instead to be integral forces in the economic, social, political, and environmental processes that shape our lives. Highlighting the historical development and continued relevance of borders, Alexander Diener and Joshua Hagen offer a powerful counterpoint to the idea of an imminent borderless world, underscoring the impact borders have on a range of issues, such as economic development, inter- and intra-state conflict, global terrorism, migration, nationalism, international law, environmental sustainability, and natural resource management. Diener and Hagen demonstrate how and why borders have been, are currently, and will undoubtedly remain hot topics across the social sciences and in the global headlines for years to come. This compact volume will appeal to a broad, interdisciplinary audience of scholars and students, including geographers, political scientists, anthropologists, sociologists, historians, international relations and law experts, as well as lay readers interested in understanding current events.

T1  - Lake Scugog walleye population dwindling
AN  - 1022002203
AB  - "They are catching them, just not hand over fist. But they are getting them," she said of walleye fishing on Lake Scugog this year. "I haven't gotten any complaints."

              
"It's certainly not a typical walleye lake," he said. "The spawning habitat is not what you would find in a textbook."

              
Recent statistics "show clearly that people are not targeting walleye for fishing like they used to" and that there is currently a "social trend" towards bass, said Mr. [Mike Rawson].

T1  - Improving Crop Resistance to Abiotic Stress
AN  - 2131037572
AB  - Dr. Narendra Tuteja did his M.Sc., Ph.D and D.Sc. in Biochemistry from the Lucknow University in 1977, 1982 and 2008, respectively. He is fellow of the Academies of Sciences: FNASc. (2003), FNA (2007), FASc. (2009) and FNESA (2009).
 Dr. Tuteja has made major contributions in the field of plant DNA replication and abiotic stress signal transduction, especially in isolating novel DNA/RNA helicases and several components of calcium and G-proteins signaling pathways. Initially he made pioneer contributions in isolation and characterization of large number of helicases from human cells while he was at ICGEB Trieste and published several papers in high impact journals including EMBO J. and Nucleic Acids Research. From India he has cloned the first plant helicase (Plant J. 2000) and presented the first direct evidence for a novel role of a pea DNA helicase (PNAS, USA, 2005) in salinity stress tolerance and pea heterotrimeric G-proteins (Plant J. 2007) in salinity and heat stress tolerance. Dr. Tuteja has reported the first direct evidence in plant that PLC functions as an effector for Ga subunit of G-proteins. All the above work has received extensive coverage in many journals, including Nature Biotechnology, and bulletins all over the world. His group has also discovered novel substrate (pea CBL) for pea CIPK (FEBS J. 2006). He has already developed the salinity tolerant tobacco and rice plants without affecting yield. Recently, few new high salinity stress tolerant genes (e.g. Lectin receptor like kinase, Chlorophyll a/b binding protein and Ribosomal L30E) have been isolated from Pisum sativum and have been shown to confer high salinity stress tolerance in bacteria and plant (Glycoconjugate J. 2010; Plant Signal. Behav. 2010). Recently, very high salinity stress tolerant genes from fungus Piriformospora indica have been isolated and their functional validation in fungus and plants is in progress. Overall, Dr. Tuteja's research uncovers three new pathways to plant abiotic stress tolerance. His results are an important success and indicate the potential for improving crop production at sub-optimal conditions.
 
 Dr. Sarvajeet Singh Gill did his B.Sc. (1998) from Kanpur University and M.Sc. (2001, Gold Medalist), M. Phil. (2003) and Ph.D (2009) from Aligarh Muslim University.
 Dr. Gill has several research papers, review articles and book chapters to his credit in the journals of national and international repute and in edited books. He has co-edited four books namely Sulfur assimilation and Abiotic Stress in Plants; Eutrophication: causes, consequences and control; Plant Responses to Abiotic Stress, and Abiotic Stress Tolerance published by Springer-Verlag (Germany), IK International, New Delhi, and Bentham Science Publishers, respectively. He was awarded Junior Scientist of the year award by National Environmental Science Academy New Delhi in 2008.
 Presently with Dr. Tuteja, Dr. Gill is working on heterotrimeric G proteins and plant DNA helicases to uncover the abiotic stress tolerance mechanism in rice. The transgenic plants overexpressing heterotrimeric G proteins and plant DNA helicases may be important for improving crop production at sub-optimal conditions.
 
 Dr. Renu Tuteja did her B.Sc. (1975) and M.Sc. (1977) from Lucknow University and Ph.D. (1983) from Kanpur University.
 Dr. Tuteja has made significant contribution in understanding the role of helicases in the DNA and RNA metabolism in malaria parasite and human. She has reported and characterized a number of novel helicases from malaria parasite and human. Recently she has reported the genome wide analysis of helicases from malaria parasite and their comparison with the human host. This work was published in Cell Cycle. She has shown that eukaryotic initiation factor 4A is a dual helicase, essential for the growth and survival of malaria parasite (Journal of Molecular Biology). Her recent work on an RNA helicase from malaria parasite revealed that it is involved in splicing. This work was published as cover image article in Archives in Biochemistry and Biophysics. Her helicase work has received coverage in journals, including a cover image article in Archives in Biochemistry and Biophysics and News and Views article in Cell Cycle. She has characterized novel signal peptidase from malaria parasite and reported its modulation by phosphorylation. Using bioinformatics approach she has reported the existence of all the components of protein translocation pathway and mRNA transport pathway from malaria parasite. Recently she was awarded the Top Cited Paper Award from FEBS J. for one of her article on Malaria published in 2007. Her work has demonstrated novel functions of eIF4A, Ku autoantigen and nucleolin as DNA helicases. On the basis of her interesting discovery of Ku as a helicase, a double-strand break repair model has been proposed in many text books.
 Dr. Tuteja became the first Indian Scientist from India to have published in Nature Genetics (13, 1996) and that also cover image article on helicases. Her recent interests are to understand the basic biology of malaria parasite in order to identify novel drug targets. Her research indicates novel ways to control malaria by inhibiting helicases. Till to date she has published a total of 79 papers in journals of international repute.

AN  - 2134292944
AB  - When we think of wild animals, we don't immediately associate them with the cities we live in. But a closer look soon reveals that we share our urban environment with a great many untamed creatures. Heavily illustrated and full of entertaining and informative facts, City Critters examines how and why so many wild animals choose to live in places that, on first glance at least, seem contrary to their needs. How do those deer, raccoons, squirrels, skunks, coyotes, crows, gulls and geese - not to mention the alligators, eagles, otters and snakes - manage to survive in the big city? What special skills do city critters have that many of their wilderness cousins lack? Why have they developed these skills? And what are our responsibilities in ensuring that these animals can continue to share our city lives?When we think of wild animals, we don't immediately associate them with the cities we live in.

T1  - CAMBIOS ESPACIO-TEMPORALES DEL PLANCTON EN LA CIENAGA DE AYAPEL (CORDOBA-COLOMBIA), DURANTE LA EPOCA DE MENOR NIVEL DEL AGUA
AN  - 1677410263
AB  - Se evaluaron los cambios espaciales y temporales de los ensambles fitoplanctónicos y zooplanctónicos durante la época de menor nivel de agua en la Ciénaga de Ayapel. Se tomaron muestras integradas en toda la columna de agua, en seis estaciones de muestreo, siguiendo el eje longitudinal de la ciénaga en sentido norte-sur, y durante siete días continuos. Durante el período de estudio la ciénaga se comportó como un sistema de aguas blandas, alcalino, altamente turbio, con profundidad y transparencia reducidas, fuertemente mezclado y con diferencias notables a nivel espacial y una alta homogeneidad temporal de sus variables físicas, químicas y biológicas. Ambos ensambles presentaron homogeneidad temporal y diferencias espaciales. Las Cianobacteria representaron el 70% de la densidad total del fitoplancton principalmente Cylindropermopsis raciborskii y Planktolyngbya limnetica y el zooplancton por las formas inmaduras de los copépodos (nauplios principalmente) y rotíferos del género Brachionus.

T1  - Dynamics of Protein Phosphatase Gene Expression in Corbicula fluminea Exposed to Microcystin-LR and to Toxic Microcystis aeruginosa Cells
AN  - 1526007166
AB  - This study investigated the in vivo effects of microcystins on gene expression of several phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPP) in the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea with two different exposure scenarios. Clams were exposed for 96 h to 5 µg L-1 of dissolved microcystin-LR and the relative changes of gene expression of three different types of PPP (PPP1, 2 and 4) were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed a significant induction of PPP2 gene expression in the visceral mass. In contrast, the cyanotoxin did not cause any significant changes on PPP1 and PPP4 gene expression. Based on these results, we studied alterations in transcriptional patterns in parallel with enzymatic activity of C. fluminea for PPP2, induced by a Microcystis aeruginosa toxic strain (1 × 105 cells cm-3) during 96 h. The relative changes of gene expression and enzyme activity in visceral mass were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and colorimetric assays respectively. The clams exhibited a significant reduction of PPP2 activity with a concomitant enhancement of gene expression. Considering all the results we can conclude that the exposure to an ecologically relevant concentration of pure or intracellular microcystins (-LR) promoted an in vivo effect on PPP2 gene expression in C. fluminea.

T1  - Was Man More Aquatic in the Past? Fifty Years After Alister Hardy - Waterside Hypotheses of Human Evolution:&nbsp;Waterside Hypotheses of Human Evolution
AN  - 2130871961
AB  - The book starts from the observation that humans are very different from the other primates. Why are we naked? Why do we speak? Why do we walk upright? Fifty years ago, in 1960, marine biologist Sir Alister Hardy tried to answer this when he announced his so-called aquatic hypothesis: human ancestors did not live in dry savannahs as traditional anthropology assumes, but have adapted to live at the edge between land and water, gathering both terrestrial and aquatic foods. This eBook is an up-to-date collection of the views of the most important protagonists of this long-neglected theory of human evolution at the 50th anniversary of its announcement in 1960. It brings together the views of leading scientists such as anthrolopogy professor Phillip Tobias, marine biologist Richard Ellis, waterbirth gynaecologist Michel Odent, nutritional biologist Michael Crawford and science writer Elaine Morgan.

T1  - Biomarkers and Human Biomonitoring:&nbsp;Volume 1
AN  - 2130863000
AB  - Human biomonitoring has developed from a research tool in occupational and environmental health to identify and quantify exposures to harmful substances in urine or blood. The analytical methods for detection of substances in biological media have been considerably improved with smaller detection limits and more precise and specific measurements. Human biomonitoring is a valuable tool in exposure estimation of selected populations and currently used in surveillance programs all over the world. This two-volume handbook provides an overview of current available biomarkers and human biomonitoring programs in environmental health, which is timely given the present debate on adverse health effects from environmental exposures. The books describe both previous and ongoing studies as well as the newer biomarkers of exposure and effects. Volume One describes current human biomonitoring activities in Germany, Romania, France, Canada, India, and Belgium, providing convincing evidence of a global decline in human exposures to lead and increasing concern related to adverse effects from exposures to endocrine disruptors and genotoxic compound. The book also includes chapters on biomarkers of specific exposures in a range of widely used everyday compounds such as phthalates, PFCs, bisphenol A, brominated flame retardants, lead, PAHs, dioxins, mercury and arsenic.Human biomonitoring has developed from a research tool in occupational and environmental health to identify and quantify exposures to harmful substances in urine or blood.

T1  - When Biospheres Collide: a History of NASA's Planetary Protection Programs:&nbsp;A History of NASA's Planetary Protection Programs
AN  - 2136049476
AB  - PRINT FORMAT ONLY NOTE: NO FURTHER DISCOUNT FOR THIS PRINT PRODUCT- OVERSTOCK SALE -- Significantly reduced list price This new book from the NASA History Series tackles an interesting duo of biological problems that will be familiar to anybody who has seen photos of Apollo astronauts quarantined after their return to Earth. Namely, how do we avoid contaminating celestial bodies with Earthly germs when we send spacecraft to study these bodies, and how do we avoid spreading foreign biological matter from space when our robotic and human spacefarers return to Earth? Biological matter from an external system could potentially cause an unchecked epidemic either on Earth or in space so strict precautions are necessary. Each time a space vehicle visits another world it runs the risk of forever changing that extraterrestrial environment. We are surrounded on Earth by a mélange of different microorganisms, and if some of these hitchhike onboard a space mission, they could contaminate and start colonies on a different planet. Such an occurrence would irrevocably alter the nature of that world, compromise all future scientific exploration of the body, and possibly damage any extant life on it. By inadvertently carrying exotic organisms back to Earth on our spacecraft, we also risk the release of biohazardous materials into our own ecosystem. Such concerns were recognized by scientists even before the 1957 launch of Sputnik. This book presents the history of planetary protection by tracing the responses to the above concerns on NASA's missions to the Moon, Mars, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, and many smaller bodies of our solar system. The book relates the extensive efforts put forth by NASA to plan operations and prepare space vehicles that return exemplary science without contaminating the biospheres of other worlds or our own. To protect irreplaceable environments, NASA has committed to conducting space exploration in a manner that is protective of the bodies visited, as well as of our own planet.

T1  - Studies in Viral Ecology, Volume 2:&nbsp;Animal Host Systems
AN  - 2131381614
AB  - The most complete treatment available of virus ecology across kingdoms of host species 
Viruses are the most abundant organisms on the planet, occurring in every conceivable ecosystem. A growing part of the scientific community has come to view viruses as highly evolved biological entities with an organismal biology that is complex and interwoven with the biology of their hosting species. Studies in Viral Ecology, Volume II explains the ecology of viruses by examining their interactive dynamics with their animal hosts, including the types of transmission cycles that viruses have evolved encompassing principal and alternate hosts, vehicles, and vectoring species. Examining virology from an organismal biology approach, it focuses on the concept that viral infections represent areas of overlap in the ecologies of the involved species. 
Compiled by field expert Christon Hurst and featuring internationally recognized contributors, this volume begins with background information designed to bring readers to a common base of comprehension, defining viral ecology and the basic biology of viruses. Then, viruses with animal hosting species are discussed, including: 
 
 
Coral viruses  
 
Viruses infecting marine molluscs  
 
The viral ecology of aquatic crustaceans  
 
Viruses of fish  
 
Ecology of viruses infecting ectothermic vertebrates--the impact of ranavirus infections on amphibians  
 
Viruses of insects  
 
Viruses of terrestrial mammals  
 
Viruses of cetaceans  
 
The relationship between humans, their viruses, and prions  
 
Ecology of avian viruses   
This volume also helps readers understand how information gained from molecular techniques is used to comprehend these various aspects of virology. Additionally, this set of books contains information on the ecology of viroids and prions, which are molecularly related to and share common ecological aspects with the viruses. 
Studies in Viral Ecology, Volume II is essential for advanced undergraduate and graduate-level students studying viral ecology and environmental genomics. It also serves as an authoritative reference for professionals in the fields of virology, microbial ecology, infectious diseases, and disease transmission relative to humans, animals, and plants; this includes virologists, microbiologists, physicians, veterinarians, and agriculturalists.

AN  - 2135652180
AB  - Reviews of the First Edition 
"
Fish Cognition and Behavior is an essential read for anyone interested in fish welfare, psychology, sensory biology, neurobiology, conservation, and the application of pure research.''
 

--The Quarterly Review of Biology 

"Fish Cognition and Behavior ... will open the eyes of many readers to the importance of fish...in studying and understanding various aspects of animal cognition."
 

--Animal Behaviour 
"Insightful and fascinating questions are presented together with useful suggestions for future research directions on fish cognition... sufficiently entertaining to be read cover to cover."
 

--Fish and Fisheries 
"This is one of the best-edited and most valuable volumes I have encountered for those interested in the behavior of fish."
 

--Reviews in Fish Biology & Fisheries 
The study of animal cognition has until recently been largely confined to birds and mammals; a historical bias which has led to the belief that learning plays little or no part in the development of behavior in fishes and reptiles. Research in recent decades has begun to redress this misconception and it is now recognized that fishes exhibit a rich array of sophisticated behavior with impressive learning capabilities entirely comparable with those of mammals and other terrestrial animals. 
Building on the very well-received First Edition, and covering all major areas of fish learning, all chapters in this brand new edition of 
Fish Cognition and Behavior have been revised and updated by an internationally recognized team of contributing authors, with the addition of three brand new chapters, covering personality traits and behavior, lateralization of cognitive functions in fish, and cognition and welfare. 
This Second Edition of 
Fish Cognition and Behavior is essential reading for all fish biologists and ethologists, and contains much information of commercial importance for fisheries managers and aquaculture personnel. Libraries in all universities and research establishments where biological sciences, aquaculture and fisheries are studied and taught will find this book an extremely important addition to their shelves.

It identifies cities that have taken steps to become greener and discusses the strategies they have used; it also reviews broad concepts associated with green cities. Cities face enormous environmental challenges, and the entries in this volume, from case studies of greener cities to discussions of green urban design, infrastructure, and processes, can help us transform our cities into healthier, sustainable communities in which a growing urban population can thrive. Vivid photographs, searchable hyperlinks, numerous cross references, an extensive resource guide, and a clear, accessible writing style make the Green Society volumes ideal for classroom use as well as for research.

T1  - Artificial Reefs in Fisheries Management
AN  - 2131892773
AB  - While artificial reefs may have much to offer, they remain an anecdote in the greater scheme of fisheries management, primarily due to the lack of data specific to validating their use. Based on papers presented at the 9th Conference on Artificial Reefs and Artificial Habitats (CARAH) and also including original articles written for this reference, Artificial Reefs in Fisheries Management brings to the forefront the current state of knowledge regarding artificial reefs and their pragmatic application to furthering fisheries sustainability. It presents a timely compilation of research to increase options for the implementation of artificial reefs for fishery and natural resource managers. Artificial Reefs in Fisheries Management offers an inclusive and encompassing description of the field by chapter authors drawn from diverse geographical areas. This approach givesareaders the broadest of perspectives andareflects regional interests and experience with artificial reefs in different parts of the world. Coming at an opportune time in the field of artificial reefs, Artificial Reefs in Fisheries Management aidsaresearchers and natural resource managers more carefully consider the special features of artificial reefs in their application to resolving fisheries management problems. This book is an important step toward improving the prescribed useaof artificial reefs as a viable option in many of the worldOCOs fisheries in the quest to make more of the worldOCOs fisheries sustainable."

AN  - 868653945; 21437409
AB  - This study describes the accumulation of Hg and metallothionein gene expression in Litopenaeus vannamei Boone, 1931 with aquafeeds as the major source of Hg. Trials were conducted under controlled conditions in experimental tank facilities with high (indoor tanks) and low (outdoor tanks) Hg aquafeeds concentrations. Aquafeeds were the sole source of Hg for the shrimps and concentrations varied from 5.4 to 124 ng.g-1 d.w.. In the three animal fractions analysed; muscle (6,3 - 15,9 ng.g-1); hepatopancreas (5,1 - 22,0 ng.g-1) and exoskeleton (3,0 - 16,2 ng.g-1), Hg concentrations were significantly lower in the outdoor trials submitted to Hg-poor aquafeeds. Maximum shrimp muscle Hg concentrations were low (36.4 ng.g-1 w.w.) relative to maximum permissible concentrations for human consumption and Hg content in muscle and hepatopancreas were significantly correlated with Hg content in aquafeeds. Highest Hg concentrations in the exoskeleton of animals exposed to Hg-richer aquafeed, suggested that a detoxification mechanism is taking place. On the other hand the metallothionein suffered no variation in its relative expression in any of the experiments, meaning that the contact with feed containing the observed Hg concentrations were not sufficient to activate gene transcription. It was not possible, under the experimental design used, to infer Hg effects on the biological performance of the animals.

T1  - Compounds from Silicones Alter Enzyme Activity in Curing Barnacle Glue and Model Enzymes
AN  - 1296429483
AB  - Background  
Attachment strength of fouling organisms on silicone coatings is low. We hypothesized that low attachment strength on silicones is, in part, due to the interaction of surface available components with natural glues. Components could alter curing of glues through bulk changes or specifically through altered enzyme activity. 
 Methodology/Principal Findings  
GC-MS analysis of silicone coatings showed surface-available siloxanes when the coatings were gently rubbed with a cotton swab for 15 seconds or given a 30 second rinse with methanol. Mixtures of compounds were found on 2 commercial and 8 model silicone coatings. The hypothesis that silicone components alter glue curing enzymes was tested with curing barnacle glue and with commercial enzymes. In our model, barnacle glue curing involves trypsin-like serine protease(s), which activate enzymes and structural proteins, and a transglutaminase which cross-links glue proteins. Transglutaminase activity was significantly altered upon exposure of curing glue from individual barnacles to silicone eluates. Activity of purified trypsin and, to a greater extent, transglutaminase was significantly altered by relevant concentrations of silicone polymer constituents. 
 Conclusions/Significance  
Surface-associated silicone compounds can disrupt glue curing and alter enzyme properties. Altered curing of natural glues has potential in fouling management.

T1  - The watershed approach: Challenges, antecedents, and the transition from technical tool to governance unit
AN  - 1151964139
AB  - Watersheds are a widely accepted scale for water governance activities. This paper makes three contributions to current understandings of watersheds as governance units. First, the paper collects recent research identifying some of the challenges associated with the policy framework understood as the watershed approach. These challenges are boundary choice, accountability, public participation, and watersheds' asymmetries with 'problem-sheds' and 'policy-sheds'. Second, the paper draws upon this synthesis and on a review of the development and evolution of the concept of watersheds to suggest that the challenges associated with the watershed approach are symptoms of a broader issue: that the concept of watersheds was developed as a technical tool but has been taken up as a policy framework. The result of this transition from tool to framework, the paper argues, has been the conflation of governance tools, hydrologic boundaries, and Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). Third, the paper calls for an analysis of watersheds as separate from the governance tools with which they have been conflated, and presents three entry points into such an analysis.

T1  - Biological Diversity:&nbsp;Frontiers in Measurement and Assessment
AN  - 2131922478
AB  - Biological Diversity provides an up-to-date, authoritative review of the methods of measuring and assessing biological diversity, together with their application. The book's emphasis is on quantifying the variety, abundance, and occurrence of taxa, and on providing objective and clear guidance for both scientists and managers. This is a fast-moving field and one that is the focus of intense research interest. However the rapid development of new methods, the inconsistent and sometimes confusing application of old ones, and the lack of consensus in the literature about the best approach, means that there is a real need for a current synthesis. Biological Diversity covers fundamental measurement issues such as sampling, re-examines familiar diversity metrics (including species richness, diversity statistics, and estimates of spatial and temporal turnover), discusses species abundance distributions and how best to fit them, explores species occurrence and the spatial structure of biodiversity, and investigates alternative approaches used to assess trait, phylogenetic, and genetic diversity. The final section of the book turns to a selection of contemporary challenges such as measuring microbial diversity, evaluating the impact of disturbance, assessing biodiversity in managed landscapes, measuring diversity in the imperfect fossil record, and using species density estimates in management and conservation.

T1  - OPG hopes net will stop fish from swimming into nuclear plant
AN  - 528032537
AB  - The CNSC has also asked OPG to reduce the loss of fish eggs and larva due to the intake by 60 per cent. To make up for that, OPG will look at a stocking program and a fish habitat restoration program. The company is working with the local conservation authority and in the past, OPG has spent millions on habitat restoration projects across Ontario.

              
Ultimately, if the net doesn't work, Ms. Le said OPG will try the next best technology, but she expects OPG will be able to meet the CNSC's targets. The Darlington plant is newer and has a different intake design which draws water from a greater depth in the lake and does not have an issue with fish being drawn into the plant.

T1  - The Mediterranean Region:&nbsp;Biological Diversity in Space and Time
AN  - 2132057400
AB  - It is becoming clear that the Mediterranean region is one of the hottest of the biodiversity hotspots on the planet. There is also an increasing concern for the conservation, adaptive management, and restoration of the unique natural ecosystems and cultural landscapes that characterize this area. The region's biological and cultural heritage as well as its huge wealth of biodiversity is now at real risk. This brings a further urgency to the task of communicating detailed butreadily accessible information on the Mediterranean biota, and an ecological, historical and evolutionary perspective to the changing contexts in which the region's flora and fauna continue to evolve. There is no other recent textbook devoted solely to Mediterranean evolutionary ecology, and a synthesis of the many recent advances is now overdue. This new work builds on the success and reputation of the first edition, although the text has been updated and expanded to document recent changes to biodiversity, new ecological and evolutionary insights, and the challenges for the future. These changes include the addition of two new chapters devoted to the Mediterranean Sea itself, andespecially the coastal areas. Throughout the book, the pressing issues of global change (especially climate warming) are addressed, in conjunction with changing land use, and in terms of their potential impact on biota, communities, ecosystems, and landscapes.

T1  - Impact of Marine Drugs on Cytoskeleton-Mediated Reproductive Events
AN  - 1536071274
AB  - Marine organisms represent an important source of novel bioactive compounds, often showing unique modes of action. Such drugs may be useful tools to study complex processes such as reproduction; which is characterized by many crucial steps that start at gamete maturation and activation and virtually end at the first developmental stages. During these processes cytoskeletal elements such as microfilaments and microtubules play a key-role. In this review we describe: (i) the involvement of such structures in both cellular and in vitro processes; (ii) the toxins that target the cytoskeletal elements and dynamics; (iii) the main steps of reproduction and the marine drugs that interfere with these cytoskeleton-mediated processes. We show that marine drugs, acting on microfilaments and microtubules, exert a wide range of impacts on reproductive events including sperm maturation and motility, oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryo development.

T1  - Molecular phylogeny of pearl oysters and their relatives (Mollusca, Bivalvia, Pterioidea)
AN  - 901958595; 21059254
AB  - Abstract              Background: The superfamily Pterioidea is a morphologically and ecologically diverse lineage of epifaunal marine bivalves distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical continental shelf regions. This group includes commercially important pearl culture species and model organisms used for medical studies of biomineralization. Recent morphological treatment of selected pterioideans and molecular phylogenetic analyses of higher-level relationships in Bivalvia have challenged the traditional view that pterioidean families are monophyletic. This issue is examined here in light of molecular data sets composed of DNA sequences for nuclear and mitochondrial loci, and a published character data set of anatomical and shell morphological characters.              Results: The present study is the first comprehensive species-level analysis of the Pterioidea to produce a well-resolved, robust phylogenetic hypothesis for nearly all extant taxa. The data were analyzed for potential biases due to taxon and character sampling, and idiosyncracies of different molecular evolutionary processes. The congruence and contribution of different partitions were quantified, and the sensitivity of clade stability to alignment parameters was explored.              Conclusions: Four primary conclusions were reached: (1) the results strongly supported the monophyly of the Pterioidea; (2) none of the previously defined families (except for the monotypic Pulvinitidae) were monophyletic; (3) the arrangement of the genera was novel and unanticipated, however strongly supported and robust to changes in alignment parameters; and (4) optimizing key morphological characters onto topologies derived from the analysis of molecular data revealed many instances of homoplasy and uncovered synapomorphies for major nodes. Additionally, a complete species-level sampling of the genus Pinctada  provided further insights into the on-going controversy regarding the taxonomic identity of major pearl culture species.

T1  - Molecular phylogeny of pearl oysters and their relatives (Mollusca, Bivalvia, Pterioidea)
AN  - 2955179953
AB  - Background 
The superfamily Pterioidea is a morphologically and ecologically diverse lineage of epifaunal marine bivalves distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical continental shelf regions. This group includes commercially important pearl culture species and model organisms used for medical studies of biomineralization. Recent morphological treatment of selected pterioideans and molecular phylogenetic analyses of higher-level relationships in Bivalvia have challenged the traditional view that pterioidean families are monophyletic. This issue is examined here in light of molecular data sets composed of DNA sequences for nuclear and mitochondrial loci, and a published character data set of anatomical and shell morphological characters.
 Results 
The present study is the first comprehensive species-level analysis of the Pterioidea to produce a well-resolved, robust phylogenetic hypothesis for nearly all extant taxa. The data were analyzed for potential biases due to taxon and character sampling, and idiosyncracies of different molecular evolutionary processes. The congruence and contribution of different partitions were quantified, and the sensitivity of clade stability to alignment parameters was explored.
 Conclusions 
Four primary conclusions were reached: (1) the results strongly supported the monophyly of the Pterioidea; (2) none of the previously defined families (except for the monotypic Pulvinitidae) were monophyletic; (3) the arrangement of the genera was novel and unanticipated, however strongly supported and robust to changes in alignment parameters; and (4) optimizing key morphological characters onto topologies derived from the analysis of molecular data revealed many instances of homoplasy and uncovered synapomorphies for major nodes. Additionally, a complete species-level sampling of the genus Pinctada provided further insights into the on-going controversy regarding the taxonomic identity of major pearl culture species.

T1  - Molecular Mechanisms of Microcystin Toxicity in Animal Cells
AN  - 1526141731
AB  - Microcystins (MC) are potent hepatotoxins produced by the cyanobacteria of the genera Planktothrix, Microcystis, Aphanizomenon, Nostoc and Anabaena. These cyclic heptapeptides have strong affinity to serine/threonine protein phosphatases (PPs) thereby acting as an inhibitor of this group of enzymes. Through this interaction a cascade of events responsible for the MC cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in animal cells may take place. Moreover MC induces oxidative stress in animal cells and together with the inhibition of PPs, this pathway is considered to be one of the main mechanisms of MC toxicity. In recent years new insights on the key enzymes involved in the signal-transduction and toxicity have been reported demonstrating the complexity of the interaction of these toxins with animal cells. Key proteins involved in MC up-take, biotransformation and excretion have been identified, demonstrating the ability of aquatic animals to metabolize and excrete the toxin. MC have shown to interact with the mitochondria. The consequences are the dysfunction of the organelle, induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell apoptosis. MC activity leads to the differential expression/activity of transcriptional factors and protein kinases involved in the pathways of cellular differentiation, proliferation and tumor promotion activity. This activity may result from the direct inhibition of the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A. This review aims to summarize the increasing data regarding the molecular mechanisms of MC toxicity in animal systems, reporting for direct MC interacting proteins and key enzymes in the process of toxicity biotransformation/excretion of these cyclic peptides.

AN  - 2132039609
AB  - Distinguished linguistics scholar Anatoly Liberman set out the frame for this volume in An Analytic Dictionary of English Etymology. Here, Liberman's landmark scholarship lay the groundwork for his forthcoming multivolume analytic dictionary of the English language. A Bibliography of English Etymology is a broadly conceptualized reference tool that provides source materials for etymological research. For each word's etymology, there is a bibliographic entry that lists the word origin's primary sources, specifically, where it was first found in use. Featuring the history of more than 13,000 English words, their cognates, and their foreign antonyms, this is a full-fledged compendium of resources indispensable to any scholar of word origins.

T1  - Marine Phytoplankton
AN  - 2131253279
AB  - Phytoplankton are microscopic plants that live in the ocean. Phytoplankton obtain energy through a process called photosynthesis and must therefore live in the well-lit surface layer of an ocean, sea, lake or other body of water. Through photosynthesis, phytoplankton are responsible for much of the oxygen present in the Earth's atmosphere – half of the total amount produced by all plant life. They are also the basis for the oceanic food chain. Since phytoplankton depend upon certain conditions for growth, they are a good indicator of change in their environment. For these reasons, and because they also exert a global-scale influence on climate, phytoplankton are of primary interest to oceanographers and Earth scientists around the world. This book provides current research on this very important marine plant species. The increasing numbers of entrepreneurs who are exploring and investing in marine phytoplankton as sources of food additives, pharmaceutics, therapeutics and bioenergy are discussed as well.

T1  - Global Issues in Water, Sanitation, and Health:&nbsp;Workshop Summary
AN  - 2131795281
AB  - As the human population grows--tripling in the past century while, simultaneously, quadrupling its demand for water--Earth's finite freshwater supplies are increasingly strained, and also increasingly contaminated by domestic, agricultural, and industrial wastes. Today, approximately one-third of the world's population lives in areas with scarce water resources. Nearly one billion people currently lack access to an adequate water supply, and more than twice as many lack access to basic sanitation services. It is projected that by 2025 water scarcity will affect nearly two-thirds of all people on the planet. Recognizing that water availability, water quality, and sanitation are fundamental issues underlying infectious disease emergence and spread, the Institute of Medicine held a two-day public workshop, summarized in this volume. Through invited presentations and discussions, participants explored global and local connections between water, sanitation, and health; the spectrum of water-related disease transmission processes as they inform intervention design; lessons learned from water-related disease outbreaks; vulnerabilities in water and sanitation infrastructure in both industrialized and developing countries; and opportunities to improve water and sanitation infrastructure so as to reduce the risk of water-related infectious disease.

T1  - Changing Climates in North American Politics:&nbsp;Institutions, Policymaking, and Multilevel Governance
AN  - 2131064292
AB  - Analysis of climate change policy innovations across North America at transnational, federal, state, and local levels, involving public, private, and civic actors. 
North American policy responses to global climate change are complex and sometimes contradictory and reach across multiple levels of government. For example, the U.S. federal government rejected the Kyoto Protocol and mandatory greenhouse gas (GHG) restrictions, but California developed some of the world's most comprehensive climate change law and regulation; Canada's federal government ratified the Kyoto Protocol, but Canadian GHG emissions increased even faster than those of the United States; and Mexico's state-owned oil company addressed climate change issues in the 1990s, in stark contrast to leading U.S. and Canadian energy firms. This book is the first to examine and compare political action for climate change across North America, at levels ranging from continental to municipal, in locations ranging from Mexico to Toronto to Portland, Maine. 
Changing Climates in North American Politics investigates new or emerging institutions, policies, and practices in North American climate governance; the roles played by public, private, and civil society actors; the diffusion of policy across different jurisdictions; and the effectiveness of multilevel North American climate change governance. It finds that although national climate policies vary widely, the complexities and divergences are even greater at the subnational level. Policy initiatives are developed separately in states, provinces, cities, large corporations, NAFTA bodies, universities, NGOs, and private firms, and this lack of coordination limits the effectiveness of multilevel climate change governance. In North America, unlike much of Europe, climate change governance has been largely bottom-up rather than top-down.

T1  - The Physical Geography of the Mediterranean
AN  - 2131064559
AB  - This volume explores the climates, landscapes, ecosystems and hazards that comprise the Mediterranean world. It traces the development of the Mediterranean landscape over very long timescales and examines modern processes and key environmental issues in a wide range of settings. The Mediterranean is the only region on Earth where three continents meet and this interaction has produced a very distinctive Physical Geography. This book examines the landscapes and processes at themargins of these continents and the distinctive marine environment between them. Catastrophic earthquakes, explosive volcanic eruptions and devastating storms and floods are intimately bound up within the history and mythology of the Mediterranean world. This is a key region for the study of naturalhazards because it offers unrivalled access to long records of hazard occurrence and impact through documentary, archaeological and geological archives. The Mediterranean is also a biodiversity hotspot; it has been a meeting place for plants, animals and humans from three continents throughout much of its history. The Quaternary records of these interactions are more varied and better preserved than in any other part of the world. These records have provided important new insights into thetempo of climate, landscape and ecosystem change in the Mediterranean region and beyond. The region is unique because of the very early and widespread impact of humans in landscape and ecosystem change - and the richness of the archaeological and geological archives that chronicle this impact. This bookexamines this history and these interactions and places current environmental issues in long term context.

T1  - Environmental Flows in Water Resources Policies, Plans, and Projects:&nbsp;Findings and Recommendations
AN  - 2131283783
AB  - This book advances the understanding and integration in operational terms of environmental flows (water allocation) into integrated water resources management (IWRM). Based on an in-depth analysis of 17 global water policy, plan, and project case studies, it addresses the highly contested complexities of environmentally responsible water resources development, broadens the global perspectives on equitable sharing and sustainable use of water resources, and expands the definitions of benefits sharing in high-risk water resources development. The book fills a major gap in knowledge on IWRM and forms an important contribution to the ongoing discourse on climate change adaptation in the water sector.

T1  - Safe Management of Shellfish and Harvest Waters:&nbsp;Minimizing Health Risks from Sewage-contaminated Shellfish
AN  - 2131254005
AB  - "Developed from an expert workshop convened by the World Health Organization and US Environmental Protection Agency, Safe Management of Shellfish and Harvest Waters provides a thorough review of the issues surrounding public health concerns associated with shellfish consumption. The trade and consumption of bivalve shellfish is a global industry and is increasing. Human illness caused by infectious agents transmitted through animal or human sources through shellfish consumption has been recognized for many years. It addresses contaminant sources and means of transmission to bivalve shellfish and where possible, identifies options to interrupt the cycle. The efficacy of current practices is discussed with the aid of case studies written by practitioners working in the field from a number of developed and developing countries. The need for the deployment of new approaches to protect human health from infectious diseases associated with the consumption of contaminated bivalve shellfish is discussed, focusing specifically on water management aspects and strategies. It provides valuable information on the real health risks posed by shellfish consumption. It distills worldwide experience; identifies the challenges and opportunities that face the industry and suggests responses to those challenges. It provides the scientific basis for regulation and associated monitoring and risk reduction programmes to enable health agencies, water quality and shellfish regulatory agencies and other stakeholders worldwide to control and reduce the existing and potential future infectious disease problems through better management of shellfish waters."--Publisher's description.

T1  - In the Light of Evolution:&nbsp;Volume II: Biodiversity and Extinction
AN  - 2135891032
AB  - The current extinction crisis is of human making, and any favorable resolution of that biodiversity crisis--among the most dire in the 4-billion-year history of Earth--will have to be initiated by mankind. Little time remains for the public, corporations, and governments to awaken to the magnitude of what is at stake. This book aims to assist that critical educational mission, synthesizing recent scientific information and ideas about threats to biodiversity in the past, present, and projected future.
 This is the second volume from the In the Light of Evolution series, based on a series of Arthur M. Sackler colloquia, and designed to promote the evolutionary sciences. Each installment explores evolutionary perspectives on a particular biological topic that is scientifically intriguing but also has special relevance to contemporary societal issues or challenges. Individually and collectively, the ILE series aims to interpret phenomena in various areas of biology through the lens of evolution, address some of the most intellectually engaging as well as pragmatically important societal issues of our times, and foster a greater appreciation of evolutionary biology as a consolidating foundation for the life sciences.

T1  - Bullhead Queen:&nbsp;A Year on Pioneer Lake
AN  - 2131894850
AB  - The Western approach to nature has always operated under both spiritual and scientific views. While Christianity decrees that human beings have dominion over nature, evolutionary biology teaches us that we are but highly adapted animals among a biological network of millions of other species. What is our proper relationship to wild animalsand what is our responsibility to them? In The Bullhead Queen, Sue Leaf exemplifies the moral aspect of humans to nature through a collection of engaging meditations on the places she sees every day on Pioneer Lake in east-central Minnesota. Reflecting on the birds she peers at through binoculars and the Lutheran church that anchors the lakes southern shore, Leaf contemplates how her relationship to nature has been colored by the Christian theology of her childhood. Acknowledging the influence of the church on her view of the natural world, she follows the liturgical calendar as a thread, chronicling the change of seasons over the year.Leaf considers the results of the assumption that nature is ours to use: we continue to fish, trap, and hunt animals whose populations are ghosts of their former selves and produce mounting environmental pressures on their habitats. Observing the ways in which the heavy hand of human beings has changed the landscape of Pioneer Lake, and many others like it, she also rejoices in the ways in which the lakes remain wild and exuberant, influencing the lives of all who encounter them.

T1  - Resource Allocation Theory Applied to Farm Animal Production
AN  - 2132095855
AB  - According to the Resource Allocation Theory, an individual's genetic potential can only be realized in an environment in which essential food resources are adequately supplied. This book describes resource allocation patterns in natural populations, the costs, preferences and trade-offs of maintenance, growth, reproduction and immune function, the consequences of selection for high production efficiency in livestock species, methods that can be used to quantify resource allocation patterns, and the application of resource allocation theory to improve animal production and wellbeing.

T1  - Pharma-Ecology:&nbsp;The Occurrence and Fate of Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products in the Environment
AN  - 2131982765
AB  - Pharmaceuticals and personal care products--we can't live without them. Can the environment survive with them? Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are increasingly being recognized as micropollutants. In this context, pharmaceutical products encompass a diverse range of drugs used to treat various illnesses, and personal care products include everyday items such as soaps, fragrances, cleaning agents, disinfectants, and similar products. Written for professionals from different backgrounds, Pharma-Ecology bridges the knowledge and language gap and critically examines the issue of PPCP micropollutants and how to best minimize their impact on the environment. Organized systematically, it: Presents a range of pharmaceutical compounds categorized by mode of action and common usage, displaying the volumes (or number of prescriptions) that are dispersed Discusses the detection of PPCPs in the environment using instrumentation and bioassay techniques, including microarrays Covers the occurrences of PPCPs in aquatic systems, sediments, soil, and aerial environments Considers the persistence and degradation of PPCPs in the environment, and links pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics with the kinetics of PPCPs in the environment Explores engineering and treatment techniques that could minimize the impact of PPCPs in the environment Includes numerous tables and figures that illustrate information This is an enlightening reference for engineers, toxicologists, ecologists, micro-biologists, and chemists involved in pollution and environmental analysis; policy-makers; professionals in federal and state regulatory agencies; and pharmaceutical professionals. It is also an excellent text for undergraduate and graduate students in related fields.

T1  - Global Catastrophes and Trends:&nbsp;The Next Fifty Years
AN  - 2131827821
AB  - A wide-ranging, interdisciplinary look at global changes that may occur over the next fifty years--whether sudden and cataclysmic world-changing events or gradually unfolding trends. 
Fundamental change occurs most often in one of two ways: as a "fatal discontinuity," a sudden catastrophic event that is potentially world changing, or as a persistent, gradual trend. Global catastrophes include volcanic eruptions, viral pandemics, wars, and large-scale terrorist attacks; trends are demographic, environmental, economic, and political shifts that unfold over time. In this provocative book, scientist Vaclav Smil takes a wide-ranging, interdisciplinary look at the catastrophes and trends the next fifty years may bring. 
Smil first looks at rare but cataclysmic events, both natural and human-produced, then at trends of global importance, including the transition from fossil fuels to other energy sources and growing economic and social inequality. He also considers environmental change--in some ways an amalgam of sudden discontinuities and gradual change--and assesses the often misunderstood complexities of global warming. 

Global Catastrophes and Trends does not come down on the side of either doom-and-gloom scenarios or techno-euphoria. Instead, Smil argues that understanding change will help us reverse negative trends and minimize the risk of catastrophe.

AN  - 2131967197
AB  - Industrial waste is a type of waste produced by industrial activity, such as that of factories, mills and mines. It has existed since the outset of the industrial revolution. Much industrial waste is neither hazardous nor toxic, such as waste fiber produced by agriculture and logging. Toxic waste and chemical waste are two designations of industrial waste. Sewage treatment can be used to clean water tainted with industrial waste. This volume presents new research in this growing field.

Environment Minister John Baird laid the blame squarely on the former Liberal government.                "They did little or nothing to fix those problems," Baird said.

T1  - Erie, noir; Margaret Atwood gazes into her beloved Great Lake, from the perspective of Point Pelee, and sees nothing but chemical darkness. We need this water to drink. Is that too hard for politicians to understand?: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 439371208
AB  - Despite its usually sunny skies and its innocent aquamarine hue, Lake Erie does have something noir about it. Of all the Great Lakes, it's had the most shipwrecks, due to its wickedly shifting sandbars. Also, the western end of Lake Erie is the thunderstorm capital of Canada - the lightning displays are breathtaking, the winds can hit gale force, and, due to the lake's shallowness, the waves build very quickly. But despite these boating hazards, a great deal of alcohol crossed Erie during Prohibition. Mobster corpses were frequently dumped into the Detroit River, to wash up on the beaches of Pelee Island, where a special ice house was built to accommodate them.                 Phragmites, that tall reed with the graceful plumes that gives nothing back to native ecosystems, has started to clog up important Pelee Island wetlands. The Carolinian woodlands on Pelee are being threatened by the same killer garlic mustard invasion that's menacing the rest of Ontario's hardwood stands, choking out the native plants and killing trees by poisoning their root systems. All of these pests have reached menacing proportions in only the last 25 years - about the time we've been on Pelee Island. It's not just change that's so disturbing, it's the rapidity with which negative change is now taking place.                 Human beings will keep on saying, "It's not too late" until the very last gasp. It's our nature Hope's built in. And hope's not always unjustified Environments can be repaired; water can be cleansed; and species populations can recover, unless, of course, the species goes extinct first. So, ever hopeful, we'll beaver away at garlic mustard elimination and habitat preservation and so forth, and continue to push for change, while remaining fully aware that of all charitable giving, 97 per cent goes to human causes, and of the remaining 3 per cent, 11/2 per cent goes to pet animals. That leaves only 11/2 per cent for the non-human part of the planet that supports all life, including us.

T1  - U.S. considers tough rules to stem tide of 'invasives': [ONT Edition]
AN  - 439369207
AB  - "These new, tougher ballast water regulations will protect the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway ecosystem and permit vital marine commerce to flourish," said Collister Johnson Jr., administrator of the U.S. St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corp.                Critics say those ships - known as NOBOBs (no ballast on board) - might have residue in their tanks harbouring living organisms. More than 90 per cent of the freighters entering the St. Lawrence Seaway are NOBOBs, the 2007 study said.

T1  - Evolution Through Genetic Exchange
AN  - 2131854819
AB  - More and more data indicate that evolution has resulted in lineages consisting of mosaics of genes derived from different ancestors. It is therefore becoming increasingly clear that the tree is an inadequate metaphor of evolutionary change. In this book, Arnold promotes the 'web-of-life' metaphor as a more appropriate representation of evolutionary change in all lifeforms. -;Even before the publication of Darwin's Origin of Species, the perception of evolutionary change has been a tree-like pattern of diversification - with divergent branches spreading further and further from the trunk. In the only illustration of Darwin's treatise, branches large and small never reconnect. However, it is now evident that this view does not adequately encompass the richness of evolutionary pattern and process. Instead, the evolution of species from microbes to. mammals builds like a web that crosses and re-crosses through genetic exchange, even as it grows outward from a point of origin. Some of the avenues for genetic exchange, for example introgression through sexual recombination versus lateral gene transfer mediated by transposable elements, are based on. definably different molecular mechanisms. However, even such widely different genetic processes may result in similar effects on adaptations (either new or transferred), genome evolution, population genetics, and the evolutionary/ecological trajectory of organisms. For example, the evolution of novel adaptations (resulting from lateral gene transfer) leading to the flea-borne, deadly, causative agent of plague from a rarely-fatal, orally-transmitted, bacterial species is quite similar to the. adaptations accrued from natural hybridization between annual sunflower species resulting in the formation of several new species. Thus, more and more data indicate that evolution has resulted in lineages consisting of mosaics of genes derived from different ancestors. It is therefore becoming. increasingly clear that the tree is an inadequate metaphor of evolutionary change. In this book, Arnold promotes the 'web-of-life' metaphor as a more appropriate representation of evolutionary change in all lifeforms. This research level text is suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate level students taking related courses in departments of genetics, ecology and evolution. It will also be of relevance and use to professional evolutionary biologists and systematists seeking a comprehensive and authoritative overview of this rapidly expanding field. -;Evolution Through Genetic Exchange represents a compelling argument for a paradigm shift in evolutionary biology, in which the Tree of Life is replaced conceptually by a Web of Life that connects all living organisms and their genomes.

AN  - 434567729
AB  - "They say you need a crisis before people get jerked into taking responsible action," says Chandra Madramootoo, a water researcher and founding director of McGill University's Brace Centre for Water Resources Management. "When are we going to finally say 'Jeez, we're not as water rich as we thought we were and maybe we better start doing something?' Is it going to be the day when we (must) ration water?"                 "There's an opportunity to find new water supplies without piping it in from somewhere - finding new water supplies from conservation," said the Sierra Club's Morris. "You save money on infrastructure, you save on energy use from pumping and treating water."                 "We have this tendency to just turn on our taps and think, 'Well, there's an endless supply there,'" said [Tim Morris] of the Sierra Club. "But it's coming from somewhere and it's having an impact. Our water resources are not infinite and they do have a point where they're going to end up in trouble unless we do a better job of stewarding them."

T1  - Climate Change and Cultural Dynamics:&nbsp;A Global Perspective on Mid-Holocene Transitions
AN  - 2131105149
AB  - The Middle Holocene epoch (8,000 to 3,000 years ago) was a time of dramatic changes in the physical world and in human cultures. Across this span, climatic conditions changed rapidly, with cooling in the high to mid-latitudes and drying in the tropics. In many parts of the world, human groups became more complex, with early horticultural systems replaced by intensive agriculture and small-scale societies being replaced by larger, more hierarchial organizations. 
Climate Change and Cultural Dynamics explores the cause and effect relationship between climatic change and cultural transformations across the mid-Holocene (c. 4000 B.C.). 
 
Explores the role of climatic change on the development of society around the world 
Chapters detail diverse geographical regions 
Co-written by noted archaeologists and paleoclimatologists for non-specialists

T1  - The Fish Oocyte:&nbsp;From Basic Studies to Biotechnological Applications
AN  - 2131296604
AB  - This book addresses the growing needs in deciphering the biological processes associated with fish reproduction, in view of the growth of aquaculture and the dwindling natural stocks of commercially important fish. It presents a comprehensive overview on egg production in fish, from the standpoint of the oocyte. With this view in mind, the book includes chapters on oocyte development (oogenesis), hormonal regulation and hormone receptors, formation of the egg envelopes, growth, accumulation of nutrients and maternal transcripts, maturation, hydration, ovulation and fertilization. A special emphasis is placed on using state-of-the-art tools including electron microscopy for discerning the ultra-structure of the follicle and genomic/proteomic tools to fully understand biological basis of fish reproduction. Studies on promoting oocyte maturation, ovulation and spawning in farmed fish and preservation of fish oocytes at low temperatures are also included. 
The book will appeal to University lecturers, students, research scientists and those associated with culture of fish in freshwater or marine aquaculture.Discusses oocyte development, maturation, hydration and fertilization

T1  - Ecological Understanding:&nbsp;The Nature of Theory and the Theory of Nature
AN  - 2131230602
AB  - This widely anticipated revision of the groundbreaking book, Ecological Understanding, updates this crucial sourcebook of contemporary philosophical insights for practicing ecologists and graduate students in ecology and environmental studies. The second edition contains new ecological examples, an expanded array of conceptual diagrams and illustrations, new text boxes summarizing important points or defining key terms, and new reference to philosophical issues and controversies. Although the first edition was recognized for its clarity, this revision takes the opportunity to make the exposition of complex topics still clearer to readers without a philosophical background. Readers will gain an understanding of the goals of science, the structure of theory, the kinds of theory relevant to ecology, the way that theory changes, what constitutes objectivity in contemporary science, and the role of paradigms and frameworks for synthesis within ecology and in integration with other disciplines. Finally, how theory can inform and anchor the public use of ecological knowledge in civic debates is laid out. This new edition refines the understanding of how the structure and change of theory can improve the growth and application of one of the 21st centuryOCOs key sciences. AExplains the philosophical basis of ecology in plain English AContains chapter overviews and summaries AText boxes highlight key points, examples, or controversies ADiagrams explain structure and development of theory, and integration AEvaluates and relates paradgims in ecology AIllustrates philosophical issues with classic and new ecological research"

T1  - Environmental Problem Solving:&nbsp;A How-To Guide
AN  - 2131396785
AB  - As environmental problems become increasingly complex, it is critical that students and activists learn the skills with which to address them. Although there already are many case studies of actual issues, only in the last few years have environmental scientists paid close attention to their resolution. Environmental Problem Solving teaches these skills. 

Jeffrey W. Hughes creates an organized method for approaching problems, understanding larger issues, and crafting solutions to a wide range of contemporary environmental issues. Many environmental activists often have preconceived ideas of environmental protection and problem solving. They react emotionally to news of deforestation, a new housing development, or a planned big-box store without thinking about the problem logically, and they may automatically regard foresters, development companies, and corporations as opponents. As their views harden, discourse turns acrimonious, and it becomes ever more difficult to find satisfactory solutions.

This book teaches those on both sides of the table to address their own preconceptions and approach hard issues critically, methodically, and fairly. Hughes combines aspects of the decision-making process from the fields of business, management, and communication science based on extensive research and ample practical experience in the field and classroom. He creates a logical framework to help guide thinking from identifying a problem to finding its solution. Using examples drawn from real-life situations, Environmental Problem Solving will become an invaluable guide for environmentalists, agency professionals, consultants, students, naturalists, and concerned citizens.

T1  - Eutrophication of Shallow Lakes with Special Reference to Lake Taihu, China
AN  - 2132067434
AB  - Eutrophication and algal blooms are worldwide environmental issues in lakes. The eutrophication process and formation mechanisms of algal blooms are particularly complicated in shallow lakes due to the strong lake-land, air-water and water-sediment interactions. This volume features papers presented at the International Symposium on the Eutrophication Process and Control in Large Shallow Lakes - with Special Reference to Lake Taihu, a Shallow Subtropical Chinese Lake, held in Nanjing, China, 22-26 April, 2005. The topics include: physical processes and their effects on shallow lake ecosystems; biogeochemistry of sediments and nutrient cycling in shallow lakes; algal blooms and ecosystem response in shallow lakes; eutrophication control and restoration in shallow lakes; and resource exploitation, environmental protection and sustainable management in shallow lakes. 
This volume will make a significant contribution to the understanding and management of eutrophication in shallow lakes.Describes eutrophication of shallow lakes

T1  - Out of the Blue:&nbsp;Public Interpretation of Maritime Cultural Resources
AN  - 2131159576
AB  - The spectacle of archaeology stirs the public interest like few other topics. Sowing the "detective story", finding the missing pieces of the puzzle, understanding an instilled sense of identity, making connections to the material culture, following the global discourse on heritage protection and conservation (i.e. the Elgin Marbles) - are all part of the nexus of cultural values that define the meaning of archaeology to individuals and to the public at large. 
Along with the debates archaeological sites are also often in view of the public - on land, as well as, underwater. Maritime cultural resources encompass sites that, because of their (often) proximity to urban or traveled areas (harbors, rivers, ports) are easily damaged but not easily visible. This leads to special challenges to site management regarding conservation, protection, and enforcement of legal mandates for public education outreach and interpretation. 
The editors have brought together state of the art ideas, research and scholarship associated with maritime public education and interpretation. With few publications currently available that feature the public interpretation of maritime and submerged cultural resources, this edited volume will add to a limited body of knowledge in a field that is steadily growing.
Many archaeologists - both academic and professional - work with sites that are open or in view of the public 
While there are several books in the field of preservation and heritage protection for terrestrial archaeology, there are very few resources for archaeologists working with maritime and submerged cultural heritage 
This book is a collection of ideas, research and scholarship associated with maritime education and interpretation

T1  - Biological Emergences:&nbsp;Evolution by Natural Experiment
AN  - 2131435103
AB  - Natural selection is commonly interpreted as the fundamental mechanism of evolution. Questions about how selection theory can claim to be the all-sufficient explanation of evolution often go unanswered by today's neo-Darwinists, perhaps for fear that any criticism of the evolutionary paradigm will encourage creationists and proponents of intelligent design.In Biological Emergences, Robert Reid argues that natural selection is not the cause of evolution. He writes that the causes of variations, which he refers to as natural experiments, are independent of natural selection; indeed, he suggests, natural selection may get in the way of evolution. Reid proposes an alternative theory to explain how emergent novelties are generated and under what conditions they can overcome the resistance of natural selection. He suggests that what causes innovative variation causes evolution, and that these phenomena are environmental as well as organismal.After an extended critique of selectionism, Reid constructs an emergence theory of evolution, first examining the evidence in three causal arenas of emergent evolution: symbiosis/association, evolutionary physiology/behavior, and developmental evolution. Based on this evidence of causation, he proposes some working hypotheses, examining mechanisms and processes common to all three arenas, and arrives at a theoretical framework that accounts for generative mechanisms and emergent qualities. Without selectionism, Reid argues, evolutionary innovation can more easily be integrated into a general thesis. Finally, Reid proposes a biological synthesis of rapid emergent evolutionary phases and the prolonged, dynamically stable, non-evolutionary phases imposed by natural selection.

T1  - Towards an integrated approach to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity: lessons learned from the Rideau River biodiversity project
AN  - 1682466824
AB  - In the quest to conserve global biological resources there has been a growing recognition that conventional scientific methods and institutional arrangements are not always effective in dealing with the biophysical complexities and sociopolitical dimensions of biodiversity issues. Meeting these challenges requires an integrated approach that combines scientific methods with societal values. Community-based research promotes social change, by building the capacity of communities to find collective and culturally appropriate ways to achieve sustainable development on their own terms. Ecosystem management recognizes the interconnectedness of social and ecological systems and attempts to link science, policy and societal goals through interdisciplinary research and multistakeholder decision-making. In 1998, the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, Canada, in partnership with government agencies, educational institutions and community groups began a three-year multidisciplinary study of the ecosystem health of the Rideau River in eastern Ontario, Canada. This paper presents the Rideau River Biodiversity Project as a case study in the application of an integrated approach to assess the biodiversity of an aquatic ecosystem. Ultimately, we present a framework for an integrated approach to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity that combines the strengths of community-based research and ecosystem management through a process of social learning and transdisciplinary inquiry.

T1  - Life As We Know It
AN  - 2135526231
AB  - Life As we Know It ["LAKI"] covers several aspects of Life, ranging from the prebiotic level, origin of life, evolution of prokaryotes to eukaryotes and finally to various affairs of human beings. Although it is hard to define Life, one can, however, characterize it and describe its features. Topics treated are categories of bacteria, algae and fungi, conscience, philosophy, theology, aesthetics, appearance of sport and life destiny, life after clinical death, and thoughts of the world to come ("Olam Haba"). 
The various chapters have been written so that they are accessible to all - from the avid lay reader to the specialist - and make available multidisciplinary sources of information about Life. This volume will interest open minded scholars, students at all levels of general sciences, natural and Life science, researchers of philosophy, theology, history of Life, astrobiology, and those who wish to widen their knowledge about "who are we in the universe". 
The information presented here on the various phenomena of Life were all written by highly qualified authors including scientists, public leaders, a professional athelete and three Nobel Laureates.
Topical book covering all aspects of, and offering multidisciplinary sources of information about Life 
Compiled with all levels in mind - from novice to professional 
Written by professionals in this field including three Nobel Laureates 
Includes supplementary material: sn.pub/extras

T1  - Precautionary Rights and Duties of States
AN  - 2132036202
AB  - Concluding that the precautionary principle embodies customary international law is one thing. Determining what this means is quite another. That challenge is met by this work, which resolves a number of crucial questions concerning the scope of this principle of international environmental law; the conditions triggering a right or duty to take precautionary action; the measures to be taken; the allocation of the burden of proof; and the role of socio-economic factors. These questions are dealt with one at a time through the charting and analysis of patterns and common denominators in the extensive (inter)national practice of states regarding the precautionary principle. The hard legal core of the principle is thus gradually exposed. In the process, a realistic and accessible account is given of how and to what extent this general principle can and does direct the actions of states in concrete instances. Ultimately, this work sets out what it takes to act in conformity with the precautionary principle under general international law, and will be of interest to anyone involved with international law and environmental protection.

T1  - Diet shifts of lesser scaup are consistent with the spring condition hypothesis
AN  - 220486818
AB  - We compared diets of lesser scaup (Aythya affinis (Eyton, 1838)) in the springs of 2000 and 2001 to those reported in the 1970s and the 1980s to determine whether forage quality has declined as predicted by the spring condition hypothesis. In Minnesota, we found that the current aggregate percentage of Amphipoda (an important food item) in lesser scaup diets was 94% lower than that reported from the same locations in the 1980s. Current mean individual prey mass of Amphipoda and Bivalvia in Minnesota were 86.6% and 85.1% lower than historical levels, respectively. In Manitoba, current aggregate percentages of Trichoptera and Chaoboridae in lesser scaup diets (1% and 0%, respectively) were lower than those reported from the same location in the 1970s (14% and 2%, respectively), whereas the percentage of Chironomidae (40%) was higher than that of historical levels (19%). Current mean individual prey mass of all insects, seeds, Chironomidae, and Zygoptera in Manitoba were 63.5%, 65.4%, 44.1%, and 44.9% lower than those of historical levels, respectively. The observed dietary shift from Amphipoda to less nutritious prey in Minnesota, coupled with lower mean individual prey mass in both locations, likely constitutes lower forage quality in lesser scaup diets, which is consistent with the spring condition hypothesis.

T1  - Swans' beauty hides danger, warns biologist: [Final Edition]
AN  - 354852980
AB  - [Patrick Hubert] said the swans "can be a problem for other birds because they are very aggressive and because they are very territorial." Paired mute swans will drive out nesting geese and ducks displacing bird species that have long made Lake Ontario their home.

              
   In a recent paper co-authored by Scott Petrie of Bird Studies Canada in Port Rowan, Ont., an expert on the mute swan, he warns because of similar climate to its native Eurasian territory, and increasingly warmer winters, the existing swan population of roughly 2,000 across the Great Lakes could grow to 30,000 within 30 years.

              
Photo: Derek Baldwin, Osprey News Network / This pair of mute swans on the Moira River in Belleville are the symbol of beauty and elegance, but there are hidden dangers behind a growing surge in their population on area waters. Experts are calling for a cull to remove the threat against other birds and danger to wetland habitat.

T1  - Application of the fuzzy performance measures to the City of London water supply system
AN  - 213366481
AB  - Most engineering systems are subject to a wide range of possible uncertain future conditions. The probabilistic reliability analysis usually fails to address the problems of human error, subjectivity, and lack of system performance history and records. This paper explores the utility of the following fuzzy performance measures for evaluating the performance of a complex water supply system: (i) combined reliability-vulnerability, (ii) robustness, and (iii) resiliency. The regional water supply system for the City of London, Ontario, Canada, is used as the case study. The computational requirements for the implementation of the fuzzy performance measures and their sensitivity to different shapes of fuzzy membership functions are investigated. The study illustrates the capability of the fuzzy performance measures to handle uncertainty and identify critical system components. This can be of value in identifying the optimal level of improvement that will increase the overall system performance. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World
AN  - 2134266223
AB  - With more than 5,000 works cited, Handbook of Avian Hybrids of the World is the greatest compendium of information ever published on hybridization in birds. Worldwide in scope, it provides information on all reported avian crosses, not only those occurring in captivity, but also in a natural setting (approximately 4,000 crosses are covered). This book is a basic reference, intended both for the serious birder and the professional biologist. McCarthy's work fills a need for reference material that takes into account the last half century of data. It will be of interest to workers in a wide variety of fields, ranging from animal behavior to genetics, ecology, zoology, and systematics. In fact, it will make fascinating reading for anyone interested in birds and the natural world.

T1  - Genes in Conflict:&nbsp;The Biology of Selfish Genetic Elements
AN  - 2131019310
AB  - In evolution, most genes survive and spread within populations because they increase the ability of their hosts (or their close relatives) to survive and reproduce. But some genes spread in spite of being harmful to the host organism--by distorting their own transmission to the next generation, or by changing how the host behaves toward relatives. As a consequence, different genes in a single organism can have diametrically opposed interests and adaptations. Covering all species from yeast to humans, Genes in Conflict is the first book to tell the story of selfish genetic elements, those continually appearing stretches of DNA that act narrowly to advance their own replication at the expense of the larger organism. As Austin Burt and Robert Trivers show, these selfish genes are a universal feature of life with pervasive effects, including numerous counter-adaptations. Their spread has created a whole world of socio-genetic interactions within individuals, usually completely hidden from sight. Genes in Conflict introduces the subject of selfish genetic elements in all its aspects, from molecular and genetic to behavioral and evolutionary. Burt and Trivers give us access for the first time to a crucial area of research--now developing at an explosive rate--that is cohering as a unitary whole, with its own logic and interconnected questions, a subject certain to be of enduring importance to our understanding of genetics and evolution.

T1  - Estuaries. The Handbook of Environmental Chemistry
AN  - 2136200530
AB  - In this book, aspects of the biogeochemistry of estuaries from a variety of environments, from the tropics to the Arctic, are discussed. In most cases the courses of these rivers have been altered by dams or diversions; the results of these changes on the nature of the estuary are also discussed, where such data is available. In the case of the Tasmanian rivers, the estuary of the Huon, a largely untouched river, is contrasted with that of the Derwent, a river heavily influenced by industry. The future state of all of these estuaries may be a sensitive indicator of shifts in global weather patterns.

T1  - Ecosystem Function in Heterogeneous Landscapes
AN  - 2134370344
AB  - The study of ecosystems, fundamental to ecology, has been complemented by the growing field of landscape ecology.  Ecosystem Function in Heterogeneous Landscapes addresses how interactions among ecosystems affect the functioning of individual ecosystems and the larger landscape.  This groundbreaking synthesis unites ecosystem ecology's knowledge of system function with landscape ecology's knowledge of spatial structure.  
Practical concerns about scaling up from individual ecosystems to larger landscapes require an understanding of how networks of interacting ecosystems function together.  The book elucidates the challenges faced by ecosystem scientists working in spatially heterogeneous systems, relevant conceptual approaches used in other disciplines and in different ecosystem types, and the importance of spatial heterogeneity in conservation resource management.  The distinguished authors discuss how how much heterogeneity needs to be taken into account for specific types of scientific and management issues.  Their chapters cover the spectrum from proposing novel conceptual approaches to detailing the practical implications of heterogeneous landscapes for fire management, water management and conservation planning.
Ecosystem Function in Heterogeneous Landscapes addresses how interactions among ecosystems affect the functioning of individual ecosystems and the larger landscape. This groundbreaking synthesis unites ecosystem ecology's knowledge of system function with landscape ecology's knowledge of spatial structure. The book elucidates challenges of working in spatially heterogeneous systems, approaches used in other disciplines and in different ecosystem types, and the importance of spatial heterogeneity in conservation resource management.No comparable book exists. Contributing authors provide overviews of specific disciplines, while several prominent scientists write synthesis chapters which help the reader draw connections between the fields of landscape ecology and ecosystem ecology This synthesis unites ecosystem ecology's knowledge of system function with landscape ecology's knowledge of spatial structure

T1  - Twilight of the Mammoths:&nbsp;Ice Age Extinctions and the Rewilding of America
AN  - 2131095165
AB  - As recently as 11,000 years ago--"near time" to geologists--mammoths, mastodons, gomphotheres, ground sloths, giant armadillos, native camels and horses, the dire wolf, and many other large mammals roamed North America. In what has become one of science's greatest riddles, these large animals vanished in North and South America around the time humans arrived at the end of the last great ice age. Part paleontological adventure and part memoir, 
Twilight of the Mammoths presents in detail internationally renowned paleoecologist Paul Martin's widely discussed and debated "overkill" hypothesis to explain these mysterious megafauna extinctions. Taking us from Rampart Cave in the Grand Canyon, where he finds himself "chest deep in sloth dung," to other important fossil sites in Arizona and Chile, Martin's engaging book, written for a wide audience, uncovers our rich evolutionary legacy and shows why he has come to believe that the earliest Americans literally hunted these animals to death. 

As he discusses the discoveries that brought him to this hypothesis, Martin relates many colorful stories and gives a rich overview of the field of paleontology as well as his own fascinating career. He explores the ramifications of the overkill hypothesis for similar extinctions worldwide and examines other explanations for the extinctions, including climate change. Martin's visionary thinking about our missing megafauna offers inspiration and a challenge for today's conservation efforts as he speculates on what we might do to remedy this situation--both in our thinking about what is "natural" and in the natural world itself.

AN  - 2131345669
AB  - This volume reflects the latest developments in the research of a global community of rotifer researchers, who came together at Illmitz, Austria in 2003. Contributions are manifold and span fields from phylogeny and evolution of the phylum Rotifera to practical aspects of aquaculture and ecotoxicology. Major issues include phylogeny and evolution, genetics and molecular ecology, new aspects of rotifer anatomy through the application of confocal laser-scanning microscopy, anhydrobiosis, long-term studies in lakes and rivers, population dynamics and community ecology, trophic relationships between copepods and rotifers, alongside biodiversity studies based on classical taxonomic concepts and molecular approaches. Although primarily focussed on one taxonomic group, the scientific outcome of this meeting is of relevance to the study of other aquatic microinvertebrates as well.

T1  - Oil Spill Dispersants:&nbsp;Efficacy and Effects
AN  - 2131417463
AB  - Although significant steps have been taken over the last 15 years to reduce the size and frequency of oil spills, the sheer volume of petroleum consumed in the United States and the complex production and distribution network required to meet the demand make spills of oil and other petroleum products inevitable. Approximately 3 million gallons of oil or refined petroleum products are spilled into U.S. waters every year. Oil dispersants (chemical agents such as surfactants, solvents, and other compounds) are used to reduce the effect of oil spills by changing the chemical and physical properties of the oil. By enhancing the amount of oil that physically mixes into the water, dispersants can reduce the potential that a surface slick will contaminate shoreline habitats. Although called for in the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 as a tool for minimizing the impact of oil spills, the use of chemical dispersants has long been controversial. This report reviews the adequacy of existing information and ongoing research regarding the effectiveness of dispersants as an oil spill response technique, as well as the effect of dispersed oil on marine and coastal ecosystems. It includes recommended steps to be taken to better support policymakers faced with making hard choices regarding the use of dispersants as part of spill contingency planning efforts or during actual spills.

ATU strives to develop, validate, standardize, modernize (and promote the commercialization of) bioanalytical and biomarker techniques, making use of new instrumental technologies whenever possible, in order to determine the potential (geno)toxicity of chemicals and various types of environmental matrices (e.g., effluents, sediments, pore/surface waters). ATU research output provides practical tools and approaches which facilitate decision-making for environmental management of aquatic ecosystems such as the Saint-Lawrence River. ATU also provides (inter)national technology transfer to interested professionals and agencies and promotes graduate student training by co-directing applied research projects with university collaborators. 
Dr. Blaise obtained university diplomas from the U. of Montréal (B.A., 1967: biology and chemistry), U. of Ottawa (B.Sc., 1970: cell biology; M.Sc., 1973: environmental microbiology) and U. of Metz (D.Sc., 1984: ecotoxicology). He is a member of the editorial board for two scientific journals (Environmental Toxicology; Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety) and holds membership in both the biologists'' (Association des Biologistes du Québec) and microbiologists'' (Association des Microbiologistes du Québec) associations of the province of Québec. He regularly attends and makes presentations during major venues held in the field of ecotoxicology (SETAC: Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry; SECOTOX: Society of Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety; ATW-Canada: Aquatic Toxicity Workshop-Canada;ISTA: International Symposium on Toxicity Assessment). Dr. Blaise has (co)authored over 100 scientific articles in internationally refereed journals, as well as having written several book chapters, reviews, and various government technical reports. 
He recently co-edited, with Canadian colleagues, a book dedicated to small-scale toxicity testing (Wells, P., K. Lee and C. Blaise (eds.), 1998. Microscale testing in Aquatic Toxicology Advances, Techniques and Practice. CRC Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, Florida, 679 pages). He was scientific organizer of the 10th International Symposium on Toxicity Assessment (ISTA 10), hosted by the Saint-Lawrence Centre where he works, and held in Quebec City, August 26-31, 2001. He further co-edited with another Canadian colleague, a special edition of Environ. Toxicol. (Volume 17 [3]: 2002, special issue) highlighting selected papers presented at the ISTA 10 venue. 
Jean-François Férard, D.Sc., is a professor at the University of Metz (Lorraine province of France), where he heads a research team (RT) which is part of a C.N.R.S. (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique) research unit for Ecotoxicity and Environmental Health (E.S.E). He also manages an undergraduate school program dedicated to Environmental Engineering. His teaching duties involve fundamental and applied Ecotoxicology, Physiology and Physiotoxicology, Cell Biology and other related disciplines. 
In the field of ecotoxicology, his RT was involved in the behavior of metals, PAHs and complex mixtures in air, water and soil compartments and their effects on different organisms (bacteria, algae, crustaceans, plants, arthropods, etc.). His actual research endeavors are more specifically focused on the development of metal-resistance (e.g. phytochelatin) and genotoxic (e.g. comet assay) biomarkers. He also promotes knowledge and use of toxicity tests by organizing an annual course entitled "Ecotoxicity andcarcinogenicity of chemicals" which provides a theoretical and practical view of numerous toxicity tests to decision-makers, industrialists and consultants. Since 1974, he has markedly contributed to numerous research programs that have successfully lead to i) development and validation of different ecotoxicity tools (e.g. new toxicity test methods, trophic chain models, biomarkers), ii) hazard/risk assessment schemes and iii) links between field and laboratory studies. These undertakings were financially supported by the European Economic Community, the French ministry of the Environment, and agencies such as the French Water Agency of the Rhin-Meuse Watershed, the French Agency for Environment and Energy Ressources. 
Professor Férard obtained university diplomas from the U. of Strasbourg (B.A., 1970: biology and chemistry; B.Sc., 1973: biochemistry) and U. of Metz (M.Sc., 1974: chemistry and environmental toxicology; D.Sc., 1978: environmental toxicology; State doctorate, 1986: environmental toxicology). He was European editor for Environmental Toxicology and Water Quality from 1992-1996 and holds membership in SETAC (Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry). He regularly makes presentations during major symposia held in the field of ecotoxicology (e.g. SETAC meetings, Secotox conferences, International Symposia on Toxicity Assessment, Annual Aquatic Toxicity Workshops in Canada). Professor Férard has (co)authored over 50 scientific articles in (inter)nationally refereed journals, as well as having written several book chapters, reviews, and research reports. He also participates in several OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and AFNOR (Association française de normalisation - French standards association) initiatives to standardize and promote the use of biological tests.

T1  - Insects As Natural Enemies:&nbsp;A Practical Perspective
AN  - 2131929622
AB  - Over the past three decades there has been a dramatic increase in theoretical and practical studies on insect natural enemies. This considerably updated and expanded version of a previous best-seller is an account of major aspects of the biology of predators and parasitoids, punctuated with information and advice on which experiments or observations to conduct, and how to carry them out. This book is unique among the many works on the subject, as a general text emphasizing practicalities and providing guidance on further literature.Provides information and advice on the theoretical and - most importantly - the practical aspects of studying insect predators and parasitoids

T1  - Area pickerel fishery in danger: [Final Edition]
AN  - 354721921
AB  - [Roger Fayle], spokesman for the Rice Lake Tourist Association, said because of the ongoing pickerel decline, which started about a decade earlier, the association is recommending pickerel hatcheries be located in at least three places adjacent to the 50-kilometre long lake.

              
   He said people are catching pickerel, but the number of catches are down compared to past years. And, he stressed because there are fewer pickerel there are fewer anglers, especially during the season opener.

              
   In addition, black crappie, a fish species first noticed in the Kawartha Lakes about 15 years ago, competes for traditional pickerel habitat and feeds on pickerel fry.

T1  - Monitoring of priority hazardous substances in Estonian water bodies and in the coastal Baltic Sea
AN  - 2676601364
AB  - The water sub-programme of the Estonian National Environmental Monitoring Programme aims to monitor and to develop an information support system for the protection of inland surface waters, transitional waters, coastal waters and groundwater. Focusing on problem areas and reflecting intensive human impact, monitoring of hazardous substances is targeted at populated industrial metropolitan areas in Tallinn and in the oil-shale region of north-eastern Estonia. During the last decade the state of the environment regarding priority hazardous substances has continuously improved. According to monitoring results, the concentration of hazardous substances in sediments and in surface water remains low in the majority of Estonian rivers, and their quality by European standards is classified as good. Concentrations of hazardous substances found in Baltic fish in the Estonian coastal sea remain below standards established by the FAO/WHO for food. The key to the improvement of monitoring is the integration of source-oriented and load-oriented approaches, since both are lacking full-scale consistent data coverage.

T1  - Origins of the Social Mind:&nbsp;Evolutionary Psychology and Child Development
AN  - 2131087534
AB  - Until now, evolutionary psychologists have focused largely on understanding adult behavior, giving little sustained attention to childhood. Developmental psychologists, for their part, have been wary of the perceived genetic determinism of evolutionary thinking. This important volume brings together an array of prominent developmental scientists whose work is explicitly driven by evolutionary concerns. Presenting sophisticated new models for understanding gene-environment interactions, the authors demonstrate how evolutionary knowledge can enhance our understanding of key aspects of cognitive, social, and personality development. Tightly edited chapters examine how different developmental mechanisms have evolved and what role they play in children's functioning and their adaptation to adult life. Essential topics covered include parent-child relationships, aggression, puberty, infant perception and cognition, memory, language, and more.

T1  - Environmental Management and Development
AN  - 2134869435
AB  - The continual degradation of the planet's environment is something that affects every person in every country, be it developed or developing. Statements and policies are made at international levels, but their effectiveness is questionable. Also, are techniques of environmental managment (EM) used in the west appropriate and relevant to the much poorer developing countries' needs and priorities? How can these countries be expected to follow policies, or to even just have a responsible attitude to the environment, when the governments of western developed countries have failed to keep standards set or have side-stepped policies and repeatedly shrugged off any sense of global responsibility? Courses on environment and development usually have a strong environmental management component. By focusing on environmental management this book is very different from existing environment and development texts, whose emphasis is on listing problems, making warnings and voicing advocacy. This title moves on from these viewpoints to look at practical management and problem-solving techniques.; Environmental management, by definition, also encompasses global problems and future challenges for our increasingly globalised society. Environmental Management and Development clarifies the definition, nature and role of environmental management in development and developing countries. It begins with an introduction to the key terms, issues and tools of environmental management, which are linked and developed in the following chapters on specific environmental issues, making extensive use of global-local case studies. The book concludes by discussing who pays for EM and the future for EM in developing countries.

T1  - Battling alien invaders: [ONT Edition]
AN  - 438742734
AB  - It's estimated that a new species is found in Ontario's waterways every six or seven months. And experts warn of a phenomenon called  "invasional meltdown," where each group of new invaders makes it  easier for additional waves of alien species to become established.                 Professor Hugh MacIsaac, of the Great Lakes Institute for  Environmental Research at the University of Windsor, has applied for funding to fight the invaders by bringing together experts from 15  universities, as well as from federal and provincial government  labs. He needs $7.9 million from the Natural Sciences and  Engineering Research Council of Canada to explore new ways of  blunting the rise of alien species.

T1  - Waterborne Zoonoses:&nbsp;Identification, Causes and Control
AN  - 2132085504
AB  - Zoonoses are caused by microorganisms of animal origin that can also infect humans. Apart from human-to-human transmitted pathogens, they are the microorganisms of greatest concern in regard to threats to drinking-water and ambient water safety, now and in the future. A significant number of emerging and re-emerging waterborne zoonotic pathogens have been recognized over recent decades. SARS, E. coli O157: H7, and Cryptosporidium provide examples of zoonoses with waterborne routes of transmission. Developed from an expert workshop of 29 scientists convened by the World Health Organization and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), Waterborne Zoonoses: Identification, Causes and Control provides a critical assessment of current knowledge about waterborne zoonoses and identifies strategies and research needs for controlling future emerging waterborne zoonoses.This book provides guidance to agriculturists, veterinarians, worldwide health agencies and water providers to anticipate potential future waterborne disease problems and to determine whether current practices will be protective or whether new approaches need to be deployed to better protect the health of both humans and animals

T1  - Oceanography and Marine Biology:&nbsp;An Annual Review. Volume 42
AN  - 2141126599
AB  - Ever-increasing interest in oceanography and marine biology and its relevance to global environmental issues creates a demand for authoritative reviews summarizing the results of recent research. Oceanography and Marine Biology: An Annual Review has answered this demand since its founding by the late Harold Barnes more than forty years ago. Its objective is an annual consideration of basic areas of marine research, dealing with subjects of special or immediate importance, adding new subjects as they arise.The volumes maintain a unified perspective on the marine sciences. Physical, chemical, and biological aspects of marine science are dealt with by experts actively engaged in these fields. This essential reference text for researchers and students in all fields of marine science finds a place in libraries of marine stations and institutes, as well as universities. It consistently ranks among the highest in impact factors for the marine biology category of the citation indices compiled by the Institute for Scientific Information.; V olume 42 contains analysis on convective chimneys in the Greenland Sea, spawning aggregations of coral reef fishes, exopolymers (EPS) in aquatic systems, the marine insect Halobates, and much more.

T1  - Cormorant cull fight heads to Hamilton East; Environmental activists will make radio appeal to voters: [Final Edition]
AN  - 270156098
AB  - Activists who have been unable to stop a government cull of thousands of cormorants in Presqu'ile Provincial Park said yesterday they plan to hit back by urging people to not vote for the Liberal candidate in next week's byelection in Hamilton East.                 Environment Minister Leona Dombrowsky had put the cull on hold after receiving a request for a full environmental review from a group of activists on April 16. But she changed her mind this week to allow a "limited cull" to proceed.              Photo: Cathie Coward, the Hamilton Spectator / Cormorants nest off Eastport Drive in Hamilton. Activists want to stop a cull near Brighton.

T1  - The Story of Life
AN  - 2131954194
AB  - How did life begin? What was 'snowball earth'? Why did the dinosaurs become extinct? Are we all descended from 'African Eve'? Will humans be responsible for the next major extinction? These and many other fundamental questions are addressed in this masterly account of The Story of Life, by eminent biologist and teacher Richard Southwood.The story unfolds with the formation of the earth around four thousand million years ago. Life first emerged a hundred million years later, and it took another fifteen million years for more complex life-forms to appear. Periods of relative calm were punctuated by five major extinctions, with innumerable minor jolts along the way. Then, five million years ago, an able ape evolved that gradually came to dominate and control the other animals and plants. The future now lies in the hands of this single species, Homo sapiens.In this carefully crafted story, Southwood's love of his subject, and for the life he describes, shines through, to engage and inform scientist and general reader alike.

T1  - Invasive fish may hurt Great Lakes: [Final Edition]
AN  - 267056565
AB  - Toronto conservation officials doing a routine survey of the fish population at the mouth of the Don River recently discovered a grass carp. The large, grey fish with black-edged scales is one of four invasive Asian carp species authorities fear could upset the delicate ecology of Canada's Great Lakes.                 "All those things we value most about the Great Lakes could and would change if invasive species continue to become established,'' said Nicholas Mandrak, a research scientist with the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans.                 Several bighead carp have also been discovered in Canadian waters of the Great Lakes; the black carp and silver carp have yet to make an appearance.

T1  - Urban Open Spaces
AN  - 2131348852
AB  - There is enormous interest in urban design and the regeneration of our urban areas, but current thinking often concentrates on the built form, forgetting the important role that open spaces play. Urban Open Spaces brings together extensive research and practical experience to prove the opportunities and benefits of different types of open space to society and individuals. Focusing on the importance of open spaces in daily urban life, the book is divided into three sections. The first section describes the social, health, environmental and economic benefits and opportunities that open spaces can provide. The second section discusses the different types of urban open spaces that individuals or communities might use on a daily basis: from private gardens to commercial squares and waterway corridors. The final section provides best practice case-studies demonstrating urban spaces being incorporated in new developments and community initiatives. This is the first book to bring together a variety of evidence from different disciplines to outline the benefits and opportunities of urban open spaces in an accessible way. Not just for students and practitioners, this book will be of value for anyone interested in the design, development, regeneration, funding and use of open spaces in urban areas.

T1  - Glorious smelt run fast becoming history: [Final Edition]
AN  - 270132633
AB  - In addition, salmon and lake trout target the larger smelt -- "they're size-selective predators" -- and large smelt (over 15 cms) have virtually disappeared. Over the past two decades, the percentage of large smelt in the trawl survey has been reduced by 95 per cent.                 The effect on the overall smelt population is disproportionately large because the mature females are considerably more productive than their smaller counterparts. Another factor is the alarming decline of diporeia, a tiny shrimp-like crustacean that smelt feed on. Diporeia are already extinct in Lake Erie and increasingly rare in Lake Michigan, Lake Huron and Lake Ontario, a phenomenon [Randy Owens] believes is linked to the introduction of zebra mussels into the Great Lakes in the '80s.                 On the right night, at the right spot, the bounty could be overwhelming and the annual smelt run developed into a ritual that was as sure a sign of spring as the blossoms on fruit trees. The best smelt, of course, were the ones that went directly into a frying pan over a beach fire and were consumed on the spot. The smelt run as a cultural phenomenon, the mass celebration of spring harvest, is past. A few diehards still stake out the wharves and shores, but the outrageous easy pickings are gone.

T1  - Strength in numbers when it comes to the Great Lakes mayors: [Final Edition]
AN  - 359290172
AB  - In the age-old belief there is strength in numbers - and often there is - Chicago Mayor Richard Daley recently proposed forming a lobby group of mayors around the Great Lakes to make them key players in decisions affecting the lakes.                 The entire Great Lakes waterway system is linked from the mouth of the St. Lawrence Seaway through to Thunder Bay. What happens at one end can eventually have a serious effect on the other end and all points in between.                 The Chicago mayor learned about issues that have vexed Great Lakes ecologists for years, including the onslaught of alien species in the lakes such as the tenacious zebra mussel and the round eyed goby.

T1  - Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments, Volume 1:&nbsp;Coastal and fresh waters
AN  - 2131854503
AB  - These new Guidelines for Safe Recreational Water Environments describe the present state of knowledge regarding the impact of recreational use of coastal and freshwater environments upon the health of users — specifically drowning and injury, exposure to cold, heat and sunlight, water quality (especially exposure to water contaminated by sewage, but also exposure to free-living pathogenic microorganisms in recreational water), contamination of beach sand, exposure to algae and their products, exposure to chemical and physical agents, and dangerous aquatic organisms. In addition, control and monitoring of the hazards associated with these environments are discussed. 
The primary aim of the Guidelines is the protection of public health. The Guidelines are intended to be used as the basis for the development of international and national approaches (including standards and regulations) to controlling the health risks from hazards that may be encountered in recreational water environments, as well as providing a framework for local decision-making. The Guidelines may also be used as reference material for industries and operators preparing development projects in recreational water areas, as a checklist for understanding and assessing potential health impacts of recreational projects, and in the conduct of environmental impact and environmental health impact assessments in particular.

T1  - Biological Control in IPM Systems in Africa
AN  - 2131094413
AB  - Biological control has made a major contribution to integrated pest management (IPM) in Africa, but its documentation has been scattered and often under-reported. This book provides a review of the most important studies, including not only successes, but also on-going challenges. The focus is on arthropod pests and weeds, but diseases are also covered where significant. Case studies and promising research results are presented in 24 chapters that cover biocontrol by naturally occurring agents, exotic agents or seasonal manipulation. Although particularly relevant to pest control professionals working in Africa, this book also provides a useful reference for scientists worldwide.

T1  - Great Lakes at risk from alien fish invasion: [Final Edition]
AN  - 355789405
AB  - [Cynthia Kolar] said most of the alien species introduced into the Great Lakes arrive in the water that ships carry in ballast tanks. Ships take on tonnes of water in the Caspian or Black Seas for stability while crossing the Atlantic, and larvae or baby fish are sucked in. When the ships dump their ballast in the Great Lakes, they also dump the alien species.                 Some introduced species have been devastating. The United States and Canada spend about $15 million US a year to control the lamprey, a snakelike bloodsucker that attaches itself to larger fish. The lamprey almost drove the native lake trout to extinction when it first expanded into the Great Lakes, said Kolar.

T1  - Feds assailed over Great Lakes invaders: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349456881
AB  - [Johanne Gelinas] described it as a national problem which has devastating effects on the environment and the economy, costing billions. She said invasive species can affect water bodies, wetlands and agricultural crops and forests.

              
   Gelinas said ship ballast water remains the most important source of unintentional introductions of aquatic invasive species.

              
   Gelinas blasted Ottawa for slow progress in screening the estimated 23,000 industrial chemicals and 6,000 pesticides being used in Canada. "The worst of these toxic substances have been linked to lung disease, reproductive problems and birth defects, cancers, developmental disorders, allergic reactions, lowered resistance to diseases and other illnesses."

T1  - Scientists examining health of Great Lakes: [Final Edition]
AN  - 349332185
AB  - Invasive species and urban sprawl are two of the main concerns being identified by Canadian and United States scientists attending a conference on the Great Lakes basin in Ohio this week.

              
   The trends seen in the Great Lakes are reflected in Lake Ontario, although some of the contaminant indicators are slightly higher because it is at the end of the chain of lakes.

              
   John Mills, regional director general for Environment Canada, who leads the Canadian effort on the Great Lakes, said previous studies that showed toxic-waste contamination in the Niagara River is being reduced. He said most of the dumps leaking toxic waste were on the U.S. side of the 60-kilometre stretch of river.

T1  - Voracious jumping Asian carp threatens Great Lakes: [Final Edition]
AN  - 355658830
AB  - The dreaded Asian carp, which escaped nearly a decade ago into the southern Mississippi River in Arkansas, is now within 40 km of Lake Michigan and could have a devastating effect on the Great Lakes, far beyond the damage caused by the sea lamprey or zebra mussels, according to a warning issued yesterday by the International Joint Commission.                 In a July 5 letter to Canada's foreign affairs minister, Bill Graham, and U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, the IJC calls on the American government to stop Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes.                 "The other option is to close the Chicago Ship and Sanitary Canal connected to the Great Lakes near Chicago, Illinois, and cut off the river from our Great Lakes. But that wouldn't be economically viable."

T1  - Aldo Leopold and the Ecological Conscience
AN  - 2135101997
AB  - In Aldo Leopold and an Ecological Conscience ecologists, wildlife biologists, and other professional conservationists explore the ecological legacy of Aldo Leopold and his A Sand County Almanac and his contributions to the environmental movement, the philosophy of science, and natural resource management. Twelve personal essays describe the enormous impact he has had on each author, from influencing the daily operations of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the creation of a land-use ethics guide for Forest Service personnel, to much needed inspiration for continuing on in today's large, complex and often problematic world of science. Here is Aldo Leopold as a mentor, friend, and companion and an affirmation of his hope that science will continue to be practiced in the cause of conservation.

AB  - In September 2000, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) asked the National Research Council to assemble a committee to study the trends and forces in science and technology (S&T), industrial management, the economy, and society that are likely to affect research and development as well as the introduction of technological innovations over the next 5 to 10 years. NIST believed that such a study would provide useful supporting information as it planned future programs to achieve its goals of strengthening the U.S. economy and improving the quality of life for U.S. citizens by working with industry to develop and apply technology, measurements, and standards.

T1  - Marine Issues:&nbsp;From a Scientific, Political and Legal Perspective
AN  - 2131047117
AB  - This volume collects a number of essays and articles from about twenty experts in various fields connected to marine environmental issues. These essays were first presented at the XXVIII Pacem in Maribus Conference held in December 2000, at the International Tribunal of the Law of the Sea in Hamburg, Germany. The purpose of the Conference was to enhance awareness of the European public, governments, the private sector and academia about the importance of responsible ocean and coastal management based on ocean science. Reflecting the innovative interdisciplinary approach of the conference, these volume groups contributors from leading biologists, political scientists, geographers, and jurists according to specific regional relevance and not along strict disciplinary lines. This approach allows the experts to treat marine issues concerning regions such as the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, or the Black Sea in a comprehensive manner.
 
 This collection could become an essential instrument for scholars and scientists working within the field of marine environmental issues.

AN  - 219325697
AB  - Magnitudes and patterns in the deposition of chlorophyll (Chl), organic carbon, particulate phosphorus (PP), and suspended solids are documented for seven New York reservoirs based on analyses of metalimnetic and near-bottom sediment trap collections. Inorganic material dominated the trap collections and caused a decoupling of the downward fluxes of Chl and PP because of major contributions of inorganic components to P deposition.

T1  - Pollution:&nbsp;Causes, Effects and Control
AN  - 2131906774
AB  - Pollution: Causes, Effects and Control is the fourth edition of a best-selling introductory level book dealing with chemical and radioactive pollution in its broadest sense. The scope of the book ranges from the sources of pollutants and their environmental behaviour, to their effects on human and non-human receptors, to the technologies and strategies available for control. 
The fourth edition has been wholly revised and updated from the previous edition due to the rapid pace of developments in this field. Topics covered include chemical pollution of freshwater and marine environments, drinking water quality, water pollution biology, sewage and its treatment, toxic wastes, air pollution and atmospheric chemistry, control of pollutant emissions, land contamination, solid waste management, clean technologies, persistent organic pollutants in the environment, environmental radioactivity, health effects of environmental chemicals, legal control of pollution and integrated pollution control. There is a completely new chapter on Clean Technologies and Industrial Ecology, reflecting the growing importance of pollution prevention as opposed to end-of-pipe solutions. 
Whilst originally intended as an introductory reference work for professionals within the field, the book has been widely adopted for teaching purposes at the undergraduate and postgraduate level.Pollution: Causes, Effects and Control is the fourth edition of a best-selling introductory level book dealing with chemical and radioactive pollution in its broadest sense.

T1  - Careless development killed fishery: [Final Edition]
AN  - 348845255
AB  - Gravel is important for successful brook trout spawning and acts as a filter for sediment. Despite efforts by a conservation group, little was done. This year, [Rick Matusiak] observed the creek first-hand -- the trout were gone, all victims of careless development.

              
   For more than 10 years, Lake Erie has boasted some of the finest smallmouth bass fishing found anywhere in the world. License plates from Ontario, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and even Tennessee adorned boat trailers at the ramp.

              
Photo: Supplied Photo / Thanks to conservation efforts (and zebra mussels) Lake Erie has become one of the best spots for smallmout bass. Here, angler John Vandivier shows off a lunker smallmouth he caught on the lake. ;

AB  - During 2-12 August 1999, the development of a surface bloom dominated by the cyanobacterium Nodularia spumigena was followed in the western Gulf of Finland, Baltic Sea. Intense surface scums of aggregated N. spumigena existed on calm days. Empty N. spumigena cells and trace amounts of cell-bound nodularin were found in surficial sediment, indicating that toxin-producing N. spumigena had reached the seafloor.

T1  - Increase in fish baffles scientists; Sewage suspected as source of food: [Final Edition]
AN  - 254397569
AB  - The populations of algae and zooplankton, the microscopic building blocks fish and other wildlife that make Lake Erie the biologically richest of the Great Lakes, have not been increasing. And the binational effort begun in the 1970s to drastically reduce phosphorous inflows has been a success, further limiting the nutritional supply to the lake.                 While the abundance of new life in Lake Erie is great news to those concerned about its health, scientists meeting at this week's Lake Erie in the Millennium conference at the University of Windsor nevertheless harbour worries about this important source of nutrition they've discovered.                 [Bruce Manny] marvels at the "remarkable recovery from virtual extinction" of western Lake Erie's mayfly population, but he also wonders what this favourite bit of fish food, suspected to be feasting on sewage during its larval stage, might be introducing into the food web: "I thought, 'My God, what's in their food?' "

T1  - Global Change Ecosystems Research
AN  - 2131011735
AB  - Research Council established the Ecosystems Panel in response to a request from the United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP). The panel's charge included periodic reviews of the ecosystems aspects of the USGCRP, and this is the first of those reviews. It is based on information provided by the USGCRP, including Our Changing Planet (NSTC 1997 and earlier editions 1); ideas and conversations provided by participants in a workshop held in St. Michaels, Maryland, in July 1998; and the deliberations of the panel. In addition, the panel reviewed the ecosystems chapter of the NRC report Global Environmental Change: Research Pathways for the Next Decade (NRC 1999a, known as the Pathways report). 
The USGCRP is an interagency program established in 1989 and codified by the Global Change Research Act of 1990 (PL 101-606). The USGCRP comprises representatives of the departments of Agriculture, Commerce (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Institute of Standards and Technology), Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services (the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences), Interior, and State, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation, the Smithsonian Institution, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and Budget, and the intelligence community (NSTC 1997). The USGCRP's research program is described in detail in Our Changing Planet (NSTC 1997, 1999). In brief, the program focuses on four major areas of earth-system science: 1) Seasonal to interannual climate variability; 2) Climate change over decades to centuries; 3) Changes in ozone, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and atmospheric chemistry, and 4) Changes in land cover and in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The fourth topic is the area in which advice was requested from the ecosystems panel. 
The Ecosystems Panel's charge has three parts: to provide a forum for the discussion of questions of ecosystem science of interest to scientists in and out of the federal agencies, to periodically review the ecosystem aspects of the USGCRP's research program, and to help identify general areas of ecosystem science that need additional attention, especially areas that cut across ecosystems and levels of ecological organization. In addressing the second item of its charge for this report, the panel first identified the most significant and challenging areas in ecosystem science, then used that identification as a basis to make recommendations to the USGCRP. Thus, this report is not a detailed review of the USGCRP's program, but rather an attempt to identify those areas that the panel concludes are most in need of attention by a general research program on global change. As noted in this report, some of those areas are already receiving attention by the USGCRP.

T1  - Humans can control big, ugly problem: [Final Edition]
AN  - 348086542
AB  - There's the zebra mussel, a multi-million dollar headache clogging industrial and municipal water intakes. The Ruffe is a useless European fish rapidly displacing natives fish in the rivers and bays around Lake Superior. And then there's Eurasian watermilfoil, a plant that forms thick underwater stands of tangled vegetation that play havoc with boating and fishing, and which is expected to arrive one day in Sarnia Bay.

T1  - Perspectives on Biodiversity:&nbsp;Valuing Its Role in an Everchanging World
AN  - 2131371836
AB  - Resource-management decisions, especially in the area of protecting and maintaining biodiversity, are usually incremental, limited in time by the ability to forecast conditions and human needs, and the result of tradeoffs between conservation and other management goals. The individual decisions may not have a major effect but can have a cumulative major effect. 
 Perspectives on Biodiversity reviews current understanding of the value of biodiversity and the methods that are useful in assessing that value in particular circumstances. It recommends and details a list of components-including diversity of species, genetic variability within and among species, distribution of species across the ecosystem, the aesthetic satisfaction derived from diversity, and the duty to preserve and protect biodiversity. 
 The book also recommends that more information about the role of biodiversity in sustaining natural resources be gathered and summarized in ways useful to managers. Acknowledging that decisions about biodiversity are necessarily qualitative and change over time because of the nonmarket nature of so many of the values, the committee recommends periodic reviews of management decisions.

T1  - Handbook of Biological Control:&nbsp;Principles and Applications of Biological Control
AN  - 2131145993
AB  - For many years the use of chemical agents such as pesticides and herbicides has been effective in controlling the many varieties of pests that infest both agricultural crops and backyard gardens. However, these pests are gradually becoming resistant to these agents, because the agents themselves are acting as selective factors making the pests better and better able to resist and persist. As a result, the use of biological controlling agents is increasing. This book is a comprehensive and authoritative handbook of biological control.

T1  - Sustaining Marine Fisheries
AN  - 2131910013
AB  - Fluctuations and declines in marine fish populations have caused growing concern among marine scientists, fisheries managers, commercial and recreational fishers, and the public. 
 Sustaining Marine Fisheries explores the nature of marine ecosystems and the complex interacting factors that shape their productivity. The book documents the condition of marine fisheries today, highlighting species and geographic areas that are under particular stress. Challenges to achieving sustainability are discussed, and shortcomings of existing fisheries management and regulation are examined. The volume calls for fisheries management to adopt a broader ecosystem perspective that encompasses all relevant environmental and human influences. 
 Sustaining Marine Fisheries offers new approaches to building workable fisheries management institutions, improving scientific data, and developing management tools. The book recommends ways to change current practices that encourage overexploitation of fish resources. It will be of special interest to marine policymakers and ecologists, fisheries regulators and managers, fisheries scientists and marine ecologists, fishers, and concerned individuals.

AB  - Ambient light levels determine the extent of diel vertical migration of many species including mysid shrimps.  Light levels perceived by an organism depend on the intensity of light at the surface, the extinction of light through the water, and the sensitivity of the organism's light receptors.

AN  - 2130903889
AB  - Laboratory Earth taps the relevant knowledge from physical, biological, and social sciences needed to study the planet holistically. This so-called Earth Systems Science fosters a new way to understand the Earth and our roles as inhabitants, with the purpose of building solutions to the bewildering global environment and overdevelopment.Educational, business, health, and governmental organizations often dissect the world into narrow but highly specialized disciplineseconomics, ecology, cardiology, meteorology, glaciology, or political science, to name a few. But real world problems, like urban sprawl, public health, poverty, toxic waste, economic development, the ozone hole, or global warming, do not fit neatly into disciplinary boxes. However, author Stephen Schneider asserts that these contemporary issues must be viewed as systems of interconnected subelements. This is especially true for global environmental problems, since they arise from increasing numbers of people demanding higher standards of living and willing to use the cheapest available technologies to pursue these growth-oriented goals, even if the unintended byproducts include land degradation, toxic pollutants, species extinctions, or global climate change. To first understand and then solve such problems, we must learn to view the Earth and our socioeconomic engine as one integrated system.Schneider, who in the 1970s predicted global warming would become demonstrable” by the turn of the century, chooses that debate to illustrate how this twenty-first century Earth Systems Science approach works, introducing us to the sharp controversies and highly visible debates among climatologists, ecologists, economists, industrialists, and political interests over the seriousness and solutions to the climate change crisis. He begins with a fascinating journey to the beginning of geologic time on Earth and traces from there the coevolution of climate and life over the next four billion years. Along the way we learn about the Gaia Hypothesis, the demise of the dinosaurs, and the likelihood of an impending ice age.Schneider traces our climatic history not only from the beginning and up to the twentieth century, but deep into the twenty-first as well. He depicts the next one hundred years as a potentially perilous period for climate and lifeunless we citizens of Earth recognize and then work to control the unintended global scale experiment we are foisting on ourselves and all other life on Laboratory Earth.” This lab” is not built of glass, wires, and tubes, but of insects, soils, air, oceans, birds, trees, and people. While no honest scientist can claim to have clairvoyant vision into the twenty-first century, Schneider optimistically demonstrates that enough is already known to command our attention and to insure that the juggernaut of human impacts on Earth doesn’t turn into a gamble we can’t afford to lose.

T1  - Round goby invasion bad for Lake Ontario: [Final Edition]
AN  - 269924971
AB  - The "evil goby" is an unwelcome tenant, said Mark Holmes, spokesman for the Ontario Federation of Anglers and Hunters.                 By eating the mussels, which are known to ingest cancer-causing PCBs from the sediment around them, the goby itself becomes contaminated and spreads the contaminants up the food chain, said John Casselman, the Ministry of Natural Resources' senior research scientist for Lake Ontario.                 Round gobies, which can grow to 25 centimetres long, feast on fish eggs and eat young sculpins, darters and perch. In lab experiments, gobies also ate eggs and fry of lake trout, a popular sport fish in Lake Ontario.

T1  - Crustacean invasion: A new threat to B.C.'s shellfish industry shows how fast 'intruders' can devastate native species Science: [Final Edition]
AN  - 269898059
AB  - "This could affect the way in which we do all our intertidal aquaculture," warns Glen Jamieson, a crab specialist at the Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo, B.C.                 In 1995, B.C. waters produced 30,000 tonnes of shellfish for domestic and export markets. After salmon and roe herring, shellfish harvesting is the most important and commercially valuable fishery in the province. It is worth more than all the remaining fisheries - - including cod, hake, red snapper and halibut -- combined.                 The imminent arrival of the green crab means shellfish growers in B.C. and Puget Sound might soon be forced to move from low-cost sea- bed production to a much more costly suspended system. And if experience elsewhere holds true, they will face an expensive installation of small-meshed nets to protect immature clam and oyster colonies from the voracious predator.

T1  - Agricultural Chemicals and the Environment
AN  - 2130871733
AB  - Enormous increases in agricultural productivity can properly be associated with the use of chemicals. This statement applies equally to crop production through the use of fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides, as to livestock production and the associated use of drugs, steroids and other growth accelerators. There is, however a dark side to this picture and it is important to balance the benefits which flow from the use of agricultural chemicals against their environmental impacts which sometimes are seriously disadvantageous. Agricultural Chemicals and the Environment explores a variety of issues which currently are subject to wide-ranging debate and are of concern not only to the scientific establishment and to students, but also to farmers, landowners, managers, legislators, and to the general public.Enormous increases in agricultural productivity can properly be associated with the use of chemicals.

The series has been edited by Professors Hester and Harrison since it began in 1994. 
Professor Roy Harrison OBE is listed by ISI Thomson Scientific (on ISI Web of Knowledge) as a Highly Cited Researcher in the Environmental Science/Ecology category. He has an h-index of 54 (i.e. 54 of his papers have received 54 or more citations in the literature). In 2004 he was appointed OBE for services to environmental science in the New Year Honours List. He was profiled by the Journal of Environmental Monitoring (Vol 5, pp 39N-41N, 2003). Professor Harrison's research interests lie in the field of environment and human health. His main specialism is in air pollution, from emissions through atmospheric chemical and physical transformations to exposure and effects on human health. Much of this work is designed to inform the development of policy. 
Now an emeritus professor, Professor Ron Hester's current activities in chemistry are mainly as an editor and as an external examiner and assessor. He also retains appointments as external examiner and assessor / adviser on courses, individual promotions, and departmental / subject area evaluations both in the UK and abroad.

T1  - Americans want to poison new fish Fishermen fear ruffe: [Final Edition]
AN  - 269780166
AB  - The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources are particularly concerned ruffe fish will migrate from western Lake Superior to Lake Erie and wreak havoc on an already declining yellow perch industry. Biologists fear the ruffe could cause $7-billion in damage to Great Lakes fisheries.                 The 7.5-to-13 centimetre (3-to-5 inch) fish has no natural predators in the Great Lakes. Sharp spines protruding from its fins make the ruffe unappetizing to larger fish. Given its small size, the ruffe has no commercial or sport value.                 The Erie perch fishery, which barely managed to survive the onslaught of zebra mussels in recent years and sea lamprey before that, could find the ruffe to be the final punch.

T1  - Marine Aquaculture:&nbsp;Opportunities for Growth
AN  - 2130933021
AB  - Coastal farming and ocean ranching of marine fish, shellfish, crustaceans, and seaweed are a major and growing industry worldwide. In the United States, freshwater aquaculture is rapidly becoming a significant commercial activity; however, marine aquaculture has lagged behind. 
This book examines the obstacles to developing marine aquaculture in the United States and offers specific recommendations for technology and policy strategies to encourage this industry. The volume provides a wealth of information on the status of marine aquaculture?including comparisons between U.S. and foreign approaches to policy and technology and of the diverse species under culture. 

Marine Aquaculture also describes problems of coordination of regulatory policy among various federal, state, and local government agencies and escalating competition for the use of coastal waters. It addresses environmental concerns and suggests engineering and research strategies for alleviating negative impacts from marine aquaculture operations.

T1  - Microlivestock:&nbsp;Little-Known Small Animals with a Promising Economic Future
AN  - 2148093625
AB  - Microlivestock is a term coined for species that are inherently small as well as for breeds of cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs that are less than about half the size of the most common breeds. These miniature animals are seldom considered in the broad picture of livestock development, but they seem to have a promising future, especially in developing nations or wherever land is scarce. This book raises awareness of the potential of these small species, including microcattle, microsheep, various poultry, rabbits, rodents, deer, antelope, and lizards. It also strives to stimulate their introduction into animal research and economic development programs.

T1  - Fears, Phobias and Rituals:&nbsp;Panic, Anxiety, and Their Disorders
AN  - 2131184267
AB  - This book draws on fields as diverse as biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, psychology, psychiatry, and ethology, to form a fascinating synthesis of information on the nature of fear and of panic and anxiety disorders. Dr. Marks offers both a detailed discussion of the clinical aspects of fear-related syndromes and a broad exploration of the sources and mechanisms of fear and defensive behavior. Dealing first with normal fear, he establishes a firm, scientific basis for understanding it. He then presents a thorough analysis of the development, symptoms and treatment of fear-related syndromes. Phobic and obsessive-compulsive disorders are examined in detail. The book is illustrated with examples of fear and defensive behavior in other living organisms. By drawing provocative analogies between animal and human behavior, it sheds new light on the origins of fears, phobias, and obsessive-compulsive problems, as well as on their treatment by drugs and psychological means. Clinical psychologists, ethologists, and anyone interested in the mechanisms of behavior will be fascinated by this authoritative study. The text is intriguing and informative, and the bibliography of over 2,100 entries makes it an invaluable reference.
